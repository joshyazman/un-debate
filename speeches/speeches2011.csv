"1",41,"AFG",66,2011,"I am honoured to be here to read the statement of my President  His Excellency Hâmid Karzai  who had to return from New York to Kabul on an urgent basis  following the tragic assassination  through a terrorist plot  of Afghanistan’s former President and Chairman of the High Peace Council  Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani.  The President’s message begins:    “It is a great honour to address the General Assembly at this year’s session  although I regret that I am unable to do so in person. I was here in New York the day before yesterday and had looked forward to attending this important session of the Assembly. I had to return to Kabul after the tragic news of the martyrdom of former President and Chairman of the Afghan High Peace Council  Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani. He was assassinated in a cowardly terrorist plot by the enemies of peace in our country.   “As I speak  the Afghan nation is mourning the loss not only of a valued and deeply respected national figure  but a champion of peace who worked tirelessly  up to the last moment of his distinguished life  for peace in his country. On behalf of the Afghan people  I am grateful for the messages of condolences expressed by leaders around the world at this terrible national loss in Afghanistan.   “As the single largest gathering of nations  the Assembly is the highest manifestation of the plurality of our world. It is also the most solemn opportunity we have  once a year  to bring to global attention our national concerns and to issues that are  in our view  of concern to the wider world.   “Over the past year  the world saw not only political volatility of historic proportions in the Middle East  but also an unabated global economic crisis  huge increases in the prices of food and energy and enormous devastation wrought by natural disasters. Most countries around the world have seen aggravated conditions of life for their peoples  and for many others the future looks continuously bleak. In short  we live in times of uncertainty and crisis  and it is at times like these that international cooperation gains true relevance and meaning.   “Ten days ago  this very city marked the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On behalf of the people of Afghanistan  who have experienced the scourge of terrorism in its worst imaginable form  I pay homage and respect to the memory of the 9/11 tragedy and commiserate with the people of the United States for their sense of loss  which this anniversary has rekindled.   “On this occasion  I urge the Assembly to also reflect on the millions of lives around the world that were touched by terror and violence before 9/11 and those that have been lost to terrorist violence over the 10 years since.    “My country  Afghanistan  has suffered the most  but many — from Pakistan to India  Iraq  Europe and many others around the world — have fallen victim to this modern-day enemy of peace. I urge the Assembly to also honour the sacrifices many nations have made in the fight against terrorism around the world. Above all  however  I ask that we pause and take stock of where we are 10 years after the world was shaken into an unprecedented resolve to act in the face of a common enemy.   “Later this year  Afghanistan will also mark the anniversary of 10 years of the new political era heralded by the end of the Taliban rule and characterized by the beginning of a journey towards a peaceful  prosperous and democratic way of life. There is so much that we have to celebrate in the enormous achievements we have had  with the solidarity and generous help of the international community. These 10 years have been a truly unique chapter in the history of our ancient country.    “Grasping the opportunity  we took bold steps to reunite the country after decades of strife and violence  laying the foundations of a young democracy. Our social and economic accomplishments are phenomenal  greater by comparison than in any other period in our country’s history. Never before have the Afghan people enjoyed comparable access to education and health or seen a greater development of infrastructure across the country.    11-51179 6    “Regrettably  the sense of gratitude and pride we feel at our achievements is tempered by the absence of a key ingredient of any country’s development  namely security. Despite the Afghan people’s sincere embrace of the international fight against terrorism and the immeasurable sacrifices made on this path  we have yet to reap the rewards of experiencing a life free from violence and terror.   “We Afghans are proud to have partnered  over the past 10 years  with the world’s struggle against terrorism. While together we have fought and crushed extremists in some of their long-held strongholds  elsewhere they have continued to thrive. Today  we see a worrying trend towards increased radicalization of the youth. Al-Qaida  despite the elimination of its leaders  remains active in the region  and the Taliban militancy maintains its deadly spectre over my country. Both continue to receive sanctuary and support in the region  which keeps them alive. This sanctuary problem is  without a doubt  the Achilles’ heel of this war.    “To the extent that international terrorism and extremism remain real threats to international security  peace will remain mortgaged to the success of the fight in the region. To succeed  however  we must fundamentally review and adjust our approaches in this fight. It is urgent that we focus our strategy to make our collective struggle more objective and results-oriented. Our enemy must not be defined by a selective treatment of the geography to which we have access  but by an assessment of the threat it poses  regardless of where it may be based.   “The Afghan people remain ardent supporters of the fight against international terrorism  despite having suffered unspeakable losses in this endeavour. However  we fail to see the efficacy of the fight in which ordinary citizens bear the brunt while terrorist sanctuaries remain untouched  far away from the towns and villages of Afghanistan. The continued credibility of the fight will depend above all on taking its focus to where terrorism originates.   “On the other hand  when it comes to the Taliban insurgency  we do not see military action as the only solution. In our eager quest for restoring peace to the lives of our people  we have extended a hand of peace and reconciliation to all those Afghans who have had reason to remain outside the boundaries of the current political process in Afghanistan.   “Led until now by the late Mr. Rabbani  who is tragically no longer among us  through the High Peace Council  and supported by our partners from the international community  the peace process is a comprehensive effort. It covers the reintegration of armed combatants into dignified civilian life and reconciles the leadership of the Taliban.   “The reconciliation policy is based on our commitment to make the political process more inclusive and to provide a genuine and acceptable alternative to violence for all Taliban and other militant leaders  most of whom are currently based outside Afghanistan. Those leaders are welcome to return home and play their proper role in Afghan politics and Government — provided that they break ties with Al-Qaida  give up violent activities and accept the Afghan Constitution. Clearly  without sincere cooperation from regional and international partners  notably the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  this strategy will not succeed.   “The year 2011 is a crucial year for Afghanistan. The most important development for our country was the commencement of the transition process last July. This process will see the complete transfer of security responsibility from international forces to Afghans by the end of 2014. With the completion of the transition process  we Afghans and our international partners will achieve the most important strategic goal of our 10-year partnership: the emergence of a sovereign Afghanistan that is self-reliant and is the peaceful home of all Afghans  an Afghanistan that is at peace and lives in peace with the rest of the world.   “Needless to say  the success of the transition process depends on  besides the demand and solid resolve of the Afghan people  the continued support of the international community. The role of our NATO partners  particularly in terms of the capacity development of our security institutions  will be vital.   7 11-51179    “On the other hand  transition is not just limited to security. Indeed  while transition is both desirable and inevitable  the economic effect of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan needs to be managed carefully. In other words  for Afghanistan to become truly self-reliant  apart from the security transition  we will need a comprehensive economic transition. That transition will take much longer than the security transition and will require the continuation of steadfast support on the part of our international partners beyond 2014.   “In this context  we look forward to the much awaited International Conference on Afghanistan  to be held in Bonn  Germany  on 5 December 2011. Hosted by Germany and chaired by Afghanistan  the Bonn conference will be an opportunity for us to brief our international partners about the major Compact accomplishments of the past 10 years  and in particular about the progress of the Transition and reconciliation processes.   “Most importantly  at Bonn we will call for continued commitment of the international community to assist Afghanistan in the post-2014 period  after the foreign military presence on Afghanistan soil comes to an end. To that end  we will share our vision for the next 10 years — the vision of developing Afghanistan into a stable country  a functioning democracy and a prospering economy. As a country at the centre of an emerging ‘new silk road’  Afghanistan can become a regional hub for trade and transit. This vision is worth all the efforts we Afghans can muster  as well as all the support we can get from the international community.   “As a framework for long-term partnership  we will call for a new paradigm of cooperation between Afghanistan and our friends and partners. The strategic partnership that we are currently negotiating with the United States and other partners  including the European Union  will be a model for the kind of enduring and comprehensive partnership we wish to have with members of the international community. Such partnerships will help guarantee Afghanistan’s security and stability  as well as assist our future economic development. I emphasize that neither our strategic partnership with the United States  nor any other partnerships we will forge in the future  will be a threat to our neighbours or to any other country.   “I also emphasize that in the context of these future partnerships  the principle of Afghan sovereignty and the centrality of the Afghan State must be given due credence; the manner of our continued partnership should conform to the requirements of a sovereign Afghanistan. As an important step in this direction  all the parallel structures created by the international community  be it in the security  governance or development arenas  must be removed to make space for the emergence of genuine and capable indigenous institutions.   “In particular  the role of the United Nations in Afghanistan must be adjusted to the requirements of Afghan sovereignty. I welcome the review of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan  as authorized by the Secretary-General. In the months ahead  we look forward to participating in this review and to its positive conclusion.   “On the subject of regional cooperation  we are currently working closely with Afghanistan’s old friend and brother  the Republic of Turkey  towards a regional conference to be held in Istanbul on 2 November 2011. Hosted by Turkey and championed by Afghanistan  the Istanbul Conference will help build a common regional vision for peace and stability. The Conference will recognize Afghanistan’s quest for stability  as well as the region’s growing need for confidence-building and cooperation in the face of the common challenges we face  notably terrorism  extremism  the drug trade and obstacles to legitimate interaction and movement  to name but a few.   “Over the past 10 years  we have undertaken numerous initiatives to promote regional cooperation  mainly with a view to trade and economic activities. However  we have learned that unless we boldly address our political differences and the deficit of trust and confidence that divides the region  regional cooperation will remain an aspiration. It is for that very reason that at the Istanbul Conference we will aim to focus on political and security issues.    11-51179 8    “In the coming weeks  we will expect to consult with all countries in the Heart of Asia region to develop a common understanding in the run-up to the Conference.   “In today’s interconnected world  developments in Afghanistan and the surrounding region are hugely influenced by events in the wider world. Therefore  we in Afghanistan are closely watching the situation in the Middle East. As a nation that has experienced war and destruction for many years  the eruption of violence in these countries fills us with anxiety. We are particularly concerned by the developments in Libya. We recognize the National Transitional Council as the legitimate Government of Libya. However  based on our own experience  we urge the brotherly Libyan nation to recall that the shortest route to peace will be through ensuring inclusivity and safeguarding the unity of the Libyan nation.   “The people of Afghanistan deeply sympathize with the plight of our brothers and sisters in Palestine. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to their suffering and the realization of their inalienable rights  including the right to an independent State. In this connection  we stand firmly behind the efforts aimed at Palestine’s admission as a full Member    of the United Nations. I hope that this year we will witness  with pride  the inclusion of Palestine as the 194th Member of the United Nations.   “The Afghan people also shared the pain of the loss experienced by the Japanese people when the natural disasters struck earlier this year. Japan is a longstanding friend of Afghanistan  and we are confident that this great nation will soon overcome the challenges of recovery.   “The Assembly is a manifestation of our collective will to stand together against the challenges that face human society and to realize the potential for a peaceful and prosperous world for all. Our gathering here is also a testimony to the valuable role that the United Nations plays in the realization of our collective will. I applaud the remarkable leadership that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has demonstrated in steering the United Nations in a direction where it can truly become an asset to a peaceful world.   “Finally  many countries from across the globe have stood in solidarity  over the past 10 years  with the Afghan people. On behalf of the people of Afghanistan  I again thank them for their support.”"
"2",80,"AGO",66,2011,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the work of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and to assure him of Angola’s support and cooperation in ensuring success in the work of this session. I also want to express our gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the competent and impartial manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.   Allow me to also congratulate the Secretary-General on his reappointment and to assure him of my Government’s support for the success of his very complex and demanding mission in the service of peace and cooperation among nations  a cornerstone of the mandate embodied in the Charter of the Organization.  We congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on its admission as a Member of the United Nations. We wish South Sudan a future of peace and prosperity and would like to say that the Government of Angola stands ready to cooperate with this new State’s efforts to consolidate its independence and its socio-economic development.  We also welcome the establishment of UN-Women. We are certain that it will give further impetus to the promotion and empowerment of women and the achievement of their legitimate rights.  This session of the General Assembly takes place at a particularly complex juncture in the international situation  which is characterized by so many crises that   11 11-51398  I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that they challenge the very foundations of our international Organization. If we were to list them  although not exhaustively  we could mention the current economic and financial crisis  which triggered the most serious social crisis witnessed to date by our generation; a dangerous environmental crisis of unpredictable consequences for the future of humankind  which will be irreversible unless the international community as a whole applies immediate and courageous measures; and a general escalation of violence and outbreak of conflict  which  combined with the environmental crisis  has caused the most serious humanitarian crisis that humankind has witnessed since the end of the Second World War. In brief  we are living in dangerous times  where a combination of factors is endangering stability  peace and security in the world.  The analysis of the current international situation made by the majority of the speakers who preceded me  and which we agree with  constitutes an appeal to our collective responsibility.  A particularly disturbing factor is the current economic and financial crisis  which has affected virtually every country in the world  in particular developing countries  with serious consequences for political stability and social cohesion.  It is therefore urgent that we find solutions to these problems. That will require strengthening international cooperation on the basis of greater justice and equality. Moreover  it is urgent that we take measures aimed at deepening economic reforms within States that promote economic growth and social development.  Angola is extensively affected by the international economic and financial crisis. We have therefore adopted a set of measures to mitigate its most adverse effects. Without prejudice to the maintenance of macroeconomic balance  we have focused considerable resources on social development and combating poverty.  The theme of this session of the General Assembly — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes through peaceful means” — reflects the deep concern of the international community with regard to the need for an integrated approach to resolving conflicts that affect it. That is what makes it necessary to implement mediation efforts after conflicts have started. Conflict prevention should be the key element in the management of any area of tension.  Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms  the rule of law and good governance are key elements in ensuring that any human society can live in peace and harmony. They are also the main guarantors of effective conflict prevention.  There are other elements I would like to mention that are also important causes of the spread of conflict. I am referring here to external interference  which  in gross violation of international law  frequently obstructs efforts at mediation and peaceful resolution and prevents the reaching of solutions to conflicts.  Angola has paid a very high price as a result of such interference  which for too long compounded a fratricidal conflict that Angolans were finally able to settle and wisely overcome with magnanimity  fairness and inclusion  thanks to the leadership of our President. The role of Angola and its contribution to internal and regional peace should be seen in the broader context of conflict resolution. In that regard  the implementation of the landmark Security Council resolution 435 (1978) led to the independence of Namibia and created the conditions for peaceful coexistence in a region that had endured extreme hostility and constituted a permanent threat to world peace.  Imbued with a spirit of fraternity  the Government of Angola has spared no effort in pursuing its policy of effective reconciliation  which has allowed the reconciliation of all its children who were previously involved in the conflict. There has been genuine investment in peace  which has been a decisive factor in the process of post-conflict reconstruction. Angola has served as a reference point for the resolution of several conflicts on the African continent. Moreover  we have spared no effort in sharing our experiences with other peoples and countries.   Also in the context of conflict resolution  it is important to strengthen the role of multilateralism while adhering to the principle of shared responsibility and shared benefits  recognizing the legitimate interests of all parties and engaging in consultations and dialogue in the search for workable solutions to international peace and security issues.  There is therefore a need to refer to the instruments of cooperation between the Security Council and the African Union  as well as to the role of    11-51398 12  the United Nations and regional institutions in preventing and resolving conflicts. It is of crucial importance to strengthen the action of regional organizations in the management of situations that may constitute threats to peace and security. In that connection  the Security Council has the primary role in preventing and resolving conflicts and in maintaining peace  in accordance with the powers conferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations.   The central theme of our debate has drawn attention to the need for reform of the Security Council  including the imperative of achieving fair representation for all regions and increasing the number of permanent members  thereby adapting the Council to contemporary reality.  With regard to peaceful cooperation at the regional level  Angola is a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the Economic Community of Central African States  the Gulf of Guinea Commission and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)  which  with several partners  has acted on the basis of preventive diplomacy in the search for peaceful solutions to the various crises that have arisen.  With regard to the constitutional crisis in Madagascar  SADC mediated the recent signing by all parties involved of the road map for the implementation of the reconciliation process  which is intended to lead to elections and the restoration of constitutional order. That was an important breakthrough in the process  which Angola welcomes.  Guinea-Bissau  our brotherly country and partner in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  has been the subject of special attention by Angola. As part of the CPLP  Angola and other member States have striven to establish a strategic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States under the coordination of the United Nations  aiming to bring political stability to the country so that it can carry out major structural reforms  in particular the reform of the defence and security sectors. We welcome the positive developments that the country is now experiencing and we encourage the authorities of Guinea-Bissau to vigorously pursue the process of stabilization.  The drought in the Horn of Africa is a cause of deepest concern for my country and the entire international community. The consequences of drought in Somalia are felt even more profoundly due to the prevalence of armed conflict  which compounds the humanitarian crisis  shocks the world’s conscience and calls for a redoubled effort by the international community. Angola has joined the international humanitarian assistance efforts under way  as well as the search for political solutions to end the armed conflict and open new prospects for a better future for the Somali people.  With regard to the situation in Libya  the Angolan Government hopes that the Libyan people can find stability in the very near term. That can only be achieved through the free exercise of their democratic rights. In that regard  Angola urges the National Transitional Council to promote genuine national reconciliation and to form an inclusive Government  as those are prerequisites for ensuring that Libya can regain its rightful place in the African and international arenas. However  we must make use of lessons learned with a view to achieving more effective cooperation between external partners and the African Union in seeking joint solutions based on international law and mutual respect.  Angola remains concerned about the limited progress in addressing the problem of Western Sahara  which remains an important issue on the international agenda. We call on the warring parties to resume negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union  so that the people of Western Sahara can exercise their right to self-determination.  The situation in the Middle East  particularly in the Palestinian territories  is one of the most serious problems facing the international community. Angola is witnessing with great concern the escalation of the conflict and the lack of progress towards a solution of the Palestinian question. In line with the general position of the international community regarding the conflict  my country advocates the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  living side by side with the State of Israel  in peace and security  within secure internationally recognized borders.  As in previous sessions  the sixty-sixth session of General Assembly will address the embargo imposed on Cuba  which violates the rules of international free trade. In spite of the timid steps taken towards normalizing the situation  Angola reiterates its position of principle by reaffirming the need to end the embargo against Cuba.   13 11-51398   Angola has been making its contribution to finding solutions to the most pressing problems. Within the broader international community  we have sought to cooperate with all countries based on mutual respect and interests  upholding the highest ideals of peace and cooperation for development. We will continue on this path  firmly believing that the defence and promotion of these principles contribute to the development and advancement of all peoples."
"3",127,"ALB",66,2011,"First  I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly on his election. I wish him every success in leading the work of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I would like to express my gratitude to his predecessor for his invaluable contribution. May I also take this opportunity to extend special thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his excellent organization of this session and for his wise and determined leadership at the helm of the   29 11-51360  United Nations over the past few years. I wish him the utmost success over the four years ahead.  Our world today is experiencing major and complex crises that threaten the peace and stability of several regions and our planet as a whole. However  this year’s spring was a great and historic one for Africa and the entire world. More than 125 million oppressed people stood up with courage  determination and sacrifice and overthrew tyrannical regimes in five countries in Africa and opened the gates of freedom for their nations.  As a representative of a country that only 20 years ago brought down the Hoxhaist dictatorship — the worst that Albania and Europe had ever known — I would like to cordially welcome and salute the representatives of Egypt  Tunisia  Libya  South Sudan and Ivory Coast who are present at this Assembly session. Today  we pay tribute to the thousands of citizens of those countries who with great courage and legendary bravery lost their lives in order to liberate their countries from ruthless tyrannies and who made their countries  the African continent and the entire world more free and more just than ever. With their sacrifices  however  those who fought and fell in the name of freedom have delivered a sacred message to the very hearts and minds of all oppressed people on our planet: Be not afraid!  On the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the communist dictatorship  despite the unquestionable difficulties inherent in building a democracy based on market values  Albania has continuously affirmed that for the individual  our society and our nation as a whole freedom is the greatest of all assets and riches.  Twenty years ago  Albania was one of the three poorest countries in the world  plagued by extreme poverty and chronic starvation. Today  Albania belongs to the group of countries with middle to upper income levels. Formerly a totally hyper-collectivized country  today it has the smallest public sector in Europe  with more than 84 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) coming from the private sector.  Twenty years ago  human rights and freedoms were forbidden under the country’s Constitution. Today  Albania is a country with a functional democracy  freedom of speech and free elections and in which there is full respect for minority rights and religious tolerance par excellence.  Albania was the most isolated country in the world. Now  it is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty alliance and makes its contribution to peace and stability in the region and beyond  while remaining firmly focused on its path towards European Union integration. Today  Albanians travel freely throughout Europe  while the number of foreign citizens who have visited Albania for tourism and other purposes has increased  from 300 000 in 2004 to 3.5 million last year.  Recently  during this period of major European and global financial crises  Albania’s economy remained one of the few in the world that did not experience a recession. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that global foreign direct investment decreased by 37 per cent from 2007 to 2010  while the same source confirms that in Albania it grew by 316 per cent from 2006 to 2010. Over the past few years  Albanian exports have grown by 300 per cent. Unemployment has decreased  and so has poverty  by a margin of some 30 per cent. Our economic model is based entirely on economic freedom. Last year  that freedom suffered a major setback worldwide  whereas in my country it increased by 16 per cent.  The Albanian economy is not detached from the global economy. In fact  the opposite is true: being a small economy  it is linked to and affected by it. That is why I believe that four main factors determine its performance.  The first factor is a small government and public sector. Albania’s public administration and public sector are at least 50 per cent smaller than those of any other similarly sized country in the region and beyond. Furthermore  I am pleased to state that my Government ranks among the top 10 Governments with the lowest level of interference in the economy.  Secondly  Albania is a country of flat-rate taxes. At 10 per cent  its fiscal burden is the lowest in Europe. The increase in fiscal freedoms and the successful fight against corruption allowed our country to double its budgetary revenue from customs and taxes in four years’ time.    11-51360 30   Thirdly  we invested heavily in infrastructure to stimulate growth. My Government has spent 8 per cent to 10 per cent of our GDP on road infrastructure alone  three years in a row. A total of 8 000 km of new roads have been constructed  more than in the entire history of the country. Within the next two years  Albania will have a new and modern road infrastructure that will allow our citizens as well as foreign visitors to reach our capital  Tirana  from any part of the country in 60 per cent less time than previously required.  Fourthly  we have made it easier to open a business or expand an existing one by putting in place an efficient digital one-stop-shopping system for business registrations  licences and permits  and by drastically reducing bureaucratic procedures.  Yet the debt and the euro crisis are hanging like the sword of Damocles over our national currency  the lek  and our economy. I take this opportunity to call upon the countries of the eurozone to take into consideration the effects of the crisis on our economy and others that are closely linked to the euro.  The greatest desire and fondest dream of all Albanians is to see Albania become a developed country. I know that the road ahead of us is not smooth; it may be bumpy at times  but it is also the one that will take us higher and higher. I am convinced that it is a righteous and a sure path of hope by which the dream of a fully developed Albania will come true.  To achieve that dream  the Government of Albania is committed to sustainable development. Developing countries and emerging markets such as that of Albania face countless difficulties  but they also have the advantage of learning from the mistakes of developed countries and being able to avoid them. With that in mind  we are determined to turn Albania into a small superpower of renewable energy in the region. With its rich water resources  Albania resembles a small Norway on the Balkan peninsula. My Government has already signed with the private sector a concessional contract for the construction of 220 of the 450 hydropower stations that are to be built. Companies from all over Europe and the rest of the world are already engaged in that process.  Additionally  major natural wind platforms exist throughout the country  and the Government has given and is giving licenses for the production of thousands of megawatts of electricity by wind parks. Albania is also one of the sunniest places in Europe  and the Government is determined to exploit solar as well as geothermal energy.  I believe that in addition to the major efforts necessary to achieve an international legal framework to prevent global warming and lower greenhouse-gas emissions  we must speedily reach an agreement stipulating that a percentage of the aid that generous donors are offering to support this cause be used for the purpose of supporting private-sector companies that are focused on renewable energy projects. Such funds could be used to cover the cost of the loan interest incurred in realizing renewable energy projects. I am sure that they will increase manifold the production of renewable energy in the very near future.  To combat climate change and improve environmental conditions  forestation is also very important. The United Nations Billion Tree Campaign has been met with a successful response by many countries and deserves credit as a first important step. However  our potential is much greater.  The Government of Albania has started an ambitious programme aimed at taking advantage of our country’s potential in terms of fruit trees. We intend to plant  in the next eight years  some 50 million olive trees and around 200 million nut trees of different varieties. The project  which started two years ago  is subsidized by public funds. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that this project is moving rapidly ahead and that it has given rise to a real and unprecedented tree-planting passion on the part of my fellow citizens. Albania will welcome any and all help from the United Nations and its Member States to successfully complete this project.  Albania fully supports the Open Government Partnership initiated by the President of the United States  Barack Obama  and the President of Brazil  Dilma Rousseff; that is why we have joined the initiative. Our efforts towards an open Government have as a primary objective the project entitled “Albania in the digital age”. In a short time  we have expanded access to the Internet to all our schools and have started offering free Internet service to every citizen in all post offices throughout the country.  A total of 2.1 million Albanians have availed themselves of this opportunity and have surfed the Internet  many of them for the first time in their lives. This has helped increase the percentage of the population in Albania using the Internet from a mere   31 11-51360  4.8 per cent in early 2006 to 60 per cent today — roughly two thirds of the population. Free Internet service will continue to be available in all post offices and in some additional offices to be opened for that purpose. Moreover  the Government is fully committed to making super-broadband Internet available over the next two years and to guaranteeing one-stop-shopping services to citizens throughout the country.  We believe that the digital age is above all the age of transparency. Based on this belief  Albania two years ago became the first country in the world with a 100 per cent electronic procurement system certified by the United Nations. That system has led to a sixfold increase in participating public bids  reducing procurement costs by 27 per cent. Today Albania is a country featuring e-tax  e-customs  e-university admissions  and e-business registration and e-civil status registry. The Government intends to offer all those services and others in a one-stop-shop context in the very near future.  E-government and transparency strengthen democracy  and our law also guarantees free access for our citizens to all acts  decisions and public expenditures of the Government. In order to strengthen the role of civil society  my Government has for the past two years had a specific budgetary provision in that respect that is entirely administered by an independent board of civil society.  Albania has excellent relations with its immediate neighbours and  in general  with the countries of the region. We would like to develop and consolidate further relations with the Republic of Serbia as well. I am very pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government of Kosovo possesses an equally strong will in the area of good-neighbourly relations and has shown assiduous commitment and seriousness in the process of negotiations in Brussels. The International Court of Justice decided in July last year in The Hague that Kosovo’s declaration of independence was in full compliance with international law.   The Republic of Kosovo has been recognized by more than 80 States  and I take this opportunity to call upon the rest of the States Members of the United Nations to recognize the independent republic of Kosovo  which has become  in fact  an important factor for peace  stability and cooperation in our region. I also call upon Serbia  which went through the General Assembly to ask the opinion of the International Court of Justice  to adapt its position in line with the decision of the Court  thus demonstrating that it accepts and respects international law in its entirety and not only those parts that serve its cause.  In accordance with President Ahtisaari’s package  and in close cooperation with the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX)  the International Security Force in Kosovo (KFOR) and other international institutions present in the country  the republic of Kosovo has put in place and implemented the highest standards in the region and beyond as regards the freedoms and rights of minorities.  The most worrying problems for the Serbs in Kosovo today are the tensions created and orchestrated for nationalistic purposes. Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo is today more secure than ever. It is a precious cultural heritage not only for the Serbs in Kosovo but also for Albanians and all other citizens of Kosovo  as well as for Serbia  the entire region and the whole of Europe. I would like to reassure the representatives of the Member States that the only threat Serbs in Kosovo face is that of being exploited to serve the purposes of a bitter past that must not ever return.  Meanwhile  inter-ethnic relations in all areas where Serbs and Albanians live together in the same communities are very good. However  the parallel structures funded by Belgrade in the three Serbian homogeneous communes in northern Mitrovica  where no other ethnic groups reside  have turned them into a safe haven for organized crime and smuggling and trafficking of all sorts.   The Government of the republic of Kosovo is determined to implement the rule of law in those communes and engage in effective border and customs control  in full compliance with the agreement reached in Brussels and the Ahtisaari document. Those efforts  however  have met strong resistance from criminal groups and organized gangs that  with weapons and other means  are doing all in their power to block the rule of law. We have supported and will continue to support the Government of Kosovo  EULEX and KFOR in their efforts to strengthen law and order in all the territory of the republic of Kosovo so that peace and stability will prevail.   I also call on Serbia to do its best to remove the obstacles to the flow of goods across its border with Kosovo  and to respect the agreement signed this month in Brussels  which forbids the embargo and    11-51360 32  provides for freedom of export and import for both countries. We believe that respect for the actual borders in the Balkans is a fundamental condition for lasting peace and stability. Belgrade’s efforts to keep parallel structures of authority in place in those three communes demonstrate that it still believes in reshaping borders in our region based on the failed and long-outdated idea of ethnically clean countries and the concept of Greater Serbia.  The Republic of Serbia  in accordance with international law  has arrested the butcher of the Balkans and  albeit too late  his lieutenants as well  and has received the due appreciation of the international community for doing so. However  I invite Serbia to cooperate in the search for and return of the remains of 1 500 men  women  children and elderly who were abducted from their homes and massacred in the territory of Serbia only because they were Albanians. It is very important to cleanse one’s country of those who have committed crimes against humanity  but it is also important not to hide or cover over the graves of their victims.   Here yesterday  President Tadic characterized as true the accusations raised by Mr. Dick Marty regarding the alleged traffic in organs and mass killings committed by Albanians in the territory of Albania. Regarding that report  I would like to state here the stance of the Albanian Government. Dick Marty’s report — as acknowledged by the Chief Prosecutor of Serbia  Vladimir Vukcevic  who has stated that his own report is fully included in Marty’s report — is in fact a cut-and-paste of the Vukcevic’s report. Every person who reads that report sees that it raises many allegations that are not at all based on facts or the truth but rather motivated by sinister intention.   The Dick Marty report — or rather let us call it the Dick Marty/Vukcevic report — does not produce even a single fact. I must clarify that in fact it synthesizes Carla Del Ponte’s memoir  which seem to have derived from the same unique source. In the thousands of pages of transcripts of the interrogation of Slobodan Miloševic and his accusations against Albanians  there is not a single word of accusation on his part about organ trafficking or mass graves in my country. The purpose of the report is to divert attention from the decision of the International Court of Justice in favour of the independence of Kosovo.  Nevertheless  the Government of Albania has officially asked its delegation in the Council of Europe to vote to endorse the report for the sole purpose of opening the door to a thorough international investigation. My Government sent an invitation to EULEX  and we welcome the fact the EULEX accepted it. I assure everyone here that my country will fully cooperate fully with EULEX and its task force so that the truth about such inventions will be made known. When I read them for the first time in Carla Del Ponte’s memoir  they reminded me of Agatha Christie. I want the EULEX team to come and clarify everything about those fictions.  Despite all this  our region has made extraordinary progress  and efforts to cooperate in building a common future in the European Union are prevailing every day. My country is doing its best and is investing heavily in infrastructure to create new links  new roads and new lines of communication with all our neighbours. I believe that the time has come when Albanians and Serbs will try to start archiving the past and looking for a common future in the best interests of their nations.   From this rostrum  President Abbas made his request to the General Assembly for Palestine’s membership of the United Nations as an independent State. While my Government fully supports the idea of an independent Palestine  I believe that unilateral action will not be helpful. That is why I call on our Palestinian friends to support the statement made yesterday by the Quartet  in which it drew a clear road map for action to address this fundamental question of our time."
"4",150,"AND",66,2011,"First of all  I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his well-deserved reappointment  and Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  It is with pride  a sense of responsibility and a will for cooperation and proactivity that I address this Hall in the name of the Principality of Andorra and the Government that I have the honour to represent. The United Nations and the system of international law that emanates from it place all States on an equal footing. That is especially important for States like Andorra  small in terms of territorial dimension but large in values and in history.  Recent years have been marked by a profound crisis of multiple aspects — economic  social  environmental and political — but most especially a crisis of values. Now that we must all lay the foundation for recovery  we need to be quite clear about the values and principles on which we wish to continue constructing the world. We do not need to go much further than the founding spirit of the General    11-51398 22  Assembly  an institution in which all — large and small  the wealthier and the less endowed — address one another on equal terms to promote peace  liberty and justice.   Just as the United Nations arose after a world war that turned the world as it had existed until then upside down  now again we have to be able to define the moral and political bases of a new order. One priority set by the United Nations is inclusive and sustainable development. There can be no sustainability without inclusion. And if the Assembly  which arose from the debris of a devastating war  is to give a voice to all the peoples of the planet  we have to be capable now of ensuring that no one is excluded from the future that we forge together.  We must take care that the economic recovery from the recession does not further accentuate the inequalities — understood as a lack of equity — that already exist. Thus  just as international law protects nations like ours that have no military potential  so too economic growth must be especially attentive to the more vulnerable in order to prevent the consequences of the recession from falling systematically on them.  Thirty years ago  in 1981  the United Nations held its first Conference on the Least Developed Countries. The fourth Conference was held last spring  attesting to the difficulty of achieving significant changes to improve the weakness and vulnerability of those States. Further  we observe with concern how  against the background of the global recession  some of the more developed countries often adopt protectionist attitudes. On the conviction that a freer world is a more just world  we also have to state that a more open and less protectionist world leads to a more equitable balance and improvements for the disadvantaged.  Andorra  with its small scale  secular stability and seclusion among mountains  is dealing with the far-reaching process of opening its economy. We also have planned the construction of a model of inclusive growth that leaves no one out — a model that cannot be constructed by turning one’s back on the international community or by being isolated from the world.  I have been talking about economic opening  but the opening to the world cannot be strictly economic  and it is crystal clear that recovery from the crisis and a new phase of growth will not come about solely as a result of economic measures. The search for an inclusive and sustainable balance must necessarily involve addressing factors that are not strictly economic but that do accentuate inequalities between countries.  In that connection  we note the work done at the 2011 High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on AIDS held in June and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution 65/277) adopted by the participating States  stating their intension to intensify their efforts in the fight against this pandemic. In spite of the advances achieved in recent years  HIV is a symbol of how necessary it is for progress to reach everyone equally. While in the more developed countries AIDS has become a chronic illness appropriately treated  in the more disadvantaged areas — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — the disease is still lethal  especially in the communities with the fewest resources.   Above and beyond the increase of resources for research and treatment and greater North-South cooperation  I am convinced that the extension of democracy and human rights is also a key factor in the fight against a pandemic that overwhelms the poorest  but that also hits peoples submerged in ignorance and oppression.  With all of that  the extent of the commitments made and the progress achieved by various States in the fight against HIV should be a source of satisfaction  since seldom has the international community been capable of articulating a response so rapid and unanimous when faced with a threat on this scale. It would be wonderful if the same level of awareness and commitment could be achieved in the fight against non-communicable diseases  such as cardiovascular disease  cancer and diabetes. Those also — although perhaps not so clearly as in the case of AIDS — are diseases that accentuate the inequalities among countries. That principle was recognized in the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2) of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases held recently.  Such successes cannot allow us to forget that one of the most serious challenges facing the international community and this Assembly  which is its highest representation  is the fight against climate change. To date  humankind was used to overcoming recessions and times of crisis  entering a new phase of growth    23 11-51398  without thinking of the negative external effects of that growth. We now know that growth cannot be at any price and that development must be sustainable in economic terms  but also  and more particularly  in environmental terms.   That is why the threat of climate change is as great as or stronger than that of the global recession. Some developed countries  in particular those that survive on their own natural resources  are seriously threatened by climate change. That may also be the case for Andorra  which bases a good part of its economic welfare on snow and mountain tourism. That is why we will always support any initiative aiming at greater awareness of the need to combat climate change  and take steps to adapt to what is probably already a reality. In that context  we should underscore the entry into force in Andorra of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 31 May.  We should never lose sight of the fact that the main goal of the United Nations is to guarantee peace and security in a context of freedom and respect for human rights. Just as in the past  States emerged to ensure the social peace and individual freedom of their citizens  the United Nations also have their raison d’être in the maintenance of peace and security and the rule of international law.  Today  we speak of inclusive and sustainable economic growth and of a new and profound awareness of the threat of climate change. We cannot forget that such issues are closely linked to the promotion of a safer world. Growth that leaves more vulnerable groups behind and that excludes the least developed countries  added to the effects of climate change  leads to a less safe and less stable world.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the tragic attacks of 11 September here in New York  the seat of United Nations Headquarters. As President Obama recalled last Wednesday (see )  we are today seeing the symbol of New York’s renewal rise at ground zero  where 10 years ago there was an open wound and twisted steel  a shattered heart in the centre of the city.  This year  we close the first decade of the millennium without having resolved the threat to the security of our world  that is  international terrorism. Despite progress on that front  the threat continues. Terrorism arises from hatred and wickedness. However  we must be aware that it dwells  in particular  where there is a lack of economic prospects  illiteracy  lack of culture  poverty  marginality — where  in short  there is a lack of democracy.  That is why  in the promotion of a safer world  our efforts will always be needed to combat all kinds of discrimination. In that regard  I wish to underscore the political declaration against racism  racial discrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance that was adopted at that time during the General Assembly. It is also 10 years since the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Today  as the States represented here  we say that we cannot afford to lower our guard since  in an increasingly globalized and complex world  the threat of discrimination is growing.  At the beginning of my statement  I spoke of the need to continue building the world on the principles and values that inspire this Assembly. Allow me now to recall the spirit and the philosophy of the twenty-eighth President of the United States  President Wilson  father of the League of Nations  the precursor of today’s United Nations. Wilson taught us that it was of little use to be democrats at home if we were not capable of exporting democracy beyond our borders  and that a State that turned its back on countries still living under oppression and in which the most fundamental rights and freedoms were not respected could not presume to be democratic.  That is why we must welcome with an especially positive attitude what we have called the Arab Spring. We sincerely hope that those movements for democracy strengthen in the future. In that context  in July  we supported South Sudan becoming the 193rd member of the United Nations. Today  we are pleased at that reality and we most warmly welcome it. A more democratic world is a more dynamic world  but also safer because it is fairer. Most failures of security in our world  as I said a moment ago  are fuelled by injustice.  Likewise  with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  we must keep encouraging dialogue and mediation. The Palestinian people’s aspiration to have a democratic and peaceful State is as legitimate as the Israeli desire to obtain guarantees for its existence and security. The final aim of a mutual recognition of two States by two peoples  on the basis of the 1967 lines with the agreed and equivalent exchanges  is now under discussion.     11-51398 24   A possible intermediate step  in a shorter term  by becoming an observer State could represent an element of hope for the Palestinian people  provided that it is not used for purposes that are incompatible with continuing negotiations  but for the aforementioned goal. Israel also must contribute to that spirit  avoiding attitudes that could affect the final status.  Andorra is a country that has lived for more than 700 years without an army  without taking part in any war and without internal conflicts. The perpetual peace and permanent stability  of which we Andorrans are proud  is not founded on an autocratic regime that controls its people with an iron fist or on a whim resulting from the deterrence of larger or more powerful neighbours. No  the ultimate reason for a peace and security maintained for more than seven centuries has been the ongoing effort to respect individual rights and freedoms and the rule of justice and of fairness  and the existence of mechanisms of solidarity  as was well demonstrated in the recent universal periodic review.  Our democracy and our centuries-old parliamentary system are not the fruit of peace and stability  but the reverse. Peace  security and stability are the fruits of democracy because  without democracy  there is no possibility of peace or lasting security either in Andorra or anywhere in the world.  From the position of humility that governs our support for the United Nations  we wish to reaffirm here the idea of commitment as a fundamental value and the linchpin of our political action. That commitment is understood as a deep belief not only in peace and equal opportunities  but also as an involvement in and shouldering of individual responsibilities regarding a common project and  last but not least  as a wish for dialogue and understanding. On Wednesday  President Sarkozy stated in this Assembly: “Let us choose the path of compromise  which is neither renunciation nor repudiation  but which allows us to move forward  step by step” (). Andorra will continue to work towards such a commitment within the Organization. "
"5",195,"ARE",66,2011,"It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of this session  who is the Permanent Representative of our sister State of Qatar  for his election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that his experience in international political and diplomatic affairs will contribute to the success of this session’s work. I wish him every success. I also wish to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Joseph Deiss  for his outstanding leadership of the previous session of the General Assembly. In addition  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon on the renewed confidence in him and his reappointment as Secretary-General of this international Organization for a second term. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of South Sudan for joining our international Organization as a State Member of the United Nations  along with the people of Libya for their Transitional National Council’s taking Libya’s seat in the United Nations.  Addressing enormous international challenges depends on the extent of consolidated and collective work  with the participation of all States  including the small and developing ones  in international decision-making structures  institutions and mechanisms  based on the principles of equality  justice and transparency.  My country has therefore undertaken extensive preventive diplomatic efforts in order to contain the tensions and disputes occurring in its surroundings and beyond. The United Arab Emirates vigorously seeks to enhance its humanitarian and economical programmes to several developing countries  particularly to those countries undergoing conflicts or natural disasters  in addition to its other effective contributions to peacekeeping operations  protection of civilians  and re-building efforts. Those contributions represent our significant partnership with several parties  and our dedication to achieve the noble objectives of maintaining and consolidating international peace and security.  The solid strategic political approach adopted by the United Arab Emirates is not limited to bilateral and regional cooperation; it is also evident in the way we handle all issues. My country seeks to establish peace and security  eliminate tensions from the region and enhance confidence-building measures. We apply the same approach in dealing with the occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the three Emirate islands of Abu Musa  and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. Since the illegitimate occupation of those islands in 1971  my country has adopted a flexible diplomatic approach to resolve this issue through peaceful means  either through direct bilateral negotiations  or by referring the    11-51390 8  matter to the International Court of Justice. This has been our approach throughout the last four decades.  However  the United Arab Emirates expresses its deep concern over the lack of progress in direct  regional and international contacts made so far with the Islamic Republic of Iran with a view to reaching a peaceful  just and permanent solution. The actions taken by Iran with the aim of changing the legal  physical and demographic situation of the islands are null and void and have no legal effect whatsoever. Those Iranian actions also constitute a violation of international law  as well as of the United Nations Charter. Therefore  we call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to enter into serious and direct negotiations between the two countries  or to refer the issue to the International Court of Justice in light of its continuous illegal occupation of the three islands  which are an integral part of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates.  We have been closely monitoring the major developments and complications surrounding the Palestinian issue  which unfortunately resulted in halting the efforts and chances of resuming peace talks. It is time to resolve this issue in all its humanitarian  legal and political aspects. The core of the solution for this issue lies in the establishment of a full-fledged sovereign State within the 4 June 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital. Comprehensive and just peace between Arab countries and Israel would greatly assist in reducing tensions and deprive the voices of extremism and violence from using this ongoing issue as a major justifications for their extremism and violence.   My country has been closely monitoring the recent events in the brotherly Kingdom of Bahrain  which have adversely affected its peace and stability. While we are extending every required support to the Kingdom of Bahrain  we denounce any external intervention in Bahrain’s internal affairs.  We believe that the measures and good efforts undertaken by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain to promote national dialogue among all segments of Bahraini society are important steps that seek to maintain peace and stability in the Kingdom  preserve civil peace  strengthen national unity and pursue reforms and progress  in a manner that will realize the hopes and aspirations of all the people of Bahrain.   We emphasize that the sovereignty  security and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Bahrain are an integral part of the security and stability of the Arabian Gulf region  and also part of the responsibilities of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council in the region. All members of the Council are keen to consolidate good neighbourly relations with all States  based on the principles of international law and other international instruments.  The United Arab Emirates renews through this international platform its full commitment to the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and national unity of Libya. We also stress our commitment to Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) with regard to the protection of civilians. Since the beginning of the Libyan crisis  we have focused on the humanitarian assistance aspect and the protection of civilians. We realized these goals within the efforts of the international community. We will continue to support Libya and its people in the upcoming reconstruction phase. We believe that the honourable people of Libya and its leadership are capable of identifying the characteristics of next phase in order to enhance Libya’s stature within the international community and strengthen its development and stability. To this end  my country calls on our international partners to intensify their efforts to release the remaining Libyan frozen assets.   My country has also made substantial direct contributions for the reconstruction of Afghanistan  for restoring peace and stability in the country and for alleviating the suffering of its people. Success in this regard will be a focal point in countering extremism  militancy  and international terrorism in the Arabian Gulf region. In addition  peace and security in Afghanistan have a direct impact on regional security and on the security of the Arab Gulf region. From this platform  I call on all Afghani parties to cooperate in achieving a process of comprehensive national reconciliation and extending the control of the Government over all Afghani regions. We also look forward to the international conference on Afghanistan to be held in Bonn next December.   Food security is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. It is estimated that in 2010 more than 900 million people worldwide suffered from chronic hunger. The recent tragedy of famine in the Horn of Africa has demonstrated the urgent need for concrete efforts on the part of the international   9 11-51390  community to ensure protection for the most vulnerable peoples in times of crisis.  In a serious discussion of the issue of food security  we cannot overlook the significance of water security  especially in view of the fact that agricultural production consumes around 70 per cent of fresh water resources globally. My country therefore deems it important to include the issue of water scarcity and security in future plans aimed at increasing food production worldwide. Living as we do in a region that suffers from a scarcity of water  we are more aware of its importance  which prompts us to stress the need for the international community to tackle this challenge decisively and urgently.  In December  my country will celebrate its fortieth anniversary. One of the major successes and positive indicators of human development that we have achieved has been the advancement and empowerment of Emirati women. With the support of our leadership and society  we have been able to arrive at the optimum balance between our traditions and the demands of development and participation required to build our society. In this context  I would like to take the opportunity commend the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). In support of this newly established and promising entity  the United Arab Emirates hereby announces its contribution of $5 million to the UN-Women fund.  In conclusion  we hope that our deliberations at this session of the Assembly will contribute to the promotion and development of all forms of understanding  solidarity and international cooperation aimed at addressing the global issues on our agenda."
"6",242,"ARG",66,2011,"Exactly eight years ago  in this same context and from this same rostrum  the President of my country  Néstor Carlos Kirchner  addressed the Assembly  four years after having assumed the presidency of the Argentine Republic with only 22 per cent of the vote. Given the situation of the Argentine Republic — which had fallen into default in 2001  where about a quarter of the population was unemployed and levels of destitution and poverty had exceeded 50 per cent — he stated that the multilateral credit institutions needed reform  particularly the International Monetary Fund  as did the political bodies of this honourable Organization.  President Kirchner made five speeches to the General Assembly  and I have made four. This is my fourth statement as President of the Republic. In each of our addresses we have made the same calls to a world that has changed significantly since 2003  when the Argentine Republic was cast as a black sheep gone astray and which found itself in default because of a continued failure to fulfil its obligations. In reality  we were victims  used as guinea pigs in the experiments of the 1990s and neoliberal policies.   25 11-50692   Much has happened since then  when Argentina defaulted on the largest debt — at least  so far — in the history of humanity  $160 billion. Over the past eight years  Argentina has restructured its debt  reducing it from 160 per cent to less than 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The rates of poverty and indigence have been reduced to single digits  and we must continue that fight. Our unemployment rate is among the lowest  and we have completed the most significant cycle of economic growth in our 200 years of history.  Among the emerging countries of our region  Latin America  Argentina has had the leading growth rate and is regularly paying its debt without turning to capital markets. I am not going to list all of the numbers  but they are very compelling. In 2003  we spent 2 per cent of GDP on education and 5 per cent on debt payments. Today  Argentina devotes 6.47 per cent of its GDP to education and spends 2 per cent to debt payment.  The situation in the world is quite different. Many regions and countries have severe problems. Argentina does not pretend to be a model or an example for anyone  but we do wish to reaffirm the need to formulate clear rules with regard to the transfer of capital in the area of financial speculation. Many speakers before me  and doubtless many more to come will do the same  have complained about financial commodity speculation  especially in the food sector.  When we compare the growth of global financial stocks to global GDP — what all of the citizens and businesses of the world produce in goods and services — it becomes clear why we are facing a world where speculation is out of control  careening from one side to the other and from one country or region to another  affecting currencies  economies and the daily lives of citizens  destroying jobs and preventing people from obtaining a dignified education and health care.  If we look at the relationship between global GDP and financial stocks in the 1980s  we see that it was a one-to-one relationship. There was a financial stock that was exactly equal to the goods and services being produced by the world. From the 1990s  figures skyrocketed. In 2008 total financial stocks  total financial activity in the world  reached 3.6 times the global GDP. This meant a tremendous gap between what we produce and what is in what I call the “enter key” economy. I call it that because  if we go looking for these shares  they are mere keystrokes transferring numbers from one place to another  from one currency to another  producing unparalleled market volatility and recurrent crises whereby exchanges go up and down on a daily basis. This not only destroys thousands of jobs but also generates immense profits that someone is pocketing.  We would like to reiterate once again  in the light of our own experience — and I reiterate once again that I do not want to set up a model — the need for multilateral credit organizations to work extremely hard on regulating the global movement of capital and financial speculation. If this does not happen  it will be impossible to achieve that ever elusive market stability  and as a result  the economies of both emerging countries  which have been sustaining the growth of the global economic activity  and developed countries alike will be overwhelmed.  It is crucial that this message be understood  because today we may see speculation on food; yesterday  it was on oil  and tomorrow  it could be on little candies  if that would be profitable and beneficial to the moving of this capital  which gets transferred from one side of the world to the other without any control or regulation whatsoever.  Here I must say that  as a member of the Group of 20 at the London meeting — when it was decided to inject an enormous amount of financial resources into the financial sector that was experiencing problems — I maintained that it was necessary to guarantee that those resources being injected into the financial world could later return to the real economy  the concrete economy  to be able to generate employment  products and services.   Unfortunately  we continue to find ourselves in the same situation  because other than the changes that I would describe as purely cosmetic  we have gone no further with the necessary regulation.  Moreover  the credit ratings agencies — which bear a great deal of the responsibility for much of what has happened — rate Argentina  for example  as a marginal economy. Until very recently  they categorized economies on the brink of default higher than that of Argentina. Therefore  transparent regulation of the ratings agencies is needed  as they bear a great responsibility for the crisis we are currently seeing in various regions — which will  of course  have an impact on all countries.    11-50692 26   It is regrettable that we have been asking for the reform  reorganization and modification of the multilateral credit bodies for so long now. Indeed  we believe that this task should already have been begun  already formulated  in order to avoid precisely what we are experiencing now. For some people it is just a matter of numbers on the stock market  but for others they signal the destruction of the hopes of a lifetime.  As I was saying to a colleague the other day during a visit to Europe  economic crises always end up impacting the political system. There cannot be a serious economic crisis  in which millions of people fall into poverty and lose their jobs  homes  education and health  without that also signalling profound political transformation. And when such political transformation results in further serious economic crises  the result is experiences that I will not go into now. Totalitarianism often came out of crises. The twentieth century produced crises that were not adequately solved by political means.  I call once again for the reform of this important Organization  which represents multilateralism — something we have always consistently defended. We need a more pluralistic and diverse world  and to make political bodies such as the United Nations  and crucially the Security Council  more democratic.  We do not agree on the need to expand the number of permanent members; on the contrary  we believe that the permanent member category should be eliminated. The right to veto also should be eliminated  as it really prevents the Security Council from carrying out the true functions that it had in the bipolar world in which it was originally conceived. At that time  the right to veto was necessary  because in that bipolar world  with the fear of a nuclear holocaust  that right gave to Council members the balance necessary to ensure the security of humankind. Today  that balance is broken. Permanent seats and the right to veto are not about defending security or universal stability; rather  they are often about the position of Council members exercising their right.  In my most recent statement before the Assembly (see A/65/PV.14)  I believe I concluded by expressing my hope that this year Palestine would be become the 194th Member of the concert of the United Nations. My country  Argentina  like most South American nations  has recognized the State of Palestine.   I sincerely believe that blocking the entry of Palestine could perhaps be seen by some as benefiting the State of Israel. But allow me to say to Assembly members  on the authority we have as a country that has suffered from the scourge of international terrorism  that to prevent Palestine from becoming a member of this Assembly means to continue providing alibis to those who engage in international terrorism and who in that repudiation find precisely one of the false arguments they use to justify their crimes.   I believe that the non-inclusion of Palestine this year  far from providing greater security and stability in the world  will bring about greater insecurity and conditions that are utterly unfavourable to what should be the prestige of a body that should represent the interests of all citizens of the world.  For that reason  I ask that God will enlighten those who must make this historic and structural decision of global significance so that greater balance can be achieved and so that this year Palestine will be able to take its seat number 194. I am sure that if we succeed in that endeavour we will help to create a world that is not only safer  but more just.  I would like to make another point  one linked to the situation that we have been describing  with regard to what is shown by the injustice of certain countries — five  to be exact — on the Security Council having veto rights. Once again  we have come to the heart of the United Nations to raise an issue that is just as vital  and not only to Argentines.   The question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands is also a trial by fire for this body in terms of whether it is possible for it to comply with a policy that is essentially multilateral and under which all members are obliged to accept the resolutions of this Assembly.   Ten General Assembly resolutions have invited the United Kingdom and my country to sit down to negotiate and discuss our sovereignty. Bear in mind that Argentina is not asking for those resolutions to be implemented in terms of recognizing sovereignty. No  it is simply asking for compliance with some of the provisions of the 10 United Nations resolutions on the matter.   Perhaps we could also list the 29 resolutions of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee and the 11 resolutions and 8 declarations of the Organization of American States  as well as the   27 11-50692  resolutions of various forums — Ibero-American forums  the Union of South American Nations  the Common Market of the South  meetings of the Arab and African countries — and the entire world. Through such resolutions and declarations  all of them have been demanding that this issue be addressed. The United Kingdom has systematically refused to do so and has obviously used its status as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council to that end.   The year 2013 will mark the passage of 180 years since the Argentines were expelled by force of arms from our Malvinas Islands. Next year will mark 30 years since an incident — which the United Kingdom took advantage of — that was committed by the most terrible dictatorship in memory  of which we Argentines were ourselves victims.   I am proud to be the Government that has set an example for the world in terms of human rights and the prosecution of those responsible for committing crimes and acts of genocide. That is why I believe that focusing on that incident is nothing other than one of the many excuses given to justify non-compliance with United Nations resolutions. What is worse  I ask all of those who see themselves in the mirror of a future world in which natural resources will be necessary  to see how our natural resources  our fisheries and our petroleum resources  are being stolen and illegally seized by those who have no right to do so. Obviously  I do not feel it necessary to emphasize the fact that no one can lay claim to an overseas territory that is more than 14 000 kilometres away. That is clearly an illegal occupation.  Once again  we call upon the United Kingdom to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. Recently  there have been genuine provocations  including missile tests in May and July  which were denounced before the International Maritime Organization  which also suffered one of those attacks. Once again  I reiterate to this Assembly and to the United Kingdom Argentina’s interest in dialogue. It is true that much time has passed  however. We state here  before this Assembly  that we will wait for a reasonable period of time  but if nothing transpires  we will be forced to begin reviewing the provisional understandings that are still in effect. We emphasize in particular that the question of sovereignty must be included in those understandings.   Members may ask what I am referring to here. It is the joint statement and exchange of letters of 14 July 1999 on resuming a regular weekly LAN Chile flight between Punta Arenas and the Malvinas Islands with two monthly stopovers  one in each direction  in Río Gallegos.  Argentina has no intention of exacerbating the situation for any party  but it is also fair that this Assembly and the United Kingdom be aware that there must be compliance with the resolutions. We cannot wait 180 years  or 30 years  just as Palestine cannot be making pilgrimages over the decades to find a place in the world. Still less can the Argentines wait to reclaim the territory that legitimately belongs to us.   I cannot conclude without referring to an issue that has been mentioned in all of the statements that President Kirchner and I have delivered here since 2003. A few moments ago  when I spoke of the question of Palestine  my authority to do so — if indeed it gives us authority  as such — is derived from the fact that we are one of the only two countries in the Americas that have been the target of international terrorism.   This happened on two occasions. In 1992  there was the explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires  and in 1994  there was the blast at the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA)  which is one of the most important mutual associations in Argentina. I stress not that it is a Jewish association  but that it is an Argentine association. This was an attack on Argentina.   I am demanding  on the basis of the requirements of Argentine justice  that the Islamic Republic of Iran submit to the legal authority and in particular allow for those who have been accused of some level of participation in the AMIA attack to be brought to justice.   Last year  we proposed here that if they did not trust our country’s justice system  we could take the approach that was taken for the Lockerbie case: we could choose a court from a third country  by mutual agreement  in order for that court to be able to provide the only thing that we are demanding — that is  justice. We insist on this because it is a universal demand. It does not have to do with political positions. This word  justice  is in the Talmud  the Bible and the Koran  and  for those who do not believe in anything  I am sure it is in their country’s constitution.     11-50692 28   The Government of Argentina received  on 16 July  a message from the Foreign Ministry of Iran stating that it intended to cooperate in initiating a constructive dialogue with Argentina in order to help us get at the truth with respect to the brutal attack against the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association of 18 July 1994. The message that we received from Iran  although signifying a change of attitude on the part of the Government  does not satisfy our demands  which  as I said quite clearly  are for justice.   However  it is an offer of dialogue that Argentina cannot and must not reject. We are here calling for dialogue with the United Kingdom and dialogue among all the parties that make up this body. My country does this on the basis of its commitment to fulfilling its obligation to resolve controversies through peaceful means. This attitude has characterized our country throughout our history. This means that in one sense  Argentina must put aside the requirements arising from our national justice system with respect to prosecuting the presumed perpetrators of these attacks. In another sense  we cannot do this  as this is up to judges and public prosecutors.   What we would like to say  however  is that we think that this dialogue must be constructive. It must be a sincere dialogue and must achieve results in order to be credible and therefore not be understood as just a delay tactic or a distraction.  I will conclude my statement. Sometimes  I think of everything that has happened to Argentines. These things have happened to many countries at various times  but they have all happened to us  in our country  during our history. We have had the worst economic and social disaster in living memory. We still have today a Power exercising a colonial influence in our country. International terrorism has twice made us the target of its attacks. So  if we think of it  it is as if all of the problems and all of the tragedies and miseries of this world decided to focus on one single country.   Our capacity to recover  in terms of the economy  our tireless and never-ending fight to recover what is ours  our never-ending demand for justice for the victims of the attacks  and the strength that we have drawn from all of these tragedies give me the confidence and certainty that this is the path we have chosen: that of achieving growth along with social inclusion for our fellow citizens. It is the path of ensuring that there is unlimited respect for human rights  with trials carried out for the sake of remembrance  truth and justice. It is the path that ensures that today  as the President of all Argentines  I can be accompanied here by family members of victims of the AMIA attack. They have confidence that the Government will continue to do what it has always done  which is to defend the values of truth and justice.   That is what gives me great hope that God will shed light on the path of all those who have to make decisions  not with a view to elections but with a view to the destiny of the world in upcoming decades. That is why I would like to greet everyone today who has taken the floor or who will take the floor and thank the entire Assembly for the support that they have each given  in all of these causes  to my country  the Argentine Republic.  "
"7",267,"ARM",66,2011,"I would first like to thank and wish every success to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to thank Mr. Deiss of Switzerland for his leadership during the sixty-fifth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to once again congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a second term in office.  I would like to acknowledge the importance of the choice of theme for this general debate  and to highlight the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and as a way of preventing the resumption of hostilities.  We greatly appreciate the mediation efforts of global and regional entities and organizations in various parts of the world to preserve peace and security and to settle conflicts through peaceful negotiations. Particularly worth mentioning is the engagement of regional organizations  which have gained a great deal of experience in mediation and have in-depth knowledge of political  cultural and military realities on the ground. The success of mediation hinges  among other things  on the articulation of a clearly defined mandate. A case in point for us has been the role of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in settling the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.  Another key factor worth highlighting here is the role of mediators in preventing the escalation of conflict and a resumption of hostilities. This aspect of mediation is sometimes overlooked  yet it is of no less importance to international peace and stability than is finding a solution to a contentious matter.  Three years ago  when I had the honour to speak from this rostrum (see A/63/PV.9)  I said that the time had come for serious consideration of people’s right to self-determination in the twenty-first century. Today  we are witnessing new instances of people exercising this inalienable right. In that context  I would like to congratulate the newly elected 193rd Member of the United Nations  the Republic of South Sudan. Its road to a seat in this Hall has been long and difficult  but the people of South Sudan  through the free expression of their will  have exercised their right to live as a sovereign  independent nation  thus pursuing the path that many of the Member States represented here today have taken.  The people of Nagorno Karabakh made the same choice two decades ago by exercising their right to   23 11-51185  self-determination  withstanding the war unleashed by Azerbaijan  and surviving bloodshed to earn their right to live in freedom. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict settlement talks are continuing with the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs. We are grateful to the co-chair countries and their leaders for their mediation efforts. However  it is the negotiating parties  not the mediators  who have to reach an agreement. Azerbaijan’s utter unwillingness to reach an agreement and its everything-or-war position have stalled progress in the peace talks. Despite the expectations and high-level advice of the international community  Azerbaijan took yet another step backward during the last meeting in Kazan by rejecting the previously formulated arrangement and in fact trying to make the negotiation process break down.  Baku has turned Armenophobia into State propaganda at a level that is way beyond dangerous. That is not just our view; the alarm has also been sounded by international entities specializing in combating racism and intolerance. Even more dangerously  Armenophobic ideas are spreading among the young Azeri generation  imperilling the future of peaceful coexistence. By denying and destroying all things Armenian  Baku stubbornly continues to disseminate false accusations against Armenia  Nagorno Karabakh and Armenians at all levels everywhere  including here  within the framework of the United Nations. Azerbaijan’s propaganda machine continues to regularly bombard the international community and its domestic audience with horrendous lies about so-called Armenian brutality and the killing of children. These stories are fabricated and disseminated based on their authors’ shallow yet painful logic  which posits that there are some people out there who will rise to the bait of this evil propaganda against Armenia and that it will thus serve a purpose.  In recent years  owing to the efforts of the Minsk Group co-chair countries  particularly direct mediation on the part of the President of the Russian Federation  a number of documents have been signed  including the Meindorf  Astrakhan and Sochi declarations  which have stressed the need to strengthen confidence-building measures between the parties. The signature of the President of Azerbaijan is also on those documents. Azerbaijan  however  continues to turn down repeated proposals from the international community concerning agreement on the non-use of force and the strengthening of confidence-building measures.  Moreover  Azerbaijan’s belligerent rhetoric and threats of war have intensified  and ceasefire violations that continue to deprive innocent civilians of their lives have grown more frequent. All of this is orchestrated at the highest State level. The dangerous rise in manifestations of Armenophobia not only does not contribute to an atmosphere of trust in the region  but also leads to questions about Azerbaijan’s understanding of the United Nations goals of tolerance and good-neighbourly coexistence. With such aspirations  it is impermissible and even dangerous to aspire to membership in the Security Council.  Yesterday  in the framework of the Assembly  alongside debates on some of the most vital and urgent issues of our time  a High-level meeting was convened yesterday on the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration  which reiterated the urgent need to eliminate racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and all forms of intolerance. Unfortunately  these phenomena are familiar to us Armenians not only from the examples I mentioned earlier and not only from this century. As a nation that has survived genocide  the most extreme form of racism and xenophobia  we are morally obliged to act to prevent future genocides.  The elimination of racism and xenophobia and the inculcation of tolerance can be truly effective if accompanied by a clear prescription of liability. Impunity and the avoidance of accountability give birth to yet new crimes. Hence  it is incumbent upon the international community to identify and denounce without delay any expression of intolerance  especially in its extreme forms.  The genocide of the Armenians perpetrated under the Ottoman Empire has been recognized and condemned by numerous countries  parliaments  international organizations and the community of genocide scholars. Unfortunately  the same does not hold true for the Republic of Turkey  which continues to engage in a policy of denying this atrocious crime against humanity.   We unequivocally welcome the clear position adopted by the international community in precluding any possibility of immunity or pardon for the perpetrators of genocide and other crimes against humanity. Without recognition and condemnation  it will be impossible to develop and implement effective    11-51185 24  mechanisms of prevention  which is a United Nations priority. Armenia will contribute its utmost to the recognition  punishment and prevention of genocide.  These references to the Armenian genocide lead me to recall another important celebration marked this year: the 150th birthday of Fridtjof Nansen  the first High Commissioner for Refugees. In the most difficult period for my nation  that great humanist rendered priceless support to the survival of the homeland-deprived fragments of the Armenian people who had fled the genocide. Holders of Nansen passports settled in various countries of the world. They rose to their feet and partook in the development of the countries and peoples that offered them refuge. I believe that justice and equal rights between States have become standards in international relations thanks to such powerful individuals  who promoted their vision of morality in the cruel world of realpolitik.  Speaking from this rostrum in 2008  I expressed the hope that the Armenia-Turkey normalization process initiated by us  the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of the borders closed by Turkey  in violation of international law  would become the first steps towards the launch of a dialogue to overcome the climate of mistrust  suspicion and uncertainty between us. Although our initiative was commended and widely supported by the international community  Turkey has in all ways possible aborted the ratification and implementation of the protocols we signed in 2009.  Today  on the eve of the Rio United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  political will must be exerted to honour the international commitments to convert the South Caucasus into a region of cooperation and prosperity.  The correlation between security and development is not an abstract theory for our region  where economic cooperation and deeper integration with the global economy are hampered by unlawful blockades and the obstruction of regional integration projects. Those attitudes  alongside the fuelling of an arms race  not only pose a danger to the peoples of the region  but also continue to drain the resources direly needed for sustainable development.  The time has come for the leaders of the countries of our region to stand above the dictates of narrow political agendas and to move towards solutions aimed at a peaceful and prosperous future for generations to come. I want to believe that  in the not-too-distant future  our region will be perceived as a solid and firm bridge uniting civilizations  rather than as a dividing line.  Two days ago  the Republic of Armenia celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence. In September 1991  Armenia restored its independence  realizing the dream of the Armenian people and reuniting with the family of nations. In the realm of history  20 years may seem like a short time  but for the current generation it has served as a time of great change  with the building of independent statehood and a renewed perception of its role and place in the world. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all the States  peoples and individuals that have supported us in these 20 years of development and State-building.  Freedom  peace and democracy are our choice  and we are committed to this path. We are proud of our achievements today. In two decades  the Republic of Armenia has implemented a wide-scale programme of State-building. Much has been done in the fields of democratization  the protection of human rights  economic reform  and the establishment of the rule of law and a liberal economy. We have achieved much  but much remains to be done. Above all  we are convinced that we are on the right path — a path that is irreversible.  Exactly a decade ago  New York  the city that is home to the United Nations  experienced one of the worst atrocities in the history of humankind — the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Armenia unconditionally supports and actively contributes to the international community’s counter-terrorism efforts and all the initiatives of the United Nations in this area. We are doing and will continue to do our best to make the world a safer and more peaceful place.  We stand ready  to the best of our abilities  to contribute to global security and respond to global threats  be it through peacekeeping missions  the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters  environmental protection or the fight against terrorism  racism and intolerance. Over the years  we have proven our aspirations and determination with deeds  and we stand ready to continue doing the same."
"8",300,"ATG",66,2011,"Let me at the outset commend Mr. Al-Nasser on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I hereby pledge to him my delegation’s full support for his efforts to successfully move forward the agenda of this session. I wish also to commend his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  for his stewardship.  I would be somewhat remiss if I did not commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership of our treasured Organization. I am pleased to lend my voice to those of other Heads of State and Government who have commended him on his reappointment for a second five-year term beginning 1 January 2012 and to wish him every success in his bold quest to develop an Organization that is both effective and efficient and can bring about meaningful change in the complex world in which we live.  Mr. Al-Nasser’s choice of the theme for the general debate  namely  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  could not have been more timely or appropriate.  Mediation is one of the cornerstones of the Organization. While it is true that mediation should not be the only tool available to the international community to mitigate conflicts  there is nevertheless a growing interest in mediation and its use as a promising and cost-effective tool in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution.  In addition  we  as a community of nations  have on many occasions recognized the useful role that mediation can play in preventing disputes from escalating into conflicts and conflicts from escalating further  as well as in advancing the resolution of conflicts and thus preventing and reducing human suffering and creating conditions conducive to lasting peace and sustainable development  and in this regard  recognizing that peace and development are mutually reinforcing.  In the general debate of the sixty-fifth session  I as well as others called for lasting peace in the Middle East (see A/65/PV.20). I also issued a call for implementation of the two-State solution  which would have Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. Neither of these notions is new; sadly  neither is anywhere close to realization  Given the current state of affairs  it should come as no surprise to anyone that the Palestinian people would seek a different option — full membership in our Organization or  failing that  a vote by the General Assembly that would elevate the status of Palestine from non-voting observer entity to Observer State  a status equal to that of the Holy See.  As we have said in previous debates  we remain fully supportive of the aspirations of the Palestinian people and of the idea of a two-State solution  which would allow the Palestinian people the right to govern themselves and reach their potential in a sovereign and contiguous State. It was against this backdrop that we decided to join with others that have already done so and grant recognition to the State of Palestine. As we did then and do now  we believe that recognition of the State of Palestine will contribute to the quest for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to the creation of lasting peace and stability in the region  and ultimately result in a viable Palestine and a secure Israel  based on the 1967 lines  with mutually agreed swaps to ensure that secure  recognized borders exist for both sides.  Many of today’s conflicts are fuelled by the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons. Those small weapons of mass destruction have had a devastating impact on the countries of our region over the past decade  and have been directly implicated in the associated rise in crime and violence involving the use of firearms. Needless to say  those weapons have had a significant adverse impact on security and socio-economic and human development in our countries.  In their 2007 annual reports  both the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World Bank identified our region as having higher murder rates than any other region in the world. They also stated that small arms and light weapons were used in more than 70 per cent of those murders. We never sought that dubious designation  which was anything but welcome.  This is why  at our most recent summit in July 2011  my fellow Heads of State of the Caribbean Community adopted a Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons in which  inter alia  we agreed   “to accord the highest national and regional priority to matters related to combating and   37 11-51360  eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition” [and] “to intensify and sustain engagement in the United Nations effort for the conclusion of a legally binding Arms Trade Treaty”. I call on all States Members of our Organization to join our region in this worthy endeavour.   The very existence of many developing countries as viable States is at stake. The world financial and economic crisis continues to threaten debt sustainability in our countries through its impact on the real economy and the increase in borrowing we had to undertake in order to mitigate the negative impacts of the crisis.  The recent gyrations in the major stock markets of the world do not inspire hope for lasting global economic recovery any time soon. Now more than ever  if we are to overcome the current crisis we need a new mechanism for restructuring and resolving sovereign debt that takes into account the multiple dimensions of debt sustainability.   This seemingly unending economic crisis has affected our countries not only in economic terms  but also through the presence of barriers to trade  as well as the financing embedded in some of the anti-crisis measures adopted by some developed countries. More importantly  the crisis has impacted our social development  which in turn has led and continues to lead to a major loss of jobs and difficulties in financing social programmes that address poverty or the provision of basic amenities. All those factors threaten our efforts to attain the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals.  While my country has made good progress with the United States on our online gaming dispute  we urge the United States to remain committed to reaching a mutually agreed outcome that will bring value to our economy and is implementable by the United States.  With so much at stake  we will soldier on in our quest to seek market access openings in key sectors and other innovative incentives that could include but would not be limited to financial and technical support  forensics  equipment and training for dealing with drug trafficking and for the creation of decent jobs for the people of Antigua and Barbuda.  Mine is not the only country in the Caribbean that has experienced trade-related difficulties with the United States. A far more pernicious economic  commercial and financial blockade has been imposed by the United States of America on Cuba  and although the overwhelming majority of membership of the United Nations has repeatedly called for that blockade to be lifted  it continues unabated. As a country committed to the norms of the multilateral trading system and the freedom of trade and navigation  and as a nation that rejects the extraterritorial application of another country’s national law  we call on the United States to immediately and unconditionally lift its economic blockade against the people of Cuba.  On 19 September  almost 11 years to the day since the World Health Assembly endorsed the landmark Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases to reduce the toll of premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  the General Assembly adopted a Political Declaration (resolution 66/2) that  among other things  calls for the launch of a global NCD campaign.  While there is much to be lauded in the Declaration  we are nevertheless disappointed that some of our original expectations  including a clear goal for the launching of the global NCD campaign with a corresponding road map  may not have been fully developed. However  we believe that  if rigorously implemented  the Declaration will contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Let it be known that we will do our utmost to ensure that the momentum generated at that meeting is not lost.  Two days ago  we held a one day High-level Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action — the internationally recognized blueprint for action to fight racism that was adopted by consensus at the 2001 World Conference against Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  held in Durban  South Africa. To this day  the Declaration remains an innovative and action-oriented agenda to combat all forms of racism and racial discrimination.  This tenth anniversary is a chance to strengthen political commitment to fighting racism and racial discrimination. It is also an opportune time to revisit    11-51360 38  the issue of reparations for slavery  which is central to any discussion about racism  colonialism and poverty. Antigua and Barbuda has long argued that the legacy of slavery  segregation and racial violence against peoples of African descent has severely impaired our advancement as nations  communities and individuals across the economic  social and political spectrums. In obtaining redress for the injustices suffered by African slaves and their descendants  today’s Caribbean and African peoples would advance immeasurably the process of genuine healing.  Those who choose to differ have argued that  unlike victims of the Holocaust or those who have been interned during wars and have subsequently received remunerations  neither the victims nor the perpetrators of slavery are alive today  and that it is unfair to hold the descendants of slave-owners responsible for the actions of their ancestors.  On this we strongly disagree. However  no one should disagree that racism and other legacies of slavery continue to shape the lives of people of African descent. Thus  reparations must be directed towards repairing the damage inflicted by slavery and racism. That is why we call on former slave States to begin the reconciliation process by issuing formal apologies for the crimes committed by those nations or their citizens over the 400 years of the African slave trade. To help counter the lingering damage inflicted on generations of peoples of African descent by generations of slave trading and colonialism  we call on those very States to back up their apologies with new commitments to the economic development of the nations that have suffered from that human tragedy.  The United Nations has declared 2011 to be the International Year for People of African Descent. Throughout the year  nations and communities of the African diaspora have undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at the realization of the full enjoyment of economic  cultural  social  civil and political rights; participation and integration in all political  economic  social and cultural aspects of society; the promotion of a greater knowledge of and respect for their diverse heritage and culture  with pronounced emphasis on encouraging multilateralism and development approaches; and the creation of a global Afro-centric movement.  The time has come for peoples of the African diaspora to begin helping themselves. A key part of that process is the first African Diaspora Summit  to be held in South Africa in mid-2012. The Summit and its preparatory process will provide a platform for the African diaspora to put in place economic policies aimed at ensuring sustained economic cooperation among public and private stakeholders  so as to promote development  entrepreneurship and business opportunities in diasporan regions.  By 31 October  our planet will reach a milestone of sorts. Somewhere on the Earth’s surface  the planet’s 7-billionth inhabitant will be born. Seven billion people! If nothing else  that milestone will serve to reaffirm our determination as the international community to implement sound development policies and promote the inherent right and dignity of each person. Coming amid the preparations for the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro  a world of 7 billion inhabitants reminds us of the critical need to pay attention to population dynamics if we are to understand the needs of our people  proactively plan to avoid development pitfalls  and develop forward-looking policies that promote the health and dignity of every human being on Earth  while at the same time safeguarding the planet we call our home.  By making the necessary investments to develop quality human capital  with equally strong measures to promote gender equality with the active promotion of women and youth participation in all spheres of life  we will create the enabling conditions for transforming the economies of developing countries in order to eradicate poverty and achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals. Policies responsive to the needs of our population not only contribute to dynamic  growing economies but are a prerequisite for addressing the huge challenges related to access to food  energy  water and sanitation  climate change  fast-paced urbanization and migration. It is not enough to merely respond to anticipated challenges; we must take innovative and proactive approaches to seize the opportunities presented by a world of 7 billion people.  As the countries of Latin American and Caribbean region reflect on and respond to those global challenges  we have determined that our own destinies are interwoven and that  as developing countries  we must unite and coordinate our efforts in a systematic  structured and deliberative way. We have done just that   39 11-51360  with the creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Antigua and Barbuda fully endorses and supports the objectives and ideals of the Community and wishes to acknowledge the efforts of countries such as Mexico  Venezuela  Brazil  Cuba and our sister CARICOM member States for bringing the organization into being.  As we prepare for an important Summit in Caracas  Venezuela  in December  we intend to lay the foundation of a dynamic  responsive and meaningful community of nations that share a common history and that have a great deal to gain in our coming together in this way to reshape the agenda  thereby creating a greater balance in the pursuit of happiness  prosperity  peace and democracy in our hemisphere.  Within my own subregion  the eight small developing countries that make up the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) have a common currency union  the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). We have been adversely affected by the global financial and economic crisis and we are faced with a protracted recovery. The impact of the global crisis was manifested in steep declines in our tourist arrivals and expenditures  direct foreign investment and remittances. Our real gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 5.7 per cent in 2009 and is estimated to have declined by a further 2.2 per cent in 2010  influenced by declines in value added in construction  manufacturing  agriculture  wholesale and retail  transport and financial intermediation. The crisis has also had a marked impact on our fiscal positions  with an accompanying increase in public-sector debt.  Despite those challenges  there is a positive side. Our countries have strong liberal democratic systems and the rule of law is upheld. We also have a stable currency that has been pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of 2.7 Eastern Caribbean dollars to $1 since 1976. That has been responsible for comparatively low inflation and confidence in the monetary system. In response to the global and regional economic and financial crises  ECCU members have crafted a very strong response to those challenges. We have upgraded our current economic integration arrangements to an economic union status and a new treaty to that effect  the revised Treaty of Basseterre establishing an OECS Economic Union  was ratified in January 2011.  We have put in place a number of institutional arrangements  which have served us well in addressing the effects of the crisis over the past two years. We adopted the ECCU Eight Point Stabilisation and Growth Programme in 2009  aimed at stabilizing and transforming the ECCU economies. As part of the financial programming  we have set fiscal targets  which have been approved by the Monetary Council and published. The targets are intended to move our countries on a path towards achieving a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2020.  My region remains deeply concerned that AIDS has claimed 30 million lives and orphaned 16 million children since it was first discovered in 1981. My region remains committed to intensifying national efforts to create enabling legal  social and policy frameworks to eliminate stigma  discrimination and violence related to HIV and to promote non-discriminatory access to HIV prevention  treatment  care and support.  As a small developing nation  we can easily identify with the President’s call for enhancing South-South and triangular cooperation. This  after all  was perhaps his signature issue during his tenure as Chairman of the Committee on South-South Cooperation. His choice of improving disaster prevention and response also resonates with us. The increase in the frequency and intensity of natural and man-made disasters and the devastation wrought by them on vulnerable countries such as my own leave us with no choice but to develop ways to build our capacities so that we are better prepared to withstand these disasters.  In addition to his main theme for this session  we also support the President’s call to focus on United Nations reform and revitalization so as to ensure that our Organization remains relevant  efficient and effective and is able to adapt to meeting the ever-changing global challenges.  His fourth focal area of sustainable development and global prosperity is perhaps the one with the most scope for collective action. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012 will certainly provide a forum for the international community to  among other things  recommit to sustainable development  the eradication of poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals by ensuring the balance among the economic  social and    11-51360 40  environmental aspects of sustainable development  with the human being at the centre of our efforts.   We can no longer ask whether we can  but we need to give an account of exactly how we will meet the enormous political  economic  humanitarian and environmental challenges our planet faces. The global economic crisis continues to shake the pillars of our economic system: banks  businesses  Governments  private sectors and even our own families. Now more than ever  we need a more efficient  effective and focused United Nations that is both transparent and accountable to help us address the extraordinary array of geopolitical and humanitarian challenges: famine in Somalia  the continued crisis in Haiti  the aftershocks of the Arab Spring  ongoing conflicts in some countries and difficult transitions in others  in addition to the deeper political  economic and environmental transformations that are reshaping our world.  In an increasingly uncertain world  the world’s people are looking to us here  in this great Hall of the United Nations  for answers. We are their best hope for building a safe  secure and just world. We cannot afford to disappoint. We know that rescuing the planet will require us to invest in people  particularly women and youth. It will require us to re-emphasize the prevention of conflicts and natural disasters alike  and it will require us to devote new efforts to assist nations in transition from war to peace  autocracy to democracy  poverty to prosperity.  Let us show the people of the world that we are indeed up to these enormous tasks. Then  and only then  will we be able to say: “Yes  we did!”"
"9",347,"AUS",66,2011,"Since we last gathered in this great Assembly one year ago  we have witnessed developments of historic dimensions. There has been democratic protest and democratic reform across the Arab world  as we discovered afresh that freedom is the right of all  not just of the few. Also  a global economic crisis is rolling on  as we enter a new and dangerous period that threatens the jobs and livelihoods of working people everywhere.  And while rarely making the front pages  the other great global challenges that have been with us now for too many years continue their almost alarmingly silent advance — challenges of grinding poverty  environmental degradation  the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons  the enhancement of human rights  all of which compete for attention on an already crowded international agenda.  Our global institutions are struggling to comprehend  let alone effectively respond to  this vast array of challenges that now confront us — challenges that arise as the inevitable consequence of what we now simply call globalization. Put simply  the dilemma is this: the challenges we face are increasingly global while the institutions at our disposal are still primarily national. Or put more crudely  for those engaged in democratic politics  the answers may lie abroad  but all the votes lie at home.  Three years ago  when I first spoke at this podium  I spoke of the storm clouds gathering across the global economy. It seemed as if we were in free fall as we all stared into the abyss  with the very real possibility of a second global depression in a century. Through coordinated intervention in 2009  we broke the fall. Yet three years on  the crisis in the global economy continues  still with a capacity to engulf us all. Recovery is stalling. Unemployment is rising. Confidence is waning. There are growing concerns over sovereign debt levels  and there are concerns also over the national and international political will to deal with these challenges.  This week  the International Monetary Fund issued a stark warning for the global economy  highlighting that we have entered a new and dangerous phase. So what then is to be done?   First  reforms to the financial system should be implemented and taxpayers should no longer be asked to bail out the irresponsible behaviour of particular financial institutions. Secondly  all major economies need to find a credible path back to surplus over time  consistent with the Group of Twenty’s Framework for Strong  Sustainable and Balanced Growth. Thirdly  we    11-51179 2  must prevent a further outbreak of protectionism and we must conclude Doha  as history will condemn us if we repeat the job-destroying protectionism of the 1930s that transformed a financial crisis into a full-blown depression.  Fourthly  for international trade to grow and Chinese domestic demand to make a greater contribution to growth in economies around the world  we must also see currency reform  particularly with the appreciation of the Chinese yuan. And finally  we must with clarity of leadership and resolution of purpose define and deliver a range of other new innovative drivers of global growth. These include innovative public-private financing for the new infrastructure revolution needed for power  water  agriculture  transport and communications. The jobs potential for the green energy revolution must be fully harvested by carbon pricing  and women and youth must participate fully in the economies of the developed and the developing world.   These are not just useful social policies. These are not just useful environmental policies. They are now necessary economic policies to generate the next missing increment of global economic growth. What is required  therefore  is global and national political leadership capable of looking beyond the next electoral cycle — to look to the long term over the short term  to look to the strategic rather than the tactical  and to look to the necessary over the urgent.  Over the course of the last decade  we have seen an acceleration of the shift of economic power to Asia marking Asia’s re-emergence as the centre of global economic gravity after an interruption of more than 200 years. In the year 2000  China was a mere 3.7 per cent of global GDP and India was less than half that. By 2030  they will account for more than 20 per cent of global GDP  and that will rise further. Asian countries held 16.6 per cent of global foreign exchange reserves in 2001. Now they hold 39 per cent.   Therefore  what happens in Asia is now of fundamental relevance to the world  not just to the region itself. Asian economic growth has been overwhelmingly good for the global economy.   But Asia has also seen an exponential increase in military expenditure. Over the last 20 years military expenditure in East Asia grew by nearly 150 per cent. During the same period the United States’ military expenditure grew by 36 per cent. Asia  with its many unresolved territorial disputes and military tensions  has become the new global arms bazaar.  One of the big spenders  despite the poverty afflicting its population  is North Korea. North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme and its long-range missile programme represent a direct threat to the security of our region  including Australia.  To deal adequately with those and other security challenges in Asia  we need strong regional institutional architecture  as a complement to the United Nations  to help build transparency  cooperation and  in time  a sense of common security in our region.  For that reason  Australia has promoted the concept of an Asia-Pacific community. Collectively  regional countries now have an opportunity to realize the idea of such a community through the expanded East Asia Summit (EAS)  which for the first time this year will include the Presidents of the United States and of the Russian Federation. Over time  a stronger EAS can promote the type of rules-based order regionally for which the United Nations strives globally. This task is critical to avoid damaging strategic miscalculation in the Asia-Pacific region  which would also undermine global economic growth.   I say again: what happens in Asia now matters not just for Asia  itself  but for the world.  In Australia’s more immediate region in the South Pacific  we are bound together by the common bonds of democracy and the responsibility we all have to develop those economies and protect their natural environment.  We thank the Secretary-General for his visit to the Pacific Islands Forum — the first ever by a United Nations Secretary-General. His commitment to our region is an important signal of the international community’s interests in the Pacific’s prosperity  its sustainability and its democracy.  Global events since the last session of the General Assembly have highlighted that the human cry for freedom and for democracy is both indivisible and universal. Australia stands with the rest of the international community in applauding the courage of those citizens seeking what is naturally theirs in Tunisia  in Egypt  in Libya  and now in Syria.  In Egypt  we are now supporting improved dry land farming and assistance with urban employment   3 11-51179  programmes as Egypt moves to critical parliamentary and presidential elections. In Tunisia  we are providing agricultural and electoral assistance. In Libya  Australia was among the first to campaign internationally for a no-fly zone to protect civilians at a time when Al-Qadhafi seemed destined for victory. We are proud of the fact that since the Libya conflict began  Australia stands across the world as the third largest humanitarian donor to the long-suffering people of Libya. We also stand ready to assist with institution-building in the new Libya of the future.  What challenges us now is the ongoing brutality in Syria. The Syrian regime should heed the lessons of Libya. We call on Bashar Al-Assad to step down now  for political reform to begin now  and for the international community to intensify its pressure on Damascus to respond to the voices of the Syrian people demanding their legitimate freedom.  Twelve months ago  we had no expectation of change in Egypt  Tunisia or Libya. But we did hope to see progress in the historic process to bring permanent peace to the peoples of Israel and Palestine. Sadly  there has been no progress. Australia remains committed to a negotiated two-State solution that allows a secure and independent Israel to live side by side with a secure and independent Palestinian State.  Over the past 10 months I have travelled three times to both Jerusalem and Ramallah  where I have met on each occasion with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. I have urged both parties to engage in direct negotiations. I have argued that they should be held on the basis of the 1967 boundaries plus appropriate land swaps. I have argued that the remaining final status issues — the right to return  the status of Jerusalem  the Holy Sites and the provision of external security — be resolved through such direct negotiations.  My fear is that if we do not see these matters concluded in the near term  the rapidly changing geo-politics of the region will make the prospects of a lasting settlement remote. We have already seen tension between Israel and Egypt. We have already seen the fracturing of the relationship between Israel and Turkey. We do not know how long the current framework of the Arab Peace Plan will remain on the table. We are fearful of a further intifada of the type we have seen before.  As a friend of Israel  we are fearful that in the absence of a negotiated settlement  Israel’s security situation will deteriorate rapidly in the year ahead. As a friend of the Palestinian people  we believe that the time has come for direct negotiations to establish a Palestinian State  one which also guarantees the security of Israel. If we fail to achieve this  I fear the gravity of the consequences as the ground continues to change across the wider Middle East. I note also that these views have been reflected today by the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.   Australia therefore urges both parties to seize the day and to shape the future of a new Middle East. We await the outcome from the weeks that lie ahead in New York  before framing our response to any particular resolution before the United Nations.  Terrorism is the enemy of all civilized peoples. A decade since 9/11  terrorism still casts a deep shadow over the security and safety of our citizens. Many of Australia’s finest have lost their lives in the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan. Australia will stay the course in Afghanistan  because we refuse to yield to terrorism.  While terrorism threatens thousands  nuclear proliferation threatens millions. Australia remains vitally committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world and is active to that end. That is why we have established with Japan the Non-proliferation and Disarmament Initiative — the NPDI — to take forward the agenda of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.   As we speak in this Assembly  we should remind ourselves that a fifth of humanity lives in grinding poverty. The scale of the challenge has been graphically demonstrated by this year’s devastating drought in the Horn of Africa. I witnessed how bad things are when I visited the affected areas in July. Australia has given almost US$ 100 million. We are proud to be the fourth largest international donor to that crisis. We will continue to give.  Last year  we gathered to see how we were tracking on our collective pledge to lift a billion people out of poverty by 2015. The report card was very poor. Most of the Millennium Development Goals are unlikely to be achieved. Australia has doubled its official development assistance (ODA) budget over the past five years  and we are on track to double it again    11-51179 4  by 2015. Based on available data  that would make Australia’s ODA budget the sixth largest in the world.  The international community must get behind both regional and global efforts to meet the strategic need for food security. With a forecast global population of 9.3 billion by 2050  an estimated increase of 70 per cent in global food production will be needed to feed the world.   In food security  we should also be blunt. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is failing fully to meet its mandate to the poor of the world. Under its new management  FAO needs to set clear priorities for the future and eliminate the unsustainable administrative overheads it has long tolerated. If FAO does not do so  Australia will comprehensively review its development funding for FAO under our new aid effectiveness criteria.   Food is fundamental to development. So too is the right to education. All of the world’s children must be given a chance at life that is good for them and good for their economies. For that reason  and learning from both the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria and the GAVI Alliance  Australia believes that the time has come for the international community to consider developing a new public-private institution with an explicit mandate for school education.  At present  this task is shared between the World Bank  UNICEF and UNESCO  with negligible private sector buy-in. We should consider  therefore  a new global fund for education that would concentrate exclusively on the immediate task of getting nearly 70 million children into schools by 2015. Australia would consider contributing substantially to such an institution to bring about real results at a rate as rapid as possible. I challenge education donors  current and potential  to join such a fund.  In supporting the world’s most vulnerable peoples  we also recognize the world’s estimated 370 million indigenous peoples  spread across 90 of the 193 United Nations Member States. They remain among the most marginalized and disadvantaged in the world  including in our country  Australia. That is why the Australian Government has reached beyond the apology to the Stolen Generations to pursue constitutional recognition for our First Peoples. And we are committed to closing the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.  Our hope of answering the development challenges of the world is inextricably linked to the health of the planet itself. The planet ultimately can bear only so much. Scientists tell us that there are planetary boundaries beyond which we should not venture — in climate change  biodiversity loss  stratospheric ozone depletion  chemical pollution  ocean acidification and the depletion of freshwater reserves. It is not just a matter of atmospheric limits  but of the oceans as well.  Next year at Rio the international community will have the opportunity to act decisively to protect a planet now in stress  just as we need to take effective global action on climate change. Climate change will not go away  even if some choose the easy path of simply hiding their heads in the sand. If we do that  our children and theirs will never forgive us — nor should they.  As the global community  we face challenges of historic consequence — to our global economy  to global security  to the basic freedoms of all peoples  to our global environment  to the security of our citizens  to our obligation to the world’s poor and to our planetary boundaries themselves.  While so many challenges lie before us  the past year has proven that when the international community does act collectively and decisively  we can deliver — as we have seen in the decisions of the Security Council on Libya and Côte d’Ivoire. But to be effective  this parliament of humankind  these United Nations  must continue to summon the political will of Member States to make our global institutions work. Otherwise  we will become a clanging gong  full of sound and sentiment  but ultimately symbolizing nothing.  When Secretary-General Ban came to Australia two weeks ago  he saw a country that values the rules-based system that the United Nations embodies. Australia today is a middle Power with global interests  animated by deep values of freedom and a fair go for all. This is the Australia we are proud of in its work in the world. This is the Australia that believes in the principles of good international citizenship. This is the Australia that rolls up its sleeves  the Australia that by nature wants to pitch in  the Australia that wants to make a difference for the betterment of all humankind."
"10",394,"AUT",66,2011,"This year has once again confirmed the importance of the United Nations as the truly indispensable multilateral forum for addressing today’s global problems. The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa  ecological disasters such as Fukushima  political developments like the Arab Spring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the United Nations building in Abuja last August require concerted action by the United Nations and its Member States. Ten years after 9/11  joint action in the fight against terrorism continues to remain central on the multilateral agenda.  In the past nine months  we have witnessed momentous changes in the Arab world that nobody expected when we met one year ago. Pressure for change is driven by the wish of women and men to choose their own fate and to improve their chances for a better life. These are legitimate demands. An overwhelming number of young people were at the forefront of this enormous tide  which started in Tunisia and Egypt. We should pay tribute to their courage.  In Libya  thousands lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and democracy. In Syria  and to some extent in Yemen  the suppression is ongoing. Austria strongly condemns the systematic human rights violations and the violence against peaceful demonstrators. We strongly urge those responsible to immediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in meaningful dialogue and reforms. Austria supports the Libyan people in its struggle for freedom. Over €150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has been de-frozen for humanitarian use. Both the Austrian Government and private sector have provided medicine  relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to Libya.  The international community and the United Nations have to support and assist the transition process in the Arab world as the United Nations does now in Libya. This period of change may last for some time and will be full of challenges. Austria welcomes all efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for peaceful and credible change. We encourage the newly empowered authorities to create a constitutional framework based on democracy and human rights  in order to fulfil their mandate for democratic change responsibly and peacefully.  The events in the Arab world notwithstanding  we must continue to focus on the Middle East peace process. The Middle East took centre stage this week here at the General Assembly — and rightly so. We must build trust and we have to foster the belief among Israelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement can be achieved — a sustainable solution based on two States living side by side in a secure and peaceful neighbourhood within mutually recognized borders. We have no choice but to return to direct negotiations between the two parties. The Quartet  in its statement yesterday  has shown a way to do that and has also proposed concrete timelines. Austria fully supports the Quartet statement. There is no time to lose.    11-51372 26   Austria welcomes President Al-Nasser’s choice of theme for this year’s general debate. We appreciate Qatar’s strong track record in that regard.   Last year’s tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security reminded us that the promise of women’s full and equal participation in all efforts of maintaining peace and security  including in mediation processes  has not yet come true and that we all need to intensify our efforts.  In that context  let me also mention an Austrian contribution to international mediation efforts. By inviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum and Juba to Vienna in recent years  Austria has managed to offer the two sides a platform for discussion. We are ready to continue to do so. The Sudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must resolve their remaining problems peacefully.  The United Nations headquarters in Vienna serves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace  security and sustainable development. I am proud to announce that a liaison office of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soon. Over the past year  the International Anti-Corruption Academy set up its headquarters near Vienna  and the Vienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and an office of the International Peace Institute were established.  Austria fully stands behind the campaign launched by the Secretary-General on Monday to achieve universal access to modern energy services. We support doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Austria provides substantial support to the energy and environment efforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Last June  we hosted the Vienna Energy Forum  where about 1 400 participants discussed alternative energy concepts to reach the energy goals of the United Nations.  The Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should become a turning point in our approach to nuclear safety. We owe it to future generations to make safety concerns come first when using nuclear power. Austria decided  in 1978  to forgo the use of nuclear energy. Some countries have recently adopted a similar course  which we welcome.  The last time I spoke at the United Nations  it was during the thematic debate held in April on the rule of law and global challenges. That was an important step in the preparation of the high-level meeting on the rule of law that will take place in September 2012. Next year’s meeting will provide an important opportunity to renew the efforts of both the United Nations and Member States to promote the rule of law. As a medium-sized country and as a strong supporter of multilateralism  Austria attaches particular importance to the rule of law  including at the international level. The international system can only properly function if it based on clear and predictable rules that apply equally to all Member States.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core priority of Austria’s foreign policy. We are proud to serve on the Human Rights Council for the period 2011-2014. For our membership in this body  Austria has identified the following priorities  on which we will take action.  Austria is firmly committed to respect for freedom of religion and belief. We are deeply troubled by recurring attacks against religious minorities in all parts of the world and among all religions. To foster tolerance  Austria has hosted a number of high-level dialogues between religious and secular leaders over the past decade. We think that that has become a new and promising field of modern diplomacy  putting the emphasis on conflict prevention.  Various forms of child trafficking and exploitation constitute gross violations of children’s rights. As a member of the Human Rights Council  Austria will work to address that issue and to help develop counter-strategies. We highly appreciate the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict  Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy  and we strongly support the renewal of her mandate.  Racism  xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin  gender  age  sexual orientation and religious belief are ongoing challenges and of concern to all of us. Austria is committed to the fight against those abuses  including anti-Semitism. Therefore  we will continue to press for action  including in the framework of the United Nations. We will also take initiatives during our membership in the Human Rights Council to strengthen the protection of journalists against all forms of threat and intimidation.   27 11-51372   Austria has a 50-year-long track record of contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations. And we will continue our engagement. We recently decided to deploy 160 Austrian troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  in addition to our continued presence in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. Through its participation in UNIFIL  Austria wishes to make an active contribution to the maintenance of peace and security not only in Lebanon but in the region as a whole.  Austria welcomes the positive momentum in international security policy over the past couple of years. We salute the Secretary-General’s determined leadership  including his five-point plan on disarmament. We look forward to continuing our work in this positive spirit at the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in Vienna in May of next year. We  and hope for progress with regard to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Nevertheless  despite our collective efforts  we have not been able to move forward on new   disarmament and arms control issues. The multilateral machinery  and in particular the Conference on Disarmament  remains deadlocked. Unfortunately  the momentum that we had hoped to generate over the past year has not materialized. Therefore  in Austria’s view  the Conference on Disarmament has not only lost its credibility  it is also risking its legitimacy. Austria will therefore encourage the adoption of a draft resolution  at the next session of the First Committee  on how to move multilateral disarmament negotiations forward.  Austria remains committed to multilateralism and to the United Nations as the noblest form of international cooperation. We will therefore support the efforts of the President and the Secretary-General to further strengthen the Organization in order to better enable us to face the challenges of our time."
"11",419,"AZE",66,2011,"I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of General Assembly at the sixty-sixth session  and wish you every success in that highly responsible post. I thank your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his productive work during the last session.  I also express my profound respect and gratitude to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership and dedication to revitalizing the United Nations Organization.  With regard to the theme of this year’s general debate  we welcome the adoption at the sixty-fifth session of resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution. In that document  the General Assembly reiterated that all Member States should strictly adhere to their obligations  as laid down in the United Nations Charter  and reaffirmed  inter alia  the commitment to respect the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States.  Azerbaijan looks forward to the relevant guidance for more effective mediation  as indicated in the resolution  and we are ready to actively contribute to its elaboration. Unfortunately  we have to admit that   29 11-51670  not all States approach their international obligations responsibly and comply with the generally accepted norms and principles of international law.  For almost two decades  we have witnessed the flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and other documents of international law by the Republic of Armenia  which has perpetrated aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. As a result of that aggression  almost 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan remains under occupation and about 1 million Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons are unable to return to their homes.  In 1993  the Security Council adopted four resolutions (resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993) 874 (1993) and 884 (1993)) demanding the immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and reaffirmed the sovereignty  territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan. The same appeals were made also by other international organizations. Unfortunately  Armenia continues to ignore the calls of the international community.  What is even more worrisome is that  instead of preparing its people for a peaceful  prosperous and stable future in friendship and cooperation with the neighbouring countries  the leadership of Armenia continues to publicly incite the future generations to new wars  violence and aggression and to propagate  by all means  the dangerous ideas of animosity and hatred towards not only Azerbaijan  but also other peoples of the region.  Illegal activities in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan  including the implantation of ethnic Armenian settlers  as well as the destruction and appropriation of historical and cultural heritage  represent another source of serious concern. Such activities serve to further consolidate the current status quo of the occupation  securing the results of ethnic cleansing and colonization of the seized lands  as well as to seriously hamper the prospects for conflict resolution. Earlier in this Hall  we heard a very aggressive and unconstructive statement by the President of Armenia. He openly confirmed that destructive policy of Armenia. (see )  The Field Assessment Mission conducted by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in October 2010 to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan  stated  inter alia  that the status quo of the occupation was unacceptable and urged Armenia to put an end to its illegal practices in those territories.   As a country suffering from the occupation of its territories and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of its citizens  Azerbaijan is the most interested party in the earliest negotiated settlement of the conflict. Our position is well known to the international community. It is based on strict adherence to the norms and principles of international law  according to which the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible and must be rejected resolutely and unconditionally.  It is absolutely illogical that the leadership of Armenia  which has implemented the total ethnic cleansing of not only the occupied territories of Azerbaijan  but also of the Azerbaijani population in its own territory  is trying to apply the principle of self-determination. It is obvious that one cannot expel peoples from their homes on ethnic grounds and  at the same time  speak about self-determination for those who remain on the same grounds.  Azerbaijan recognizes that the right of peoples to self-determination can be implemented only   “at all times in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the relevant norms of international law  including those relating to territorial integrity of States”   as enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act.  Azerbaijan is confident that the conflict resolution must start with the withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from the occupied territories  within the fixed timetable  followed by the restoration of communications  the return of refugees and internally displaced persons  and the creation of conditions for the peaceful coexistence of Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the Nagorno Karabakh region within the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. That step-by-step approach  which has been proposed by mediators and supported by the international community  except  unfortunately  the leadership of Armenia  can bring durable peace  stability and predictability to the region.  Azerbaijan still maintains its interest  motivation and patience in that very hard and sensitive process of    11-51670 30  negotiations. We believe that the international community will convince the Armenian side to respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and cease abusing the right of Azerbaijanis to live within their own territories  including the Nagorno Karabakh region. In return  we are ready to guarantee the highest level of self-rule for that region within the Republic of Azerbaijan.  I would like to touch upon another important issue of the international agenda — Palestine. Azerbaijan reaffirms its adherence to the position expressed by the majority of the United Nations Member States. We reiterate our long-standing solidarity with the people and leadership of Palestine  and believe that the time has come to reach a breakthrough in that long-standing and very important issue. The time has come for Palestine to be fully represented at the United Nations.  Azerbaijan is determined to contribute further to the realization of the development goals and objectives agreed within the United Nations. In recent years  Azerbaijan has enhanced its humanitarian assistance to support international and national efforts aimed at eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development and global prosperity for all. We pay particular attention to addressing the special needs and vulnerabilities of developing and least developed countries  as well as those recovering from natural disasters and suffering from climate change  in particular small island States.  The recent humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa once again demonstrated the importance of global solidarity. Azerbaijan has provided urgent aid to support the ongoing efforts towards the eradication of famine in that region. The Government of Azerbaijan is currently considering additional funding to support the international community in ramping up its efforts to respond to the humanitarian situation and contribute to a mid- and long-term sustainable solution to the crisis in the Horn of Africa.  Proceeding from the fruitful cooperation between the United Nations and the Government of Azerbaijan  resolution 64/186  entitled “Building connectivity through the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway”  initiated by Azerbaijan  was adopted at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly on 21 December 2009. As the main coordinator of the project  Azerbaijan has conducted a feasibility study and is financing the Secretariat of the project. We have taken a number of steps towards the establishment of a consortium  comprising of major telecommunications operators in the region.  Azerbaijan has always been a place of coexistence and tolerance among various faiths  ethnic groups and philosophies. It is one of the unique places where different cultures and civilizations meet at the crossroads between East and West and North and South.  As a bridge between cultures and an active member of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations  Azerbaijan feels responsible for promoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue based on mutual respect and understanding. Thus  over the past years  we hosted a number of high-profile and action-oriented events  including the Summit of World Religious Leaders in April 2010  the World Forum for Intercultural Dialogue from 7 to 9 April 2011 and other similar events.  Desiring to contribute further to the maintenance of international peace  security  stability and prosperity  Azerbaijan has put forward its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term of 2012-2013. The elections will be held this year on 21 October at the General Assembly.  The year 2012 marks the twentieth anniversary of Azerbaijan’s membership in the United Nations  although  unlike other candidates from the Group of Eastern European States  we have never had an opportunity to become a member of the Security Council. Azerbaijan’s election to the Security Council would contribute to redressing the underrepresentation of small developing States and bring a more balanced membership to that United Nations organ. The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan would highly appreciate the valuable support of the States Members of the United Nations for its candidature for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council."
"12",465,"BDI",66,2011,"I should like  first of all  to associate myself with previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and the members of the Bureau for their election. We would also like to thank the President of the sixty-fifth session for his work in presiding over the Assembly last year.  We also take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations. That reappointment is vivid testimony of his successes in contributing to the promotion of international peace and security  human rights and sustainable development.  The process of consolidating peace in Burundi  with the support of the United Nations  led to the successful organization of the 2010 elections through a process of consensus and thanks to an electoral code that was published following consultations with all stakeholders. That spirit of dialogue in the process of consolidating peace  also allowed our parliament to establish an ombudsman position and an independent National Human Rights Commission. This same process has allowed us to develop a second set of instruments in our campaign against poverty  namely  the law governing political parties  new property rights codes  Burundi Vision 2025  a national strategy for democratic government  and the fight against corruption.  Genuine democracy now exists in Burundi. The examples referred to earlier  along with maintaining channels of communication  holding meetings with civil society and the process of implementing   23 11-51191  transitional justice mechanisms  are all additional proof of this fact. Burundi has opened a dialogue with everyone. We can all note with satisfaction  then  that a new chapter has been opened in the history of Burundi.  Democratically elected institutions have led to peace for the first time. The people have decided what should be done  and there has been a peaceful transfer of power. I pay tribute to the people of Burundi for being able to break with the tragic habits of the past  in which the outcome of elections was not respected. Today  the institutions that have been established are legitimate and have the constitutional duty to protect the people  ensure the stability of the country and promote development.  Let us  however  have no illusions. There is still insecurity in the aftermath of the socio-economic reinsertion of former combatants. There are also ongoing problems with the transitional regime  along with a temporary decline in the economic situation of our people  which is traceable to problems in agriculture  climate change and a spike in prices generally and oil.  We should not forget the fact that Burundi is a post-conflict country. In that connection  we are pleased by the surrender of more than 80 000 weapons  which people have handed over. Furthermore  a disarmament commission has been established and the national police have begun to scout for weapons and confiscate them from criminals.   In the area of development  Burundi is continuing its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The number of children is rising  as is that for teachers  because primary education is now free. We have undertaken a number of reforms to train our young people for employment. The Government has undertaken to bring together people in villages so as to ensure the provision of basic services such as drinking water  energy  health care  schools and decent housing  which facilitates reconciliation  security and job creation. This is in addition to free health care for children aged 5 and under and for pregnant women and women who give birth in public health clinics.   To that end  community-level endeavours have enabled us to build more than 2 024 schools and more than 80 health centres and set up more than 2 000 pumps for the provision of drinking water — all of this in three years and without any external assistance.  Numerous development efforts are being undertaken in several key national sectors aimed at enhancing the lives of our people  taking advantage of the integration of Burundi into the East African community.  We regret the continuing security-related incidents caused by armed bandits  land conflicts and the presence of negative forces in certain areas of the Great Lakes region. We were shocked by the terrible tragedy that took place in Gatumba on 18 September 2011. On that dark night  a bloody attack took place in a nightclub that caused the deaths of about 40 people — children  young people  elderly people — of all ethnic groups  genders and political leanings.   The Government reached out to the suffering people  paying the costs of the funerals and attending them. The Government also decided to provide treatment for all those who were injured during the tragedy  and a three-day period of mourning was announced and observed.  We strongly condemn that heinous attack and have called for an inquiry  which should be concluded within a month. Thanks to genuine cooperation on the part of the people  who  having demonstrated considerable restraint  denounced those who allegedly planned and carried out the attack  we are pleased to say that we have made progress in the investigations.   This is yet a further reflection of the commitment of the people of Burundi to peace  which should reassure everyone with regard to the viability and stability of Burundi. That act  while it calls for further vigilance on the part of us all  should not be considered to reflect the current state of our country; if should be seen as an act of terrorism — an isolated incident within the overall context of peace in our country. Such acts of terrorism  massacres and crimes against humanity are  unfortunately  being carried out in a number of countries  which makes it incumbent upon all of us firmly to combat them and bring their perpetrators to justice.  We call on the international community to unreservedly condemn this heinous act and to assist us in prosecuting the masterminds and their henchmen. We call also on the international community to support the operationalization of the National Independent Human Rights Commission that  in a positive step  was recently established in Burundi.    11-51191 24   We take this opportunity also to note that investigation commissions are at work to shed light on the assassinations that have taken place in various parts of the country. We hope that the truth about these events will soon be known and those responsible will be brought to justice.  Our domestic situation is satisfactory  but we cannot but be aware of regional and international concerns. Thus the situation in Somalia  in which Burundi is deeply involved through its participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia  requires additional partners in order for the country to be stabilized and prepared for elections. Those efforts should be carried out in the context of international measures to combat terrorism and also to ensure food security.   In order to be successful in the combat against terrorism  global governance must be able to meet that challenge. There is therefore an urgent need for reform of the Security Council and ongoing interaction between the Council and the General Assembly on all issues of global interest.  Before closing  we would like to congratulate South Sudan on having joined the family of nations  and we support the resolve of the Sudan and of South Sudan to seek ways to peacefully settlement post-referendum issues.   We would like to close by calling on the Assembly to speed up the quest to find a balance between development and the survival of our planet."
"13",512,"BEL",66,2011,"Twelve months ago  I stood here and insisted upon the importance of the principle of accountability. This year there is even more reason to underscore this core value in national and international politics.  In several countries of the Arab world — in Tunisia  Egypt  Morocco  Libya  Syria  Yemen and elsewhere — people are transforming the outlook of their societies  moving towards more accountable leadership.  On the African continent  in Côte d’Ivoire a leader who repeatedly plunged his country into violence did not stand the test of democratic legitimacy. With parliamentary elections scheduled to take place later this year  Côte d’Ivoire is now ready to make a fresh start.  And in Europe the arrest of Ratko Mladic confirms what leaders should know all too well: that war crimes will not remain unpunished for ever  that this world will not accept impunity.  The past year has shown that  more than ever  history is on the side of those who  worldwide  strive for more accountability. They will find Belgium on their side.  Accountability means first of all legal accountability: the obligation to implement international treaties and to respect international law. A former Nuremberg prosecutor  Benjamin Ferencz  stated  “There can be no peace without justice  no justice without law and no meaningful law without a Court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstance”.  Some of the examples I have just mentioned illustrate that all too well. Ratko Mladic is on trial in The Hague. Mass atrocities committed in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya have been referred to the International Criminal Court.  From this place  I would like to launch a strong appeal to those Member States that have not yet done so to adhere to and shoulder the Rome Statute  as a contribution to a sustainable and accountable international legal system.  But accountability is of course much broader. It also implies political accountability. Governments    5 11-51378  politicians and civil servants are accountable and responsible to their citizens  be it through the ballot box or through constructive engagement with representative organizations.  Let me be frank: this is also a challenge in the continent I come from  Europe. We  as European leaders  should not run away from the obligation of being accountable to the people we represent. In the Durban spirit of non-discrimination  let me add: accountable to all the people  regardless of their ethnic background  their religion or belief  their gender  sexual orientation or social position.  Worldwide  the challenges are sometimes of a different order. Let us be clear. Leaders who believe that they can cling to power through terror and suppression make a cruel mistake. Leaders who believe that pointing guns at their own people  that sending death squads on to the streets  that stoning women to death is acceptable  have lost touch with humankind and are bound to lose all support  not only from their own people but also from the world.  Warlords who think that they can get away with sexual abuse of women and recruiting child soldiers should be stopped and held accountable by a united and firm international community.  Belgium will not stand idly by when people claim a future free of coercion and terror. Instead of non-interference  Belgium believes in non-indifference. Sovereignty cannot be a wall that leaders can use to violate the rights of their citizens. Sovereignty cannot be used as an excuse to run away from the responsibility to protect their people.  This is one of the main lessons that I draw from recent events in the Arab world: that democracy and accountability are of a universal nature; that they cannot be claimed  and should not be claimed  by any nation or group of nations.  Take the case of Libya  where the Security Council was able to prevent a massacre in Benghazi. Belgium decided  with almost unanimous support in Parliament  to take part in the military Operation Unified Protector  assuming the risk and the cost.   That was because Belgium is convinced that the international community has the responsibility to take action when populations are exposed to imminent danger. Molière said long ago that we are responsible not only for what we do  but for what we do not do.   Today  now that the immediate danger is fading  the international community has a responsibility to help in the reconstruction of Libya. Let us not forget that that responsibility is an integral part of the responsibility to protect. Belgium will contribute.   Let us look at the rest of the African continent  whose peoples want their voice to be heard through free and fair elections. In that context  I wish to make specific mention of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where  after years of violence  undeniable progress has been made.   The important part played by the United Nations  and in particular by the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  cannot be ignored.   There are still significant challenges to be overcome. They include the continuation and strengthening of stabilization efforts in the east of country  the reform of the security sector  the establishment of the rule of law and countering impunity and sexual violence.   Those are essential ingredients in the consolidation of democracy. The 2006 elections put the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the road to democracy. The elections to be held at the end of November should confirm that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is ready once and for all to move on from its bloody past.   As an important partner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  my Government is contributing financially to the preparations for the elections  and demands that every candidate and every citizen be able to participate peacefully and with full respect for democratic rules. Let us finally look at the Middle East  a conflict region that has this week received much attention here in the Hall. Dag Hammarskjöld  to whom this week is dedicated and who himself devoted much of his effort to finding a lasting peace in that region  said more than half a century ago: “The building of a firm bridge … over which you can pass without any difficulties may be a long story”. More than 50 years later  we still do not have such a “firm bridge”. That is not acceptable.     11-51378 6   The parameters of a sustainable solution are well known. Both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples have legitimate aspirations. People want statehood. People want to live in peace and security. These were the messages that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu brought us yesterday. It must be possible to satisfy both legitimate needs.  Over the past few months  the European Union and its High Representative have spared no effort to get a process of negotiations started. There is no alternative to negotiations  however difficult and risky the path may be. It is therefore my sincere hope that the steps proposed by the Quartet yesterday will be fully implemented.  It is also clear that the Palestinian Authority has successfully progressed on the road to statehood  also thanks to the important and sustained contributions by the European Union and by Belgium  and that it has now reached a level of statehood that the world cannot ignore.  Now is the time to show leadership. After all  that is what accountability towards the people of the region is all about.  Many have said it before: the global challenges we face are multiple. They range from terrorism to climate change and sustainable development — in which regard the upcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development will ask a lot of our energy and creativity in the months ahead; from financial turmoil to terrible humanitarian tragedies like the one in the Horn of Africa; from banning cluster munitions to curbing nuclear proliferation  notably in North Korea and Iran; from guaranteeing the responsible and transparent exploitation of natural resources through schemes such as the Kimberley Process; through to fully implementing the indicators of the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security.  For Belgium  the only way to address those challenges is through a multilateral approach. No country  however big or important  is capable of tackling global challenges alone. No country  however modest in size it may be  should think that it cannot be part of the solution.  Multilateralism is not about blocking solutions. It should lead to change  and should have at its centre the United Nations  which indeed has proved its added value in so many fields. Let me mention just one such field to which Belgium attaches particular importance: international conflict mediation.  When the Secretary-General addressed us earlier this week he mentioned Guinea  Kenya and Kyrgyzstan as United Nations mediation successes. The list is undoubtedly longer  but so are the needs. I am therefore grateful to the President of the General Assembly for choosing mediation as a central theme for our debate. I strongly believe that the United Nations should continue to invest in strengthening its mediation capacities.  I am proud to announce that Belgium has decided to financially support the United Nations Mediation Support Unit and to actively engage with the President and with other Governments and non-governmental stakeholders to strengthen the role of United Nations mediation efforts.  Some say that the United Nations is losing its power as a global platform for discussion and decision-making. Some say that global trends point towards a more fragmented structure of global governance. I do not think that that is true. I would certainly not think that it was desirable.  Belgium remains a staunch supporter of the United Nations. Our current engagement in the Peacebuilding Commission and our bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2019-2020 show our willingness to play our role in the United Nations.  Today I am also proud to introduce Belgium’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period 2015-2018  to add our voice to those who fight impunity and discrimination; to give a voice to those men  women and children who worldwide see their rights curtailed; to turn the principle of non-indifference into a living reality. That is not for the sake of ourselves  but for the sake of those to whom we are accountable."
"14",557,"BEN",66,2011,"I should like at the outset to convey to you  Sir  my heartfelt and sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and to wish you every success in discharging your mandate.   I should like also to reiterate my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. I assure him of the full cooperation of the Government of Benin and the personal support of its Head of State in the vast   37 11-51670  undertaking that is the modernization of the United Nations  which he has been working towards since he took the helm of the Organization.   I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Joseph Deiss for the outstanding manner in which he carried out his mission as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  I should like to commend the selection of the theme of the sixty-sixth session  “The role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes”. This reflects a recognition of the importance of dialogue and of the responsibility of third parties in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Conflicts  crises and wars represent a large part of the challenges faced by humankind. They undermine poorer States  whose efforts are often undone by indiscriminate violence  as deadly as it is destructive.   This legitimate interest in the use of mediation should serve as a catalyst for raising the awareness of stakeholders in all regions of the world as to the need to accord greater importance to dialogue in resolving problems  nationally and in the context of inter-State  bilateral  regional and international relations.  We would therefore like to commend the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union within the context of the special political missions  which are an optimum framework for mediation. Such partnerships can help to avert redundancy and duplication  which can be counter-productive and doom mediation efforts to failure.  Benin  for its part  which owes much to dialogue  very early on grasped the importance of that tool in the prevention and resolution of crises at the national level. In that respect  I believe it appropriate here to draw the attention of the international community to the fact that the Government of Benin has given high priority to the issue of mediation in its programme of action and  in that context  established the Office of the Ombudsman. We would also like to commend the creation  at the regional level  of the Association of Ombudsmen of Member Countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union  which Benin chairs; indeed  most of the countries in the Union are relying on this important tool for the maintenance of peace.  Perhaps we should go even further and establish civil entities for mediation and the restoration of peace  whose members would meet with the parties to a conflict so as to re-establish dialogue among them and to prevail upon them to resolve their disputes peacefully.  The current state of the world makes clear the urgent need to strengthen multilateralism  with a view to averting the collective collapse that could result if appropriate or consensual solutions are not rapidly found to the global problems afflicting the world today. At the national level  we require greater cohesion among the vital forces of the country and greater determination in the context of actions aimed at eliminating the obstacles that impede development. With respect to preserving democratic institutions  when the fundamental values enshrined in the Charter are at stake  the United Nations must be at the forefront of the efforts of the international community.  In that regard  impartiality cannot be synonymous with neutrality  which would be unfathomable and make the United Nations a passive bystander to the triumph of aggression over the rule of law. I should therefore like to thank the Secretary-General for the courageous choices he has made.   In Benin  democracy has been strengthened by the tireless commitment of the United Nations to ensuring electoral transparency  which it accomplished through its support for the creation of a computerized permanent voters’ list  which prevents any manipulation or other fraudulent manoeuvres and thereby ensures fairness in our country’s elections.  Based on the success of our young democracy in Benin  my Government has been working to consolidate cooperative governance at both the national and local levels  so as to maximize the impact of the resources that have been mobilized and earmarked for the promotion of the well-being of all the citizens of our country. Accordingly  far-reaching reforms have been undertaken to reorganize the State and rid the country of the structural and behavioural incoherence that has impeded the State in its efforts to govern effectively.  The strengthening of democratic institutions and a fresh balance of powers is at the very heart of the constitutional review that is under discussion. Such a review must in no way affect the principal mechanisms that ensure the alternance of power  that is  the number of terms allowed the President of the Republic — strictly limited to two — and the age limitation of    11-51670 38  70 years  beyond which one cannot run for the highest office in Benin.  The fight against corruption is a crucial aspect of that effort to streamline the State apparatus. The adoption in late August 2011 of a new law to fight corruption is in keeping with the national dynamic of ensuring transparency in the management of the State’s resources and in the resolute fight undertaken against any practices that deny citizens the ability fully to enjoy the fruits of their labour. That new law enables us to better combat the various forms of illicit enrichment  as today it is up to the accused to justify the source of his wealth  not the accuser. This is a revolutionary development in the context Benin’s judicial and legislative mechanisms.  At the global level  we believe in the benefits of multilateralism. That is why we see an ever greater need for the United Nations  which should be given a more assertive role in global governance — a United Nations that would spearhead and lead of actions aimed at promoting  within an inclusive framework  comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the manifold crises that are affecting the world and having direct repercussions for human rights.   Our Government  throughout its term in the Human Rights Council  intends  together with other members of the Council  to work to promote and protect universally recognized human rights  in a spirit of cooperation. Benin firmly believes in the universality  the indivisibility and the interdependence of all human rights. It has faith in international cooperation as the most effective means for promoting and protecting all universally recognized human rights.  Let us recognize the ongoing efforts made in past years by each of our countries  and collectively through international organizations both regional and universal  to manage the consequences of the various crises that affect the world  particularly developing countries — food  energy  financial  economic and environmental crises.   However  the international economic situation remains sluggish and uncertain. Indeed  the long-awaited international economic recovery remains slow and tenuous  while financial and stock market turbulence continues to affect the international market.  Even today  more than two thirds of the 800 million people in the least developed countries (LDCs) are living in poverty. The economic indicators of those nations — which have made prodigious efforts and heavy sacrifices to emerge from underdevelopment — call for great prudence with regard to attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  Despite that rather bleak picture  we should continue our efforts to ensure that our countries can make progress in the spheres of good governance  development  health  water  sanitation  primary education for all and the empowerment of women and youth.  The developing countries  particularly the LDCs  need more than ever the transfer of modern technology to increase and diversify production  take a greater part in international trade and build the infrastructure required for development. The developed countries and the countries of the South that are experiencing significant economic growth should establish facilities to that end  as was agreed at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Istanbul from 9 to 13 May 2011. The new programme of action adopted at that Conference clearly reflects our shared ambition to ensure that half those countries move to the category of middle-income nations by 2020.   But however noble the goals set forth in the Istanbul Programme of Action may be  they cannot be achieved unless we respect the commitments already made. For that reason  despite the cyclical difficulties that characterize the current global economic situation  we must remain firm in our resolve to move forward.   There is no stable financial support for the development efforts of the LDCs without stable sources of financing. Therefore the Government of Benin strongly supports the innovative financing initiative for development. We call on the nations of the Group of 20 to take a closer look at that initiative so that taxation of financial transactions becomes a tangible reality during the weeks and months to come.  Threats related to climate change — particularly the continuing deterioration of the environment and drought  a source of famine in some parts of Africa — and the recurrence of natural disasters greatly undermine the future prospects of the LDCs.   Benin commends the United Nations preparatory work for the Rio+20 Summit planned for Brazil in June 2012. We hope those meetings will lead to robust   39 11-51670  measures and decisions that match the perils that await us.  The threats that curtail our ambitions stem from other factors as well  such as the surge in transnational organized crime  which is quite pernicious. My country  Benin  has in recent months been the target of extremely serious and savage acts of piracy  armed robbery at sea and an influx of narcotics and counterfeit medicines. This scourge has not spared other countries of the Gulf of Guinea  which have also been affected to varying degrees. We are particularly distressed not only by the escalating number of such attacks and the increasingly sophisticated methods the pirates employ  but also and especially by the expansion of their field of action and the immediate effect of these attacks on port activities in Benin.  That situation complicates Benin’s efforts to find the resources to handle the economic and financial difficulties related to external shocks  the repercussions of which severely impact the economy of small countries like ours. It also seriously hampers our ability to achieve the MDGs. The Government of Benin is working with our neighbour Nigeria to mobilize the countries of the Gulf of Guinea subregion for a coordinated response by developing and implementing a regional approach that involves joint manoeuvres to be launched shortly by the armed forces of Benin and Nigeria along the coast of Benin.  I call for the effective solidarity of States with expertise in the area of maritime operations to come to our assistance. Our resources are laughable  given the magnitude of the threat. Clearly  the fight against piracy requires technical and financial resources that a developing State cannot provide alone. Here I would like to thank the United States  France  China and other countries that have already shown spontaneous solidarity toward Benin.  The matters to which we need to find solutions grow ever more complex. The United Nations must continually improve its ability to closely define the challenges facing humanity and to help States formulate appropriate responses while preserving the delicate balance of interests of all stakeholders  as evidence of its efficiency and efficacy.   Along these lines  the negotiations to reform the Security Council must be intensified with the adoption of a specific timetable for their outcome  to be credible. My sense is that 2015 could be considered a deadline for completing negotiations and establishing an inclusive Security Council that would redress the historical injustice done to Africa with respect to its permanent representation in that body  which crowns the collective security system established by the United Nations Charter.   Benin says no  no  and a third time no. The time has come to put an end to an intolerable injustice that excludes an entire continent — the only one  Africa — from the supreme decision-making body with respect to international security.   I am certain that completion of Security Council reform will lead to greater trust and less suspicion in the management of today’s great challenges in the realm of international peace and security.  My country has always advocated strengthening conflict prevention as a means to ensure international peace and security at less cost. Efforts to that end must be tirelessly pursued.   Prevention also includes effectively supporting young people to prepare them for their responsibilities  protect them from the risks they face and channel their energies towards participation in the development of their countries. We need to remove the obstacles that deter or prevent them from fulfilling their potential and divert them to risky behaviour of all kinds that harm public order and the stability of States.   That is why my Government was firmly committed to the holding of the United Nations High-level Meeting on Youth. Now that it has taken place  we need to do our utmost to ensure that its conclusions on youth are translated into specific actions as soon as possible. The great interest in that High-level Meeting shown by young people around the world reflects their will to become more involved in the search for appropriate solutions to the challenges facing humankind.   The Government of my country also believes that it would be useful for the United Nations to hold youth hearings every year  or every other year  to enable youth from around the world to address a specific subject  with broad participation of young delegates and young leaders of non-governmental organizations. Such regular mobilization of the world’s young people in the heart of the United Nations would make our world Organization more inclusive and closer to our peoples.     11-51670 40   For us in Benin — and I quote the President of the Republic  Mr. Boni Yayi — “there is no doubt that only those societies that give young people opportunities will be able to meet the challenges to come”.  From 16 to 20 November 2010  Benin hosted an international symposium on the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of African countries. That meeting culminated in the drafting of an important historic document entitled “The Fiftieth Anniversary Manifesto”. The African Union  at its most recent summit  held in Malabo on 30 June and 1 July  adopted the Manifesto as a reference document for the renaissance of the African continent.   The Anniversary Manifesto details  in the context of globalization  felicitous prospects with regard the challenges facing Africa in the coming 50 years  which will require new partnership approaches to promote development and more effective collective action for the renaissance of the continent. I firmly hope that the Manifesto will be taken to heart equally by the United Nations and lead to synergy and better coordination of efforts to mobilize the international community for the economic development of African countries so as to meet the legitimate aspirations of the people of the continent.  In conclusion  I want to note that recent history teaches us that the greatest threats to international peace and security come from peoples who have long been frustrated. The Palestinian question makes the Arab nation a frustrated nation. The United Nations today has the means to find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem  and it must not fail to meet its historic responsibility.   We support a free and independent Palestinian State living in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel. Benin gives ongoing support to the one-land  two-State solution and calls upon the Security Council to facilitate the prompt resolution of the problem  to bring relief to the Palestinian people  who endure daily suffering.   We believe in the virtue of mediation. The choice of that option as a way to resolve conflicts around the world in this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly offers a last chance for the two parties to re-engage in dialogue to finally bring lasting peace to the Middle East and to the world. The peace that we all so wish for must be based on universal respect for the cardinal principles and fundamental values contained in the United Nations Charter. "
"15",603,"BFA",66,2011,"The annual general debate of the General Assembly always serves as an opportunity for the international community to consider the state of the world through a series of exchanges and thus combine innovative ideas to support our desire to create a community that will ensure a better future for all. Burkina Faso always participates in this meeting of the world partnership with great interest.  Before I go any further  please allow me  Mr. President  to offer you sincere and warm congratulations from the Government and people of Burkina Faso on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  for which you have chosen the theme of strengthening mediation as a means of preventing and settling conflicts. Burkina Faso fully supports this choice and is committed to sharing with the international community its experience in peace negotiations  particularly with   21 11-51670  regard to the role of mediator for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that President Blaise Compaoré played in settling the crises in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea.  I would also like to commend your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  on the efficiency with which he guided the work of the sixty-fifth session. And I congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his successful reappointment to the leadership of the United Nations. I wish him health and every success for his second term.  I salute the Republic of South Sudan’s achievement of independence and international sovereignty  and welcome it to the great family that is the United Nations. The Government of Burkina Faso offers its sincere and willing cooperation to the South Sudanese people and authorities.  Much has happened since our last session to affect the development of the world and our States. Some countries have been victims of natural catastrophe; others have experienced financial  political and social crises. At the beginning of the year my country  Burkina Faso  also had to deal with social demands arising from the difficult national and economic situation. Fortunately  those demands  which were followed by social unrest  were resolved  thanks to a sustained and inclusive dialogue initiated by President Compaoré. This dialogue  involving all of the country’s social classes  enabled the Government to conduct an exchange of views with every element of our society on their concerns  with the aim of arriving at suitable solutions.  Furthermore  the Government of Burkina Faso  within the framework of strengthening the rule of law and improving and reinforcing our system of political and institutional governance  established an advisory council for political reform aimed at continuing with the political and institutional reforms that began several years ago. In the economic and social areas  as part of our accelerated growth and sustainable development strategy  my Government  despite its modest budget and many other constraints and priorities  continued its efforts to build a functioning economy  with a particular emphasis on strengthening certain key sectors  including education  health  water  training and youth employment; on improving socio-economic infrastructure  especially roads; and on encouraging the business environment.  Needless to say  this progress was made possible thanks to the cooperation and support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank them for their continuing commitment to supporting us and for their backing for our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  At the subregional and continental levels  Burkina Faso  working within the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union  ECOWAS and the African Union  will continue to be constructively involved in strengthening the integration process. While we proclaim our faith and deep attachment to the regional integration process taking place in Africa  we are convinced that regional integration must be pragmatic and based on concrete achievements  which represent the only way we can realize our peoples’ legitimate aspirations. At the regional level  we recognize the value of all the initiatives that the African Union has taken to manage and settle conflicts on our continent. Burkina Faso reaffirms its continuing readiness to contribute to maintaining peace  security and stability all over Africa.  The world is currently experiencing times of enormous uncertainty and anxiety as a result of international economic and financial instability  increased poverty  continuing deterioration of the environment and a growing number of natural disasters. In particular  the recent international financial crises are dangerously compromising the balance of our economies and putting our social cohesion to a terrible test. They demand a response  constant vigilance and firm solidarity on all our parts.  The harmful effects of climate change have spared no country; natural disasters  in particular  have compromised and shaken the foundations of development for many of us  especially the least-developed countries  which are especially vulnerable and suffer the most. In tackling this scourge  special attention and renewed effort on the part of the international community are more necessary than ever in regard to climate issues  as well as every other environmental concern. Among other initiatives  Burkina Faso commends that of Mrs. Hilary Clinton  Secretary of State of the United States  for the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves  from which countries such as Burkina Faso could benefit greatly.    11-51670 22   The High-level Meeting held during this session on the theme “Addressing desertification  land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication”  as well as the signing by various countries  including Burkina Faso  of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity  are also events worthy of commendation.  Burkina Faso considers particularly important all issues connected to the advancement of women and  to that end  has spared no effort to improve the social and legal status of women in our country. We therefore commend the Organization’s establishment of UN-Women  and hope that this new body  which should be adequately funded  will be a genuine catalyst for United Nations activities in defence of women’s rights. More specifically  we hope it will provide strengthened support for pro-women policies in developing countries. We are pleased that during this session the African Group will be introducing a draft resolution intended to ban female genital mutilation worldwide. We hope that it will be supported by the entire international community.  For more than a decade we have been working on the process of reforming the United Nations in order to enable it to be in step with the demands of a world in constant change. Unfortunately  despite significant progress  much still remains to be done. Burkina Faso believes that the reforms must take into account the interests of all Member States and increase our Organization’s effectiveness in managing the peace and security  stability and development of all parties.  At the dawn of the third millennium  our hope and wish was that this millennium would see us reconcile with one another and bring peace  security and stability. Sadly  our planet is still beset by numerous conflicts  many of which bear the mark of international terrorism  which  needless to say  Burkina Faso firmly condemns in all its forms and manifestations. That is why Burkina Faso  which fervently advocates for the prevention and settlement of conflicts through dialogue  commends the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role of mediation in peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention and resolution. We are pleased that that resolution was introduced by the Group of Friends of Mediation  of which Burkina Faso is a member.  As we did in Guinea  Côte d’Ivoire  Togo and Darfur  Burkina Faso is fully prepared to contribute wherever it is called upon for mediation  peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The organization of free and transparent elections in Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire came as a result of the successful facilitation efforts of Mr. Blaise Compaoré  President of Burkina Faso.  The Ouagadougou Political Agreement allowed Côte d’Ivoire to emerge from crisis. What it needs now is peacebuilding and reconciliation. We take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General  who effectively supported the efforts of ECOWAS and the inter-Ivorian dialogue facilitator. Beyond facilitation  we are prepared to assist all countries in our subregion in their quest for peace and stability in post-conflict situations. We call on the international community to support peacebuilding efforts  especially in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea.   Burkina Faso participates in the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  with a force of 800 men. The signing on 14 July 2011 of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur between the Government of the Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement represents significant progress towards restoring lasting peace.  Thanks to the trust placed in us by the African Union and the United Nations we were able to support the peace process  and we call on all parties to the conflict to sign the Doha Document. We express our recognition and profound gratitude to the Emir of Qatar  His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  for his support  which was critical to the success of the process.  In the framework of the Implementation Follow-up Committee  my country will continue to contribute to peacebuilding. We call on the Justice and Equality Movement  the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Government of the Sudan to bring hostilities to a complete halt in Darfur as soon as possible.  In North Africa a will for change has found expression in Tunisia  Egypt and Libya. Burkina Faso expresses its solidarity with those countries in their quest for freedom and democracy. We reiterate our will to strengthen fruitful links of cooperation. Burkina Faso reaffirms its recognition of the Transitional   23 11-51670  National Council in Libya  and we encourage it to continue to promote democracy  national cohesion  stability and security for all people living in Libya.   In the Middle East we closely follow the progress of the Palestinian question  and we support Palestine’s request to be admitted to the United Nations as a full Member State. We reiterate our call for a lasting  comprehensive peace in the region that guarantees the freedom and right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the security of the State of Israel.  Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism  in solidarity among peoples and in the virtue of dialogue among nations. My delegation notes with great satisfaction the peaceful climate that currently prevails in the relationship between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That will favour the granting to the Republic of China on Taiwan the place that it deserves in the concert of nations  including its genuine participation in the activities of international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and conferences such as those on the United Nations Climate Change Convention.   In conclusion  I wish to express the desire that the virtues of international solidarity and dialogue among nations will continue to inspire the United Nations  which is the pre-eminent forum for multilateralism  so that together we can respond to the challenges that our world faces."
"16",646,"BGD",66,2011,"I warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that under his able and dynamic stewardship  we will achieve our goals. I thank former President Joseph Deiss for the success of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the wise selection of the theme “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” for this year’s general debate.   I take this opportunity to welcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations and warmly congratulate the people of the newest State on attaining their freedom and independence.  I believe that peace is the basis for development. I also believe that peace prevails when justice prevails. Therefore  justice at home and abroad is important for ensuring the peaceful mediation and settlement of disputes. My father and the father of my nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  who espoused the principles of “friendship towards all  malice towards none” and “peaceful settlement of disputes”  also believed in this  and declared it from this rostrum 37 years ago.  Thus  justice for peace found its place in my Government’s domestic and foreign policy and has contributed to strengthening Bangladesh’s secular  democratic and progressive ideals. A strong foundation in the rule of law has also helped in the peaceful settlement of disputes with our neighbours and formed the basis of our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Emphasis on peaceful negotiations has also enabled Bangladesh to maintain an annual gross domestic product growth rate of 6 per cent  create thousands of jobs  reduce poverty and expand social safety net schemes to the poor  disadvantaged  elderly and deprived women.   41 11-51360   The role of the United Nations has changed since its establishment. The maintenance of international peace and security now includes the new challenges of intra-State ethnic strife  terrorism  transnational crimes  climate change  poverty  energy and water security  as well as the widening gap between the rich and the poor. However  the successes of the United Nations have reinforced the belief that  in the twenty-first century  it remains the most legitimate and universally accepted international body with the ability to harness the global collective will necessary for the peaceful settlement of disputes through mediation.  Bangladesh therefore commends the Secretary-General’s report on enhancing mediation and its support activities (S/2009/189) for promoting the better use of the United Nations mediation mandate  and co-sponsored resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution.   To demonstrate its strong commitment to conflict resolution  Bangladesh has partnered in many United Nations endeavours for peace  democracy and development. Our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping of 102 294 peacekeepers in 52 missions and 36 countries has sadly led to the loss of the lives of 103 brave Bangladeshis. Our involvement also includes the first all-women United Nations police unit in Haiti.  As Non-Aligned Movement Coordinator in the Peacebuilding Commission  Bangladesh is always advocating in favour of peacebuilding  development and preventive diplomacy in post-conflict societies. Unfortunately  we remain woefully underrepresented at the planning and strategy-making levels of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  which should be promptly redressed. As a member of the Human Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council  we conscientiously promote democracy  secularism  justice and the rule of law  and equal rights for women  children  minorities and other vulnerable groups. As a member of the executive bodies of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations Population Fund  UNICEF  UNESCO and the Food and Agriculture Organization  we are committed to setting global norms and standards in development practices.  Since I believe that justice brings peace  in 1997  during my previous term as Prime Minister  I mediated the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord for the marginalized communities of the Hill Tracts region. The Accord  which was signed after intense discussions  ended a 20-year conflict that cost over 20 000 lives. During the same term  I mediated the signing of the 30-year Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with neighbouring India. During my current term  this month we mediated and signed memoranda of understanding with India on our border demarcation  an issue that had been pending for the past 64 years  causing obstructions in the everyday life of my people. I am committed to settling all our problems with neighbouring India through discussion.  During my current term and soon after forming the Government  one of the most dangerous challenges that I have faced was the mutiny of our border forces  which took 72 lives. Yet  that time  too  I chose a mediated settlement  thereby avoiding possible further loss of life. As a result  I came to believe that there can be no peace without justice. We have established an independent International Crimes Tribunal to try those responsible for war crimes committed during our liberation war in 1971. Their eventual punishment will strengthen our democracy and show that the State is capable of just retribution.  As a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  we believe in the Statute’s mandate of bringing perpetrators to justice. I am fully committed to battling terrorism in all its forms  having personally suffered from acts of terror. Here  I recall with profound sadness the brutal assassination of my father  the first President of Bangladesh  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and 18 of my immediate family members  including my mother and three brothers  on 15 August 1975. I also recall the grenade attack on me and my followers at a peace rally on 21 August 2004  which left 24 dead and nearly 500 injured. I miraculously escaped but with permanent loss of hearing.  I often think of all the victims of terrorism  especially those of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York  as well as attacks that have taken place elsewhere in the world. Indeed  if peace is to prevail  these terrorists must be brought to justice.  Our Government has a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism. Our aim is to break the nexus between terrorism  extremism and radicalization and eliminate all of them from Bangladesh  a State party to all United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. At the same time  we are strengthening our democratic    11-51360 42  institutions  such as the commissions on elections  anti-corruption  human rights  information  as well as our judiciary  legislature and law enforcement agencies  which are tools for eliminating terrorism and extremism.  Since justice begets peace and peace is vital for development  our policies are attuned to ensuring peoples’ rights. In pursuing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we are also fulfilling our people’s aspirations. The United Nations Award for MDG 4 on reducing child mortality  which I received last year  is a case in point. We are also on track to achieve MDG 1 on poverty alleviation  MDG 2 on universal primary education  MDG 3 on gender equality and MDG 5 on reducing maternal mortality. Our poverty reduction strategy is in tandem with the Millennium Development Goals and intends to raise 12 million people out of poverty by 2015.  For development  we have integrated women’s education into our State policy. There is a saying that goes  “If you educate a boy  you educate a person; if you educate a girl  you educate a family and a whole nation”. Therefore  during our first term from 1996 to 2001  we adopted a national women’s development policy that has been revised during our current term to make it more relevant. The policy provides for the empowerment of women  their participation in decision-making  their protection  and gender equality. Education for girls is free up to the twelfth grade  and steps are on their way to ensure their free tuition until graduation.  Following the 2008 general elections  women’s participation in politics increased with their election to 12 828 reserved seats in local Government bodies and 64 members in the national Parliament. We also have five women Cabinet ministers in charge of agriculture  home  foreign affairs  women’s and children’s affairs  and labour. The Opposition Leader  the Deputy Leader  a Whip and  of course  the Prime Minister are all women. For the first time in our history  two women Members of Parliament have been made Chairs of Parliamentary Standing Committees. Women now occupy high positions in the Supreme Court  in civil  police and armed services  and in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Female business ventures also receive support from the Small and Medium Enterprise Foundation.  To achieve our election pledge of a digital Bangladesh and to make Bangladesh a middle-income country by 2021  the golden jubilee year of our independence  we are expanding the reach of information and communications technology throughout the country. UNDP Administrator Helen Clark was with us this year to witness the launching of e-connectivity through our 4 500 information and service centres  which provide Internet access to millions of rural people. We have also set up an e-centre for rural communities  which connects 8 500 post offices  a high-tech park  e-governance capabilities and an e-infrastructure-building process.   I believe in that health for all is an essential precondition for development. Primary health-care services are delivered through 11 000 community health centres in rural areas  with each providing services to 6 000 people. My Government has also recently started raising awareness about autism and developmental disorders in children. Last July  we launched the Global Autism Public Health Initiative in Dhaka to help those disadvantaged with such disorders.  However  to pursue those efforts and to develop socio-economic security  least developed countries (LDCs)  such as Bangladesh  need international support. The support must come from granting us market access  removing trade barriers  the fulfilment of overseas development aid and combating climate change. The commitments made in Istanbul this May on agriculture  energy  infrastructure  water and migration would also strengthen the economic stability of LDCs. It is now time for development partners to implement the commitments made in Monterrey  Paris and Brussels before the conclusion of the Doha Development Round. Support must continue to enable LDCs to fulfil their Millennium Development Goals.  Such support is especially important for Bangladesh under the extra tension of climate change. A metre rise in the sea level due to global warming would inundate a fifth of our landmass  displacing over 30 million people. That would be the largest humanitarian crisis in history. In order not to lose time  we have prepared a 134-point adaptation and mitigation plan that includes river dredging  afforestation of 20 per cent of the land  increasing food production with crop varieties adapted to climate change  et cetera. We also established the Climate Change Trust Fund with $300 million from our own   43 11-51360  funds and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund with $110 million from donors.   Bangla is spoken by over 300 million people worldwide. I earnestly appeal to Member States to back my proposal to declare Bangla one of the official languages of the United Nations. I also seek their support for Bangladesh’s annual flagship resolution on a culture of peace  which I launched in 2000  when I was Prime Minister for the first time.  Throughout my half-century in politics  I have always been a crusader of peace. I believe that peace is achievable by eliminating injustices  which includes Repression  the absence of the rule of law  inequality  economic disparity  deprivation  poverty  the suppression of self-determination  the denial of secularism and multi-ethnicity  the negligence of equal rights for women and the marginalized  and the lack of transparency and accountability of Governments. Those types of injustices  according to the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme  led to the loss of more than 5 million lives from 1964 to 2011. I believe that such deaths could have been avoided by strengthening the mediation instruments of the United Nations and by placing people at the centre of peace and development.  In fact  my life experiences have inspired me to come up with a new peace model  based on the empowerment of people. It is a multidimensional plan that champions democracy and places people’s empowerment at the centre  with six mutually reinforcing peace multipliers. They are: first  the eradication of poverty and hunger; secondly  the reduction of inequality; thirdly  the mitigation of deprivation; fourthly  the inclusion of excluded persons; fifthly  the acceleration of human development; and sixthly  the elimination of terrorism.  I call it the people’s empowerment model. It reaffirms that all people should be treated equally  and emphasizes the empowerment of people and the enhancement of human capabilities for the realization of peace.  Prosperity is achievable with the removal of injustice and disempowerment in an environment of peace. That is possible by individual nations through sincere implementation of what is right  sometimes under the guidance of the United Nations. Let us all try to test that model of people’s empowerment  which I believe has the potential to transform our world of 7 billion people into one where our future generations may prosper and live in happiness.  May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the United Nations."
"17",692,"BGR",66,2011,"Let me begin by praising His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdelaziz Al-Nasser for his steady stewardship as the President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In his work he can count on the constructive engagement of the Bulgarian delegation. Allow me also personally to praise him for the theme he has chosen for this session. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his    11-51197 18  outstanding leadership of the previous session’s busy agenda. Last but not least  let me congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his reappointment to the helm of the United Nations. He has proven himself to be a diligent  hard-working leader who believes strongly in consensus and harmony  qualities that the United Nations needs now in its top administrator and will undoubtedly need even more in years to come.  I begin by welcoming the work of delegations at the United Nations High-level Meeting on non-communicable diseases. Cancer  cardiovascular diseases  chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are now responsible for more deaths than all other causes combined. Bulgaria welcomes the negotiated final document. More than 80 per cent of cardiovascular and diabetes deaths  almost 90 per cent of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and more than two thirds of all cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Bulgaria also particularly welcomes the High-level Meeting on nuclear safety and security. The effects of nuclear accidents have no respect for national borders. To adequately safeguard our people we must have firm international consensus and action  as well as agreement on stringent international safety standards.   Today we stand on the doorstep of historic change in the Middle East  the scale of which can only be compared to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the sweeping transformation of Central and Eastern Europe after the end of communism. Both processes are quite different but share a fundamental similarity — people have come out of the bondage of fear. Although the circumstances in each country are different  the root causes for what is happening in the Middle East are quite similar. Corrupt leadership breeds dissent  and with no democratic process in place  that dissent pours out on to the streets. Young people want to be engaged in the future of their countries  not forced into a world of virtual reality by frowning aging dictators. Millions of people who live on the brink of poverty and see a privileged few reap the benefits of economic freedom will demand fair economic opportunities for all.  Add to that the feeling of revival and the demand of millions of young Arabs to be respected  and you have the makings of a revolution of Arab dignity and self-respect  an historic revolution indeed. As change swept across the Middle East and North Africa  some leaders cringed in fear  others embraced it. Those who opposed their people are no longer in positions of power  and their countries are moving on and looking to democratic elections. Those who embraced change have initiated far-reaching reforms and responded to the legitimate demands of their people. His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan and His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Morocco should to be commended for their vision and willingness to reform. They have shown the way forward.   At the same time  the international community has been appalled by the developments in Syria. Instead of responding to the legitimate demands of the Syrian people for the fulfilment of promised reforms  the Government cracked down violently on protesters. The protesters did not have unrealistic demands. They did not ask for anything out of the ordinary. According to the United Nations more than 2 600 people have been killed since March. The Government in Damascus questions those numbers. Even if only one person had been killed  it would have been one person too many.   The responsibility for repression lies squarely with the authorities and no one else. I use this opportunity to call on President Al-Assad  who has made many promises to his people and the international community  to come out from the shadows  change the Constitution  dismantle the machinery of repression and immediately call for internationally supervised elections. The people of Syria have the right to elect their own Government and hold it accountable. The time for transition has come.  At this session we welcomed the 193rd Member of the United Nations. Our hearts go out to the people of South Sudan  who have struggled for independence  and we commend the visionary leadership of their Government for paving the way for their independence in a peaceful manner. We also welcomed the new representatives of a free Libya  free from the oppression of the Al-Qadhafi dictatorship. It was at the gates of Benghazi in February that the international community  acting on a mandate of the United Nations Security Council  acted swiftly to prevent a massacre and protect civilians against attacks from their own Government.   The people of Libya proved that they could stand up and defend their right to freedom. Our thoughts go out to the families of all those who lost their lives in this struggle and fell victim to the crazed ambitions of a deluded dictator. Bulgaria stands ready to assist the   19 11-51197  people of Libya in rebuilding their country. Our friendship is strong and has been tested through the years.   We know at first hand the brutality that Al-Qadhafi was capable of. The five Bulgarian nurses and a doctor who spent eight years of their lives in a Libyan jail  much of it on death row  are still haunted by their tortures. Let me quote one of them who recently said in an interview  “We died every time the cell door opened.” Now safely back home  they need to be able to close that chapter of their nightmares. Like the nurses  innocent victims of a brutal dictatorship  the Libyan people do want to see justice  not revenge. Such justice will be sought when the dictator and his cronies are brought before a court of law.  No matter how successful we are individually we cannot truly enjoy the fruits of our own development if we live in an insecure environment. Regional cooperation and good-neighbourly relations are vital for the well-being of our countries and our societies. Let me turn briefly to the Balkans.   The European Union was created to make war impossible in a continent that has seen at least a century of conflicts. Europe will not be whole and complete until our neighbours in the Balkans are part of our Union. It falls to us to say it loud and clear: to make war impossible in the Balkans we must see all countries that have emerged from the former Yugoslavia as part of the European Union. That is our historic mission. It is our destiny. That is why we will continue to work tirelessly to remove the obstacles to European Union enlargement in the Balkans  to strengthen regional cooperation and develop good-neighbourly relations in a region that has seen too much division and violence.   With particular vigour  we will continue to encourage the European Union-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. Bulgaria welcomes the pragmatic approach taken by both Kosovo and Serbia during their first meetings. It is important that they build on this momentum and continue to engage in a constructive and pragmatic manner. All must show restraint and prevent the build-up of tension. That is vital for the security  prosperity and  ultimately  the European perspective of the region.  Bulgaria is a country that has a proud and turbulent history. Our history teaches us that nations are strong when their civic spirit is strong. It teaches us that you must find pride not only in great historic battles and ancient legends but in great feats of civic activism  in standing up for your values and protecting your neighbours. One such inspiring example is the fact that the Jews of Bulgaria survived the Second World War because hundreds of religious and community leaders  politicians  ordinary men and women  stood up and refused to be part of Hitler’s madness. My country today is the product of the traditions of Christians  Jews and Muslims  who all form the fabric of the Bulgarian nation. That is our richness and makes us quite unique in the Balkans. That is why we cannot remain uninterested in developments in the Middle East  particularly with regard to the elusive prospects for peace between the people of Israel and the people of Palestine.  Over the course of the past year  we have seen the tireless efforts of the United States Administration and the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  Mrs. Catherine Ashton  trying to find a way to resume direct negotiations. Those efforts  including the agreed Quartet statement of today  need to be applauded  encouraged and supported by all. It was in the United Nations in 1947 that the State of Israel was born. It was born as a home for the Jewish people  a beacon of hope for a community that had been persecuted and oppressed for thousands of years. Today  the landscape is changing. Slowly but surely the region is moving towards democracy. Democracy  accountable government and the rule of law are ultimately in the long-term interests of all  Jews and Muslims  Arabs and Israelis.  The Palestinian people have a right to a State of their own. Indeed we  the international community  have an obligation to support the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza: a Palestine that lives side-by-side with the State of Israel  a Palestine that lives in security and mutual recognition with the State of Israel  a Palestine that has secure borders based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps.   Both Palestine  as the home of the Palestinian people  and Israel  as the home of the Jewish people  must guarantee that all ethnic and religious groups have full rights and protection under law. Let me also make one point very clear. To refuse the right of Israel to exist means to refuse the right of the Palestinian people to have a State of their own. I can accept criticism of the policies of any Government but I    11-51197 20  cannot stand idly by when the right of existence is denied to anyone  no matter what their religion or ethnicity is. To dismiss the importance of such policies would mean to fail the very values of our civilization. Bulgaria will never accept that  nor should any other nation in the global community.  Bulgaria believes very strongly that the definitive solution to peace can only come through direct negotiations  but direct negotiations can resume only on the basis of trust and a real understanding of the security concerns and legitimate aspirations of both sides. Rebuilding trust between both parties is a prerequisite to resuming negotiations. Unilateral action  changing the realities on the ground cannot be a substitute for negotiations.   Obstacles should be overcome  and preconditions should be removed. If the leaders of Palestine believe that the settlement policy is an obstacle to peace  the leaders of Israel must refrain from such activities in order to give peace a chance. If the leaders of Israel believe that no preconditions to a final settlement should be put in place  then the Palestinian leaders must refrain from such actions to give peace a chance.   Bulgaria recognized the Palestinian State in 1988. We hold our friendship with both Israel and the Palestinian people dear. That is why we urge the immediate resumption of negotiations as the only road to peace. Bringing both sides to the negotiating table remains our top priority. I am sure that the United States  working in concert with the European Union  can facilitate this process based on a vision outlined by President Obama.  Allow me to turn briefly to my delegation’s vision for the kind of leadership  the kind of United Nations we need for the next decade. An Organization created by 51 Member States functions today with 193 Members.  In order for the United Nations to be adequate to the challenges facing it today its institutions need to be reformed  first and foremost in the composition of the United Nations main body that guarantees international peace and security. We must build on the progress achieved so far in the negotiations on Security Council reform and move the process to a more results-oriented phase. Bulgaria considers that enlargement of the Council’s two categories of permanent and non-permanent members is one option that enjoys the support of a considerable number of delegations. The increase in the number of non-permanent seats should provide for a just representation of the Eastern European Group  whose membership has more than doubled over the past two decades.  Transparency is impossible without accountability. First  the United Nations must be accountable to its Member States through a continued striving to improve management and the enforcement of strict budgetary discipline  especially in the current period of economic turmoil. We  the Member States  must also be accountable to the United Nations by fulfilling all our commitments  including by paying our financial contributions to the Organization fully  unconditionally and on time — a principle that Bulgaria upholds and adheres to closely.  We all also need to be accountable to future generations for our actions. It is easy to speak of sustainable development  but at the moment we are not even remotely close to making it a reality. On the contrary  the damage we have done to the planet’s geology  climate and ecosystems for most of the last century is so significant that scientists are increasingly asserting that the human race has actually managed to push the Earth much faster than usual into a new  possibly more unstable and dangerous geological period.  We need both wise and courageous leadership from the United Nations in our efforts to guarantee peace and security — wise  so as to avoid the temptation to use force when it seems to get results faster than mediation and negotiation  and courageous  to take responsibility when the use of force is a must. The United Nations will benefit much from strengthening its cooperation with regional security organizations. The cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Afghanistan is an excellent example. International support has to continue beyond 2014 for Afghanistan. We were all saddened by the brutal murder of a great Afghan leader  former President Rabbani. His work must inspire us to continue supporting the Afghan Government’s efforts to achieve reconciliation and reintegration.   It is high time for bold and decisive actions in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation as well. It is the legal and moral obligation of all of us to honour the commitments undertaken under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the outcome document of the 2010 Review Conference. A   21 11-51197  strengthened and robust NPT regime is in the interest of all States  especially with the growing risk of non-State actors getting access to weapons of mass destruction. All States Parties  including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are bound by the NPT regime. Leaving the NPT should not be without consequences. Cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also essential. As long as Iran continues not to provide greater transparency with regard to of its nuclear activities  the concerns of the international community will remain valid. Full compliance with Security Council resolutions and with the provisions of the IAEA safeguards agreement is crucial for a diplomatic solution of this case.  The sad anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York  which we commemorated this year  the more recent tragic events in Oslo  the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and other cities of the world prove that terrorism is a global cancer that does not   discriminate against developed or developing countries and societies. Its eradication requires decisive action. The successful conclusion of the negotiations on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism has Bulgaria’s full support.   I began my statement by focusing on the challenge of tackling non-communicable diseases. Human suffering caused by various illnesses is further exacerbated owing to the effects of the series of global crises in food  finance and energy and the threats associated with climate change. Taken together  these and other new challenges impede progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We must be twice as vigilant as we have been until now. Our world today faces challenges that will shape its tomorrow. We need to be able to meet these challenges in a bold manner  with a clear vision for the future  and tackle them together as a global community of nations."
"18",737,"BHR",66,2011,"It gives us pleasure  at this international forum  to greet our brothers and friends  the Heads of State  Government and delegations represented in this Hall. We hope that our meetings at the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and result in a concrete outcome commensurate with our aspirations for a global environment of stability  security and lasting peace  and for the good and well-being of humanity at large.   We are pleased to see yet another diplomat from the Gulf Cooperation Council presiding over the General Assembly. We take this opportunity to offer our sincere wishes of every success to Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser in his international mission and of further progress and advancement at all levels for his country  the brotherly State of Qatar. We also thank his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his able conduct of and contributions to the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  We would also like to express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ceaseless efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security and for his persistent endeavours to achieve the prerequisites for stability in our world  namely  development and collective international cooperation for the benefit of the peoples of the world as a whole. We also seize this opportunity to congratulate him on his reappointment to a second term of office.  There is no doubt that the world has entered a new era of important changes in which the growth of modern means of communication has led to rapid and unprecedented transformations in the world  such as those that we are now experiencing in our Arab region. More than a decade ago  we in the Kingdom of Bahrain recognized the need to proceed towards greater reform  improvement and advancement  bearing in mind the supreme interest of our people  in order to satisfy their demands for freedom and political participation — a home-grown participation that is commensurate with the heritage and history of each country and its level of development. Reform was also aimed at providing decent living conditions  security and tranquillity in a society that enjoys peaceful coexistence  equality and equal opportunities for empowerment to achieve justice and sustainable development for all.  In all its modernization endeavours and throughout its long history  the Kingdom of Bahrain has persistently followed the approach of dialogue. Building on the consensus of the people of Bahrain around the provisions of the National Action Charter of 2001  we initiated a national dialogue process involving all sectors and components of the population. The aim was to absorb the requirements of modern progress  guarantee the continuation of the reform process  and fulfil the national aspiration to move forward towards comprehensive modernization and the enhancement of popular participation in decision-   11-50865 8  making within an all-inclusive national partnership. We hereby reaffirm our support for the outcome of that dialogue.  The achievements of the Kingdom of Bahrain at the national level are therefore an extension of a long history dating back to the beginning of the last century  in which we have worked to achieve a society based on justice  equality  progress and openness. The authenticity of our people  culture  free economy  political development and firm commitment to the universal principles of human rights  peaceful coexistence and respect for the views of others constitute the real wealth of our country  which we seek to preserve and sustain for future generations.  Today more than ever  the international community has a propitious opportunity to do justice to the brotherly Palestinian people and to help them to achieve their legitimate aspirations by recognizing an independent Palestinian State on their own national soil  with East Jerusalem as its capital. That would put an end to an era of bitter Arab-Israeli conflict  contingent on a complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories to the lines of 4 June 1967 in Palestine  the occupied Syrian Arab Golan and the occupied territories in southern Lebanon  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative.  Committed to the security of the Arabian Gulf region  we emphasize the need to resolve the issue of the three occupied United Arab Emirates islands  either through direct negotiations or by referral to the International Court of Justice. With regard to developments in the brotherly State of Yemen  the Kingdom of Bahrain supports the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative for maintaining the security  stability and unity of that country and achieving the aspirations of its people. In this connection  we further emphasize the importance of preserving the unity of Moroccan territory and of resolving the issue of the Moroccan Sahara  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.  Consistent with its commitment to concerted international action and its role and responsibilities in our region  the Kingdom of Bahrain has never hesitated to contribute to and participate in the Contact Group on Libya in order to help realize the aspirations of the Libyan people and ensure the country’s unity and territorial integrity.  Bahrain is also participating in the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan in order to support that country’s stability and security in every sphere —political  economic and security — as well as in the fight against international terrorism and piracy on the high seas. Bahrain also shares in the friendly American people’s heartfelt pain and grief over the reprehensible terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Their resilience and determination  however  have helped to make their country a safer place.  As a peace-loving nation  Bahrain will remain faithful to this Organization for its historic role in supporting our country’s sovereignty  and for the role of its judiciary in ending inter-State disputes all over the world  all in the interest of global stability and development.  We believe that humankind in general and the international community have much to gain at the global level from the contributions of Arab-Islamic civilization  as have other civilizations throughout history. Arab Muslims  Christians  Jews and other followers of other religions and beliefs can coexist only in a state of civility based on tolerance. We speak here in light of the experience of our country  Bahrain  which  with its characteristic openness and civilization deeply rooted in history  has from time immemorial been a symbol of coexistence and interaction between these human contributions. Hence its position since early times as a cultural and spiritual centre in its natural and human environment in the Arabian Gulf — a position on which it has built a civil society and fomented a modern renaissance in the areas of administrative organization  economic activity  and an educational and cultural enlightenment.  While Bahrain appreciates the support of the United Nations and its specialized agencies for its achievements  as evidenced by the numerous awards it has won in various human and social fields  we stress the great importance of the global issues discussed in the Secretary-General’s annual report on the work of the Organization (A/66/1). We are convinced that it is imperative that all Member States cooperate on issues such as climate change  international health  drought  poverty alleviation  disarmament  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the fight against terrorism. This is more urgent than ever before  given the scale of the challenges and problems facing humankind  so that we can create a new world of security  peace  tranquillity and prosperity.   9 11-50865   In conclusion  we reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and its constructive role in consolidating peace  love and prosperity in the world."
"19",775,"BHS",66,2011,"On behalf of the people and the Government of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of my delegation’s full support and cooperation. I also extend gratitude to his predecessor for his stewardship of the Assembly during its sixty-fifth session  and I would also like to extend congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-election as Secretary-General.  I also take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome the Republic of South Sudan as the 193rd State Member of the United Nations and to convey the best wishes of my Government and people for its peace and prosperity.  On behalf of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I wish to express regret at the loss of life and the tremendous and wide-ranging destruction caused by hurricanes and tropical storms during the summer season. The Bahamas  as well as a number of Caribbean islands and  indeed  the East Coast of the United States  were particularly hard-hit by Hurricane Irene. The devastation caused by each of those storms reinforces the need for global attention to the adverse impacts of climate change and natural disasters. The storms’ trail of destruction  which took lives  flattened homes and businesses  toppled trees and spread debris across roadways and bridges  and which  in some cases  caused almost certain irreversible damage to coastal areas and ecosystems  compels  we believe  the international community to take immediate measures to address climatic phenomena which cause such huge losses and which threaten so many countries.  For us  the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters  including hurricanes  some due to the effects of climate change  are among the major challenges faced at the national level. Other environmental challenges  including waste and water-resource management issues  together with economic and social challenges  all constitute serious constraints for the Bahamas.  We are committed to mainstreaming sustainable development principles into our national development strategies. Progress is being made in the key areas of protecting our biodiversity and supporting the development of policies promoting renewable energy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with international partners so as to achieve even greater success in the years ahead. In this vein  the Bahamas looks forward to next year’s United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. We fully expect that the Conference will take into account unmet needs in connection with each of the three pillars of sustainable development  that is  economic  social and environmental.  We face an increasingly complex set of global challenges  which has given rise to an equally complex network of formal and informal global institutions and mechanisms designed to enhance collective action to address these challenges. Consequently  the question of international governance as it relates to the global agenda has become a pressing issue in recent years.  The global economic crisis of the past three years has underscored the need for more effective global governance  as has the long and sometimes controversial debate on reform of the Security Council. Arguably  at the heart of all of these issues  particularly for some small developing States such as the Bahamas  is the need to ensure that our global systems are able to effectively respond to evolving global challenges in an inclusive  participatory and transparent manner.    11-51384 34   With respect to international economic governance  the Bahamas is acutely aware of the growing role of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the need to address how the Group would be better able to engage and consult a wider range of countries  as well as the United Nations as a whole  with a view to helping to translate G-20 deliberations into effective actions on a global scale. Fortunately  the work of the Global Governance Group has been largely successful in this regard. Indeed  the Bahamas joined the Group with the understanding that the United Nations has a central role in global economic governance and that serious engagement with the G-20 would allow for a clearer understanding of their respective strengths and comparative advantages.  Reform of the Security Council is no more a reality today than it was a year ago  or even 10 years ago. This remains  however  an important goal  as it stands as a harbinger of success for other equally pressing global governance activities that will inevitably affect each and every country regardless of its size  economic or political power. The aspirations of the marginalized for greater democratization  inclusiveness  representativeness  transparency and accountability are no less legitimate at the international level than they are at the national or local levels. If the Council is to fully fulfil its responsibility for international peace and security  it must reflect the geopolitical realities of our world in its composition as well as in its modus operandi. The Bahamas therefore continues to support Security Council expansion in both categories and the reform of its working methods.  The Bahamas believes that the main strength of the United Nations is its inclusiveness  as it is perhaps the only global body with unquestionable legitimacy. Hence  we envision a greater role for the United Nations in a number of areas  not in order to duplicate work done elsewhere  but to help in other areas of critical importance to small developing countries  including international cooperation in tax matters.  The Bahamas  along with many Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries  continues to seek the conversion of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation on Tax Matters into an intergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council  the central goal being to give small developing countries an effective voice when issues of cooperation on tax matters are being decided by the international community. Likewise  we recommend a greater role for the United Nations in the areas of international financial regulation and credit-rating systems.  As regards the global economic and financial crisis  it is important to note that many small middle-income and ostensibly high-income developing States such as the Bahamas continue to grapple with lingering effects  including serious credit and employment challenges — challenges that persist owing mainly to indebtedness; non-concessionary status with respect to access to resources of the international financial institutions; and an increasing rate of erosion of preferential access to the markets of major development partners.  The Bahamas continues to develop national initiatives to address these and other related matters. We have seen some success in maintaining a sustainable of Government debt to gross domestic product ratio; implementing measures to provide relief and assistance to Bahamians; and efforts to modernize and expand our public infrastructure as well as increase investment in our least developed islands.  These national efforts must be met with appropriate and urgent actions at the international level in order to effectively respond to these challenges  as well as to help sustain progress in achieving the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. Such actions at the international level must include the provision of new and additional resources to assist developing countries  in particular the most vulnerable among us  as well as the development of the necessary implementation mechanisms.  In that connection  the Bahamas wishes to underline the importance of implementing the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development. The Bahamas also wishes to highlight in this regard the critical role that a universal  rules-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development in developing countries.  Migration can be  and has been  a positive force for development internationally. Indeed  immigrants have contributed to the development of the Bahamas in many respects  largely through contributions to education  health care and to the development of our tourism and financial services. Uncontrolled migration    35 11-51384  however  has also proved  and continues to be  a serious challenge to sustainable development. In this context  the Bahamas welcomes increased dialogue on improving international cooperation with respect to international migration and development. We believe that proper cooperation can help to ensure that migration occurs through safe and regulated channels  to the benefit of both migrant and receiving States  like the Bahamas. The Bahamas will continue to participate constructively in the process leading to the second High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  to be held by the General Assembly in 2013  with a view to addressing these and other related issues.  The Bahamas congratulates the people of Haiti on the election and installation of a democratically elected President and Government. We are heartened by the peaceful and successful manner in which the second round of elections was concluded in Haiti. Political stability is fundamental to Haiti’s economic and social development. We hope that the issue of the appointment of a new Prime Minister will be resolved in the shortest possible time so that the Haitian people can continue to recover from last year’s devastating earthquake and reconstruct their country with a view to its sustained and sustainable development.  My delegation continues to commend the work of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Over the years  MINUSTAH has played a key role in helping to lay the foundation for long-term recovery and stability in Haiti  with its support activities for State institutions and the rehabilitation and training of the Haitian National Police. MINUSTAH’s role and functions should reflect the country’s development needs  as articulated by the Government. The support and engagement of the international community in Haiti is as pressing and urgent as ever  and MINUSTAH must continue to be an important factor in this regard.  The issue of international peace and security remains a critical concern for the Organization  as it does for the entire global community. The Bahamas unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterates its commitment to the fight against it. The terror attacks of 11 September  the heinous attacks in Mumbai and Norway and at the United Nations headquarters in Nigeria demonstrate that our efforts thus far have proved insufficient; hence the urgency of our task.  In an archipelago spread over some 100 000 square miles  the porous borders of the Bahamas have  for many years  posed a challenge to national security as well as the rule of law. We are currently confronted by high levels of crime  too many of which involve the use of small arms and light weapons. We are keenly aware of the global threats posed by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  which is linked to other aspects of transnational organized crime  including the illicit drug trade.  The Bahamas  both nationally and internationally  is acting to reduce the threats that these criminal elements pose to our society. Nationally  we are continuing a programme of reform of our criminal laws  modernizing and expanding our court system and strengthening targeted programmes designed to address social ills. Regionally  we are working with other CARICOM nations to undertake a number of measures to combat these challenges. Internationally  the Bahamas is committed to the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.  Regulation of the import  export and transfer of conventional arms is critical if we are to achieve some measure of peace and stability and reduce conflicts. The Bahamas supports a strong  effective and non-discriminatory arms trade treaty and welcomes the inclusion of the category of small arms and light weapons and ammunition within the scope of a future treaty. What is clearly evident is the need for an integrated global response to supplement actions at the national  regional and subregional levels if we are to effectively prevent  combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  and thus reduce the escalating violence and crime in our societies.  The Government of the Bahamas continues to be committed to the 2001 and 2006 Declarations on HIV/AIDS (resolutions S-26/2 and 60/262). Our programme  now in its twenty-fifth year  has been very successful. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our regional  hemispheric and international partners for their support.  My Government is also dealing with the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  which pose an increasing threat to countries like the Bahamas and others of the CARICOM subregion. As our Prime Minister said in his national    11-51384 36  address here last week (see A/66/PV.3)  the health and socio-economic costs required for Governments to treat NCDs are indeed enormous. The Bahamas and its fellow CARICOM countries welcome last week’s High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases  and applaud the international community’s attention to NCDs. We trust that the adoption of the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2  annex)  while it is not as action-oriented as we envisaged when we undertook the mandate from our heads of Government four years ago  will produce results. We would have preferred the text to have reflected stronger commitments and specific  time-bound targets for addressing non-communicable diseases and their risk factors. We look forward  however  to a comprehensive review of this issue in 2014.  With the world community witnessing an unprecedented wave in the call for social change and democracy across countries in the Arab world and in North Africa  we must ensure  in our desire to promote good and effective governance  that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as the promotion of civil and political rights and the right to development  forms the basis of any long-term solution. My Government’s commitment to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms is unwavering.  This year we celebrate some significant achievements on the international human rights agenda: the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Right to Development (resolution 41/128) and  more recently  the tenth anniversary  this week  of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. This year  we are also observing the International Year for People of African Descent.  In spite of the objectives of these laudable initiatives for the advancement of the international human rights agenda and recent undertakings such as the reform of the Human Rights Council  we are still confronted with persistent poverty and stark inequalities  both within and across countries — racism  racial discrimination and related intolerance  some 63 years after the landmark adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (resolution 217 (III)). These challenges serve as a constant reminder that we have much more to do to improve the lives of millions of disadvantaged and marginalized populations throughout the world. While it is advantageous to adopt declarations and renew commitments  it is more important to ensure their effective implementation at the national  regional and international levels. The United Nations must therefore continue to reflect the ideals of its founding principles and unite us through a common vision of peace  mutual respect and human rights for all. "
"20",800,"BIH",66,2011,"It is my great honour to address the General Assembly today in my capacity as the Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Allow me  at the very outset  to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser upon his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  as well as the members of the Bureau  and to express our full support for your future work. Furthermore  I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on the results achieved when he presided over the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  in a period when this body and the international community in general were facing an array of challenges stemming from current global issues.  I am especially honoured to extend congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his unanimous re-appointment as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Over the past five years  Mr. Ban has worked tirelessly to address the various issues facing the Organization. We expect that the Secretary-General will continue to pursue these activities during his second term.  Allow me to express my gratitude for all the cooperation and the support we have received during Bosnia and Herzegovina’s membership in the Security Council  which will expire in a few months. Speaking of our membership in the Security Council  let me once again reiterate the view that the presence and participation of small States such as Bosnia and Herzegovina in the work and decisions of the Security Council is particularly important for maintaining balance within it. Accordingly  other countries  along with the Security Council’s permanent members and the world Powers  also have the opportunity to express their views and participate in Security Council decision-making on important issues of international peace and security. It has been our pleasure and honour to work together with all members of the Security Council during the term of our membership  2010-2011.  Bosnia and Herzegovina had the honour to preside over the Security Council in January 2011. Although acting as President was only one segment of the two-year experience in the Council  Bosnia and Herzegovina once again proved that it can be an equal partner on the international diplomatic scene and respond to a variety of obligations.   Bosnia and Herzegovina has played a constructive role in the work of the Security Council by contributing to the Council’s better  more effective and faster response to situations with the potential to   13 11-50702  threaten international peace. Furthermore  Bosnia and Herzegovina has also sought to share its own experiences in post-conflict peacebuilding and contribute actively to better and long-lasting understanding and reconciliation. Through its role in the Council  Bosnia and Herzegovina showed that it can be an equal and competent partner in international relations.  The Security Council thematic debate (see S/PV.6472) entitled “Post-conflict peacebuilding: institution-building”  which was initiated by Bosnia and Herzegovina  reached a number of conclusions. I would like to mention some of them.  In the interests of the success of peacebuilding initiatives  priority must be given to institution-building. so as to prevent a return to conflict and ensure the survival  renewed credibility and legitimacy of States. The purpose of institution-building is to progressively reduce dependence on the international community and promote sustainability. Ownership of the reform process is the main condition for the establishment of effective institutions and for ensuring sustainable peace.  Success in post-conflict institution-building depends primarily on establishing partnerships between the international community and post-conflict societies  a partnership that is based on a set of common goals. Bearing that in mind  we would like once again to thank the Assembly for the confidence its members have shown and for the support they have provided during our membership in the Security Council.   Bosnia and Herzegovina also continues to provide concrete contributions to the United Nations peace operations in Liberia  the Sudan  Cyprus and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina  we are united in our determination to move towards full membership in the European Union (EU); our unity provides a solid basis for the achievement of this goal.  Bosnia and Herzegovina places special emphasis on regional and subregional cooperation and dialogue between neighbouring countries in the Balkans  with their different cultures and traditions that have been present for centuries. We are committed to future cooperation with our neighbours  based on the principles of mutual respect and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are interested in sharing our experiences with others and in developing mutually beneficial relations in post-conflict peacebuilding  based on mutual respect for differences  which  in our opinion  represent an advantage.  I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize that the issues of neighbourly and regional cooperation are closely related to the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the EU and NATO  which is a strategic and high-priority foreign policy objective for my country. We believe that this is the best and only way to ensure stability  security  economic development and prosperity for all citizens of Bosnia.   The strategic goal of establishing formal relations and EU membership is based on the aspiration of Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve the full functioning of our own institutions and the further development of society  on the basis of the principles of a free market  the rule of law and  especially  the protection of human rights.  Furthermore  my country wishes to improve its relations with the States of Asia  Africa  Latin America  Australia and the wider region  at the multilateral and bilateral level  in accordance with common interests and real possibilities. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains dedicated to the principle of openness in cooperation with all countries of the world.  Many important world events have occurred since the previous session of the General Assembly. Bosnia and Herzegovina is following with great attention  preoccupation and concern the development of the situation in the friendly Arab countries that are affected by deep social and political changes. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports democratic processes aimed at the creation of free  democratic and prosperous societies. However  such processes are often followed by tragic consequences  and we therefore appeal once again for the violence to stop and for peace to be achieved in those societies.  We are deeply concerned by the standstill in crisis resolution in the Middle East. Despite the optimistic announcements and plans made  the peace process has not yet been revived  as had been expected. The only way forward is a solution that is based on the principle of the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign States: a viable and independent Palestine and a stable and secure Israel  with respect for the provisions of    11-50702 14  international law and humanitarian law and human rights instruments.  To date  the United Nations has supported and actively participated in the creation of a positive atmosphere in order to reach a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that the conditions for a lasting and just solution can be achieved with additional political will and responsibility on the part of the negotiating parties.  We are witnesses to the fact that the international community’s determination to deal with terrorism and  at the same time  create conditions conducive to the peaceful development of Afghanistan has yielded results. However  we cannot but conclude that it will take much greater efforts to establish self-sustaining peace and stability in Afghanistan. In April 2010  as a sign of support for the activities of the international community  Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision on the sending of an infantry unit to the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan.  I would like to emphasize here that Bosnia and Herzegovina is still very concerned about terrorist attacks  which claim innocent civilian lives in many countries around the world. Bearing in mind the fact that the modern world continues to face various forms of international terrorism  I express our support for the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. In that regard  let me reiterate that Bosnia and Herzegovina is unconditionally dedicated to the fight against terrorism and is particularly active in cooperating with the countries of our region to increase security and enhance preparedness for the effective prevention of terrorist acts. Completing negotiations and adopting a United Nations comprehensive convention against terrorism would be an important contribution in this field.  In addition to the political crisis  this year we are faced once again with many other problems to which the international community still lacks proper and effective responses. Despite signs of recovery  the greatest economic and financial crisis in recent history has  unfortunately  left visible consequences that are having repercussions on global peace and security. It is clear that countries individually cannot cope with this issue  no matter how efficient their Governments may be. Global crises require global solutions.  In the context of the activities of the United Nations  we must face the fact that the greatest economic crisis since the foundation of the world Organization has to some degree threatened and even begun to bring into question the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  one of the most comprehensive strategic tasks set by the Organization since its establishment.  Therefore  it is necessary to do everything in our power  individually and collectively  in order to prevent any further erosion of this key strategic project. We believe that it is necessary for the international community  especially the United Nations  to redouble its efforts to assist primarily the least developed countries.  The climate change problem caused by human activity is leading to changes in the environment that could have catastrophic consequences for humankind as a whole if the process of reaching agreement on environmental protection is not intensified.  Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the concern of the most States Members of the United Nations at the fact that drought  floods  sea-level rise  lack of running water and food  deforestation and all the other phenomena caused by global warming pose a serious threat to global security  which in future could be a cause of conflict throughout the world. The extremely important issue of climate change therefore requires urgent action by the international community. Bosnia and Herzegovina has expressed interest in joining the countries that support the Copenhagen Accord; thus our country has joined the large number of States Members of the United Nations that consider that Accord to be a necessary step in relation to Kyoto until the achievement of a final  legally binding agreement.  Bearing this in mind  I believe that neither economic nor political interests should stand in the way of achieving a global consensus as the beginning of the global and common struggle to preserve the natural balance of the planet. It is often forgotten that climate change has a direct effect in terms of development  poverty and hunger  and  consequently  global peace and security. I am convinced that it is in our common interest to ensure that future generations inherit the best possible world on our common home  planet Earth.   15 11-50702   I hope that all of us who are here today agree that comprehensive United Nations reform is necessary; such reform must be carried out with extreme care  with the broadest possible consensus on the part of Member States. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the role of the United Nations and its agencies as central to resolving key issues of international significance. Therefore  it supports the Secretary-General’s efforts and proposals for reform.  United Nations reform should lead to the efficient and coordinated functioning of all agencies and bodies of the United Nations system  bearing in mind the need to avoid any duplication of activities in the context of a more rational allocation of financial resources.  Regardless of the future configuration of the Security Council  we believe that the Eastern European group of countries must have another non-permanent seat  taking into account the fact that in the past two decades the number of countries in this group has more than doubled.  While presiding over a subsidiary body of the Security Council — the Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Questions — Bosnia and Herzegovina set the consideration of the working methods and transparency of the Security Council as a primary goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina also organized several informal meetings in cooperation with partner countries and the General Assembly  at which States Members of the United Nations expressed their opinions and views and put forward concrete proposals for improving the efficiency of the Security Council.  I wish to emphasize in particular that it is expected that the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  be more active in the area of preventive diplomacy. We believe that in order to make the work of the Council more efficient  greater activity in this respect would provide a starting point for resolving many of the world’s problems and crises before they flare up. Providing timely and effective conflict prevention  rather than reacting once the crisis has escalated  is certainly a more efficient and less expensive mechanism for preserving peace and security.  During the six decades of its existence  the United Nations has undergone ordeals but it always was and still is the best framework for seeking and providing adequate responses to the wide range of global issues that we face. Therefore  I urge Member States to work for the full implementation of all our agreements in order to make the world a better place for our future generations."
"21",847,"BLR",66,2011,"Much has been said from this rostrum in recent years about global governance. Yet in fact there is a pervasive feeling that chaos is inexorably engulfing our planet. Indeed  one global crisis comes hard on the heels of another. International law is being shamelessly trampled. Inequality and poverty are on the rise  and above all  an ever increasing number of people in the world are exposed to suffering.  This is the logical outcome of the world operating without a system and order. Twenty years ago  the international community had its own constitutional moment as a result of the end of an epochal confrontation  an opportunity to elaborate a comprehensive strategy for stable development of the world in the future. We missed that opportunity  first of all because egoism and gloating rather than common sense took the upper hand in the mindset of the so-called winners.  The lack of common vision excluded the possibility of our taking effective concerted action. As a result  the international community today is only reacting to ever-rising global challenges  having no recourse to instruments that might prevent them. The situation is bound to persist unless we arrive together at a set of long-term  efficient measures. We need a global strategy against chaos.  The failures of the international community over the past twenty years suggest that for such a strategy to become a strategy for success  it would have to be built around the following three foundations: strengthening international law  establishing global partnerships and revitalizing the United Nations.  The history of mankind has always been the history of the opposition of power and law. Only in the past century has that argument been resolved  and only de jure  in favour of the latter. By the way  it is hardly an exaggeration to say that a civilization is shaped by its transition from power to law.  Belarus is firmly convinced that a strategy against chaos cannot succeed if we fail to preserve and strengthen the system of international law as a deterrent against lawlessness and impunity. Clearly  there is more than enough reason to be concerned  since power  de facto  dominates law more often than not.   This year we have witnessed far-reaching changes in the Middle East. The countries of that region have the inalienable right to determine their own way of development. All of us must respect the choice made by those States and refrain from interfering in their internal affairs. That is our international obligation as Member States of the United Nations.  Unfortunately  not every country complies with its international obligations concerning the free choice of development paths. For decades the United States of America has maintained an economic  trade and financial blockade against freedom-loving Cuba. That is a clear violation of United Nations principles and decisions.   11 11-51670   Belarus has also found itself the target not only of malicious attacks but also of economic sanctions for the choice that the Belarussian nation made with the election of its own President. Belarussians will never renounce their right of choice. Determining our own path of development is a sacred value to us. Neither sanctions nor blackmail and threats will alter our stance. Justice is on our side.  Belarus has never tried to teach anyone how to live. We consistently advocate the need to respect the diverse development paths of the world’s nations. The Republic of Belarus stands ready to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries  even those with whom we continue to have acute differences. After all  we are simply asking that others treat us as we treat them  with respect and equality. That is our right too.  The great Albert Einstein once said: “Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.” The growing transnational challenges and threats cannot be successfully addressed through traditional foreign policy tools such as balance of power  spheres of influence  sanctions and threats. We need new forms of cooperation that factor in the two contemporary global shifts that foreign policy analysts correctly emphasize: from the West to the rest  and from States to non-State actors.  We believe that global partnerships among States  international organizations  civil society and the private sector represent the best form of cooperation for facing those and any other challenges.  Global partnerships constitute an integral part of the strategy against chaos. It is just such partnerships that can ensure a real pooling of efforts by interested stakeholders in today’s world in order to oppose the whole array of challenges and threats that recognize no borders. We are certain that at the international level there is no alternative to integration and inclusiveness. Globalization and interdependence have made all of us equally vulnerable to transnational problems. Thus  there cannot be well-being and stability in the world for the few while others live in poverty and suffering.   The profound changes in Africa and the Middle East caused by the growing problems of poverty and inequality dictate the need to achieve a global partnership for development. Last year’s High-level Meeting at the United Nations and the Seoul Meeting of the Group of 20 made important contributions to the efforts in this field. At the same time  the relentless rise of oil  food and energy prices across the globe points out a new strain on development  hence the need for more proactive and unconventional approaches.  Among such specific approaches  we consider it important to address the issue of the transfer of effective  cutting-edge energy technologies to developing and middle-income countries. That is also a key element for overcoming the problems of climate change. What is crucial here is that such technologies already exist and are established in many parts of the globe. Therefore  the difficulties are not technical.   Ultimately  let us grasp one point: today it is impossible to have a green paradise for the affluent countries while the poor ones live in a contaminated hell. The finite nature of Earth rules out such a scenario.   As a practical step  Belarus would like to suggest setting up a global mechanism — through a General Assembly resolution on new and renewable sources of energy and under the outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference — under the aegis of the United Nations to ensure access to modern energy technologies for all countries of the world. That would be our best contribution to the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All that we are to celebrate in 2012.  Over the past year  we have made important strides in forging the Global Partnership against Slavery and Trafficking in Human Beings in the Twenty-first Century  initiated by Belarus. The implementation of the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons is under way. Interested States  international organizations and civil society  along with the private sector  are already actively participating in the process. It is gratifying that these efforts have focused on protecting the rights of victims.   Throwing its full weight behind such an approach  Belarus was among the first States to make a voluntary contribution to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking. We are grateful to those countries that joined in the work of the Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking.  Among the prospects for establishing global partnerships  we see as highly promising the theme of supporting youth. At the Assembly’s High-level Meeting on Youth last year  Belarus came up with the initiative to create a partnership to that effect. We    11-51670 12  welcome the High-level Meeting on Youth held in July this year in the context of the International Year of Youth. We hope that the event will be followed by the development of efficient global policies to protect the interests of youth.  There is a natural place where a strategy for development for the future must be devised and implemented. That place is the United Nations. The question today is  to what extent is the United Nations fit to take this task upon itself? Let us be frank. We all have claims against the United Nations. Indeed  the major task of the Organization over the past years seems to have been to survive various crises rather than to solve  let alone prevent  them.   Is the United Nations to blame for this state of affairs? Let us be outspoken once more and say “No”. The United Nations is us. It is us  the Member States  who are at fault  because together we failed both to grasp what kind of world we wanted to build and to adjust the United Nations to the new realities. Therefore  it is hardly surprising that the United Nations has more frequently served as a stage for individual actors rather than as a platform for common action.  The need to revitalize the Organization stands out sharply as never before. We need to reform the principal organs of the United Nations and the fundamental orientation of its activities.  The Security Council should not stay fixed in a form that was appropriate in era of realpolitik. In the interests of developing countries above all  we are convinced that the Council must be enlarged in both categories. Bringing the Council’s working methods into conformity with the spirit of the age must serve to enhance the authority and efficiency of its work.  The world is plagued by severe economic problems  yet the substantial economic capacities of the United Nations have not been properly utilized. The activities of the Economic and Social Council should be aligned with solutions to the urgent problems of Member States to a much greater extent than they are now. Belarus is eager to contribute to this work  including as member of the Council  provided that next month Member States do Belarus the honour of electing it to that vital United Nations body.  Strengthening the United Nations is impossible without striking a balance among the interests of various groups of countries. Several years ago  Belarus was among the Member States that initiated efforts to have the General Assembly pay greater attention to the problems of middle-income countries. We are glad to see that since then there has been a growing understanding of the significance of that group of countries in world political and economic processes. At the current session Belarus  together with like-minded countries  will continue efforts to guide United Nations organs conducting operational activities towards a more robust and efficient response to the specific needs of that group of countries and its many members.  The authority of the United Nations among the world’s ordinary people is high in places where it really helps in the transition from chaos and violence to order and stability through its peacekeeping activities. In our view  efforts to strengthen this domain demand the widest support. Responding to the request of the Secretary-General  Belarus started contributing as it could by taking part in peacekeeping operations.  There is also the need to enhance the mediation role of the United Nations in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. For that it is important not only to build up the Organization’s internal capacities  but to ensure active United Nations cooperation with regional organizations  for instance the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)  which know best the problems in their own areas of responsibility. As the current Chair of the CSTO  Belarus stands ready to assist in this effort as much as it can.  Martin Luther King once said  “The time is always right to do what is right.” Let us heed this reasonable advice and  as the international community  do without delay what we must do."
"22",882,"BLZ",66,2011,"It is an honour for me to deliver this address on behalf of the people and the   19 11-51670  Government of Belize. It is a particular privilege to do so with Mr. Al-Nasser at the helm of the Assembly. I say so because Belize has the distinct pleasure of having him as the Ambassador of Qatar to Belize  a role in which he has distinguished himself and his nation  much as he is doing in his role as President of the Assembly.  Today’s world is characterized by disputes between neighbouring States which have resulted and continue to result in untold damage  loss of life and financial ruin to the feuding States. Thus Mr. Al-Nasser’s selection of the theme “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes” for this year’s general debate is a timely and appropriate one. We in Belize fully subscribe to the view that mediation is a much more sensible means of putting an end to disputes than the use of force or threats of force  especially in the case of neighbouring States whose people have to live side by side and who are often dependent upon one another for survival and security.  But today’s world is also characterized by widespread anxiety  insecurity  unrest  violence and instability. This is manifested in our financial markets as well as in the streets of cities in the developed and the developing world. Threats  both natural and man-made  appear to be proliferating. Debt crises are now so globalized that they are dwarfing national fiscal and policy space. Drugs  arms and human trafficking dominate the global stage  while Mother Nature is undergoing extreme changes  leaving death  destruction and disaster in her wake.  Thus far  unfortunately  international responses to these catastrophic occurrences have been both uninspiring and inadequate.  Notwithstanding the armoury of human rights that are enshrined in our own Human Rights Charter  far too many people are still destitute  are still dying from hunger  are still casualties of preventable or curable diseases  are still illiterate  are still jobless and are still marginalized and excluded from their very own societies.  Three years after the 2008 economic and financial crisis  the global economy is once again bracing for another setback  as the recovery in major industrialized economies stutters and risks a very real danger of reversal. Terrorism remains no less of a global threat. Mortality from non-communicable diseases now rivals mortality from communicable diseases. And greenhouse gas emissions continue to fuel global warming at a perilous rate.  Faced with the plethora of ills that now beset our world  we in Belize entertain no doubt that if any institution holds the key to solving the world problems it is this Organization  the United Nations  and its various agencies and institutions. Belize is therefore looking to the United Nations to lead the charge and to partner with us in combating three of the most serious threats that presently confront us  namely  the threat posed by climate change  the threat posed by crime and violence and the threat posed by chronic non-communicable diseases.  For small island and coastal States like Belize  global warming poses an existential threat. We have already been overwhelmed by the nature  scale and frequency of the damage that extreme weather conditions  triggered by global warming  have wrought on our infrastructure and marine and terrestrial organisms. While we appreciate that each of us is primarily responsible for our own welfare and we are taking such measures as are within our competence to cope with our changing circumstances  climate change is a global problem that requires a global response based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.  The President took the Chair.  To that end  some small island and coastal States  including Belize  are moving resolutely towards low-carbon and no-carbon emission economies. Today  24 of our small island developing States (SIDS) have become partners in an innovative  sustainable energy initiative called SIDS DOCK  aimed at transforming our energy sector and catalyzing our sustainable economic development. However  in order to succeed in our initiative we will require delivery or transfer of the often promised environmentally friendly technology and the new and additional funding promised by the international community.  In that regard  we consider the upcoming Durban Conference on climate change of high importance. We believe that every effort should be made at the Conference to forge a climate change regime that will incentivize significant emission reductions and the protection and preservation of existing forests  while simultaneously creating disincentives to polluting actions. Additionally  clear  legally binding rules must    11-51670 20  be hammered out with a view to guaranteeing the environmental integrity of our countries.  Over the last decade  crime and violence in Belize and the rest of Central America have escalated drastically  resulting in some 18 167 homicides. However  none of the arms used in those murders was produced in Central America. Those arms are the product of the illicit trafficking in guns and drugs between South and North America. The transnational nature of those crimes is exacerbated by cross-border collaboration among criminals. Confronting that type of criminal activity successfully will clearly require the collaboration and cooperation of the international community.  We in Belize have stepped up our national efforts  in conjunction with our neighbours in Central America  the Caribbean and the United States  to combat those criminal activities. But the going is difficult and progress is slow. We need more help from the international community. Ideally  we would need a universally applicable normative framework to regulate the trade in arms  such as an arms trade treaty that is legally binding  robust and comprehensive; one that establishes the highest possible standards for the transfer of conventional arms  especially small arms  light weapons and ammunition.  I now turn to some of the silent killers that are ravaging our Latin American and Caribbean communities — the chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  such as hyper-tension  diabetes and obesity. In the Caribbean today  NCDs are responsible for 62 per cent of deaths  40 per cent of which occur prematurely. If the current trend continues  non-communicable diseases will account for three out of four deaths in the Caribbean by the year 2030.   Again  those diseases can be combated effectively only through collaborative efforts of the international community. In that connection  we welcome the conclusion of the recently held High-level Meeting on non-communicable diseases (A/66/PV.3 and A/66/PV.4)  as well as the first comprehensive global political declaration addressing chronic non-communicable diseases (resolution 66/2). It should serve as a template for action at all levels. We will eagerly await the development of indicators and global targets aimed at achieving a 25 per cent reduction in non-communicable disease-related deaths by 2025. That will  no doubt  necessitate close collaboration and cooperation among Governments  international organizations  civil society and the private sector to facilitate access to medicines and healthy foods. Belize is committed to supporting that initiative unconditionally.  Belize is of the view that  given the quantum and scale of the problems which confront the world today and the unquestioned need for an ever-increasing amount of resources  the international community cannot afford not to avail itself of every source of assistance at hand. And in that regard  we wish to urge that the Republic of China  Taiwan  be allowed to participate meaningfully in the work of the United Nations. In a similar vein  we would urge that the embargo against Cuba  which the Assembly has denounced for many years  be brought to a speedy end.  Finally  while Belize appreciates the limitations of this United Nations  we also appreciate that there exists no better institution than this one  which is dedicated to world peace  security  justice and development. And even as we seek its reform  we recognize its primacy in international affairs and global governance. I am  therefore  pleased to assure you that Belize is fully committed to work within this Organization  through it and with it as it carries out its mandates."
"23",929,"BOL",66,2011,"Being present at this forum is very important to express what we think  what we feel and what we work on  but it is also important to express major differences between Presidents and between Governments  our differences on policies  programmes  projects    11 11-50847  principles and values with some countries in this world.  This morning we heard the statements of some Presidents  and I realized that there are enormous differences between the so-called small countries  developing countries  underdeveloped countries  compared with some Powers. For example  in the debate here at the United Nations there is a clear difference between the culture of life and the culture of death  between truth and falsehood and between peace and war.  Of course  we all have the right to have our differences. We have a right to deep differences about life  but I believe that our Organization  the United Nations  has a duty to make it possible to align the constant work of Governments to guarantee peace and the equality and dignity of all those living on plant Earth.  When I say that there is a deep difference between the culture of life and the culture of death  I feel that it will be difficult for us to come to an understanding with economic policies that concentrate capital in the hands of a few. Data show that 1 per cent of the world’s population holds 50 per cent of its wealth. If there are such deep differences  how can we resolve the problem of poverty? And if we cannot put an end to poverty how can we guarantee lasting peace?  Furthermore  imperialism seeks to control the sources of energy throughout the world  and to that end it has instruments to impose  control and constantly invade. And it is not just now; it has always been so. I remember when I was a child seeing rebellions of peoples against the capitalist system  against economic models that involved the permanent pillaging of our natural resources. Left-leaning union leaders and political leaders were accused of being Communists in order to arrest them. There was military intervention against social forces. People were confined  exiled  killed  persecuted and jailed  accused of being socialists  Maoists  Leninists and Marxist-Leninists.   I feel that that has ended. We are no longer accused of being Marxists or Leninists  but now drug-trafficking and terrorism are given as excuses. In countries with many natural resources  particularly related to energy  we are threatened by foreign intervention  when Presidents  Governments and peoples are not pro-capitalist or pro-imperialist.   And then there is talk about a lasting peace. How can there be a lasting peace where there are United States military bases? How can there be lasting peace when there are military interventions?  I believe that our United Nations is subordinate to the Security Council. What is the use of the United Nations if a group of countries decides on interventions  on killings? It is a Security Council for whom? It is a Security Council for Presidents  Governments  peoples who are pro-imperialist or pro-capitalist. But it is the Insecurity Council for Presidents  peoples or Governments who seek liberation — not only cultural liberation  but also economic liberation: the recovery of their economic resources. Those are the deep divisions between the Presidents from the various continents who are taking part in our debates.  If we want the Organization to have the authority to see that its resolutions are respected  we should think of founding afresh the United Nations. We cannot continue on the current footing.  Why do I say that? Every year at the United Nations  almost 100 per cent of the Member States — the United States and Israel being the exceptions — decide that the economic blockade of Cuba should be ended. Who ensures that that decision is respected? The Security Council will never ensure that such United Nations resolutions are respected; the United Nations cannot ensure respect for that decision of the whole world to lift the blockade against Cuba.   I cannot understand how the resolutions of an Organization of all the countries of the world are not respected. What  then  is the United Nations? It is time for an in-depth debate on founding afresh this great Organization  the largest in the world. We should debate its role so that the United Nations is recognized and respected by the peoples of the world. That can happen only with the re-establishment of the United Nations as a body which fights for the equality of all the inhabitants of planet Earth  for the dignity of all those whom we represent at the United Nations.  I have heard a number of interventions about Palestine. Of course  Palestine has our full support. Bolivia not only supports recognition of Palestine at the United Nations  but also wishes to welcome Palestine to the United Nations. Here I have a profound observation. When Israel bombs  attacks  kills and takes Palestinian land  there is no Security Council for    11-50847 12  that; there is no international organization that can stop those bombings and killings  the genocide in Palestine.  When there was a coup d’état in Honduras  where were the military bases to defend a President elected by the Honduran people? Where was the Security Council or the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to defend democracy in Honduras?  It is time for us to think deeply about this. When there are anti-imperialist Presidents with anti-capitalist Governments  the empire tries to create internal conflicts with what appear to be major confrontations  making it appear in the media that a certain President should fall  or it tries to divide a country to justify intervention.  When there was a coup d’état in Honduras and there were killings in Palestine  where was NATO? Where was the Security Council? They were nowhere to be found.  For those and many other reasons  it is important to think again about re-establishing the United Nations.  How can we Presidents and Governments face our responsibility of freeing our countries? Let me speak of some important aspects of my experience as President.  First  our natural resources can never be privatized. They can never be handed over to transnational companies  whether they be minerals  oil or other natural resources. Before I became President  hydrocarbons were in the hands of transnational companies. What did the contracts say? They declared that the owner assumed the right of ownership at the mouth of the well. Governments told us that as long as the resource — gas  oil — was underground it belonged to all Bolivians  but the minute it came out of the ground it belonged instead to the transnational companies. In the contracts they concocted the idea that the contract holder acquired ownership at the mouth of the well; as soon as the oil and gas came out of the ground they no longer belonged to Bolivians. That was a constant pillaging of our natural resources.  On 1 May 2006  we nationalized and recovered our natural resources through a supreme decree. From then on our national economy began to change. From then on Bolivia stopped being a beggar State. Before 2006 — I say this very sincerely — Bolivia was a small country sometimes considered an underdeveloped or developing country; it does not matter what term is used.   We have just 10 million inhabitants. Investment in Bolivia in 2005 was only $600 million  and more than 50 per cent of it was credits or international cooperation. Less than 50 per cent consisted of our own resources. How much investment has there been this year? The answer is $3.6 billion  with 20 per cent or 30 per cent of that being through international cooperation or credits  while almost 80 per cent is our own resources  thanks to our recovery of hydrocarbons  gas. How our economy has changed!  From 1948 until 2005 Bolivia never had a fiscal surplus; it was in deficit. In our first year in charge — 2006 — we achieved a fiscal surplus. We also created bonds for children and the elderly. We started to democratize our economy  apart from increasing investment. For the 180 years after Bolivia was founded in 1825  what international reserves did we have until 2005? The answer is $1.7 billion. Over 180 years  Governments of all kinds — liberal  military dictatorships  neo-liberal — were able to save for Bolivia only $1.7 billion. In less than six years we have saved over $10 billion; Bolivia now has $11.7 billion in international reserves.  In 2005  we were the next to last country in terms of international reserves. Now we have improved  thanks to the recovery and nationalization of hydrocarbons. Recovering natural resources  having them in the hands of the State  is very important for improving the economy; we cannot privatize natural resources and hand them over to the transnationals.   We can have partners. That is fine. But companies cannot be the owners of our natural resources. The State  the people  must be the owner. I mention this experience because thanks to our decision  responding to the call of the Bolivian people  we started to change the national economy.  I have a second point. Basic public services can never be provided by private businesses. I am speaking of water  energy  electricity and the telephone service. This morning  someone said that the prices of agricultural products are rising by 25 per cent or 30 per cent — even 50 per cent in some cases — and have been doing so for four or five years. Prices are going up because we do not yet control agricultural production. Since the State has controlled basic services in Bolivia  electricity  telephone and drinking   13 11-50847  water tariffs have not risen  because they are basic. Public utilities must be the responsibility of the State  and not of the private sector.  How can we allow water  the stuff of life  to be in private hands? I welcome the support we have received from the General Assembly for water to be a human right and express thanks on behalf of the people and Government of Bolivia. It is our responsibility to implement throughout the world the concept of water as a human right  thus supporting the least privileged when it comes to water.  My third point concerns the constant struggle of peoples for dignity and sovereignty. In Bolivia I too have to put up with a United States military base. And what do the uniformed United States outsiders do? They command the national police and the armed forces  because of political decisions of former Presidents  those who preceded me in the Palacio Quemada  as it is known in some sectors of society. The Chimore airport could not be used without the permission of the United States embassy. That woke us up to the importance of defending the dignity and sovereignty of our peoples.   What I have described gave rise to a great movement  not only social and cultural  but also electoral. It led to a political liberation movement  a movement to return dignity to all Bolivians  and to my attaining the presidency.  When I became President  I closed the military base. How is it possible in this new millennium  in the twenty-first century  for there still to be foreign military bases all around the world? How is it possible for there still to be interventions decided upon by the Security Council? That situation is a threat to humanity  an attack on the dignity of all the countries of the world. That is why we must develop proposals for the United Nations that will make it possible not only to free all the people living on this planet  but to restore dignity to them.  My fourth point concerns international financial institutions. I remember that when I was a union leader Governments could never obtain the resources for investment. We were told that Bolivia did not have the capacity to borrow. Bolivia did not have easy access to international loans. But what did the International Monetary Fund do? It made loans conditional. It told Governments that if they privatized refineries and telecommunications they would give credits of $30 million to $40 million.  A usurious bank  conditional credits and credits requiring security are no solution. No credits were given to States  or to the productive sector. They were all for services and trade. Above all  they went to the transnationals.  When I became President  one of the transnational oil companies told me that the Government would have to guarantee a credit of $100 million to build a pipeline. I wondered about the purpose. Finally  the oil company  Transredes  was conspiring politically  and we therefore decided to nationalize its properties — oil and gas pipelines. We expelled it. Then we began to invest through the State company  Yacimientos  without borrowing a single dollar  and the Carrasco Cochabamba pipeline is now under construction. But if the transnational had continued to be responsible  we would certainly have had to guarantee a loan for it.  As the Assembly is aware  I come from the indigenous peasant movement. When our families talk about a company  they think of it as something that has a lot of money and is made up of millionaires. So I could not understand how a company could ask the Government to lend it money for an investment.  The international financial institutions deal through companies  but who has to pay? It is the peoples  the States. So we must create other financial institutions. Fortunately  we are making good progress in South America. The Bank of the South will be completely different from the usurious banks that feather their own nests and make money through speculation. That must end. Regional integration will free us from the domination of those banks.  It is important for us to go further in that integration. In Bolivia we have barriers to overcome  and other countries of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) also have problems. For example  we have a historic demand upon Chile for a sovereign corridor to the Pacific. We decided to have recourse to international tribunals to ask for that access. Resolution 37/10 of 15 November 1982 establishes in its annex  the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  that recourse to an international tribunal to settle disputes between States should not be considered an unfriendly act.    11-50847 14   Bolivia has right and reason on its side in going to an international tribunal  because our landlocked state results from an unjust war  an invasion. For Bolivia  calling for a solution in the international sphere means for Bolivia redressing a historic injustice.  Bolivia is a friendly  peaceful State which gives priority to dialogue with its neighbours. We therefore keep open channels for bilateral negotiation with Chile  without  however  renouncing the right to go to an international court. There is regional involvement as well  since this is not just a bilateral problem  but is a regional problem as well.  Peoples are not responsible for the landlocked state of Bolivia. Those responsible are  as always  the oligarchies  the transnationals  which wish to protect their access to natural resources. The 1904 Treaty did not lead to either peace or friendship  because for more than a century Bolivia had no access to a sovereign port of its own. I take this opportunity to call on the United Nations  other international organizations and especially the region to support us  so that we can return with sovereignty to the Pacific Ocean.  In addition  there is another movement of countries taking place  that of the countries of Latin America with the Caribbean. I would say that it is a new Organization of American States  without the United States  in order to free us of certain impositions  with the benefit of our experience in UNASUR. I say that because we no longer find ourselves obliged  when there are conflicts between countries and within democracies  to have somebody coming from outside and above to re-establish order. Presidents and Governments meet to resolve internal problems. This is a great liberation for us.  I also take this opportunity to touch on a central topic: the fight against drug trafficking. United States imperialism is using the war on drugs for political ends. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Bolivia was not fighting drug trafficking; it was controlling it for political purposes. The DEA would implicate union leaders or anti-imperialist political leaders.   Many politicians have been saved from that dirty work of the empire in attempting to implicate us in drug trafficking  which still goes on. Last week some parts of the United States media said that my aircraft had been detained in the United States with traces of cocaine. How false! They are trying to confuse the people  trying to conduct a dirty campaign against my Government and against the State of Bolivia.  What does the United States do? It decertifies Bolivia and Venezuela. What moral authority does it have to certify or decertify nations of Latin America  when the United States is the world’s leading drug consumer  when the United States is one of the world’s producers of marijuana — in some years the biggest? What authority does it have to certify or decertify any country? This is another way of trying to scare countries or punish them.  However  Bolivia  very responsibly  continues to fight drug trafficking. A report by the State Department recognizes that there has been a net reduction in coca cultivation  with improved interdiction. Where is the market? The market is what drives drug trafficking  and the market is here. Who is decertifying the United States because it has not cut down the market? This morning President Calderón of Mexico said that the drug market continues to grow. Why is no responsibility taken for eliminating the market? As long as there is a market coca leaves and other products will be turned into drugs.  A great responsibility must be borne. Here I make an appeal. Let us fight with shared responsibility. Why do we not put an end to banking confidentiality? The biggest drug traffickers put their millions of dollars not in briefcases or backpacks but in the banks. Why is there fear of banking secrecy? In Bolivia we are not afraid. Banking confidentiality must be ended if we want to fight drug trafficking head on.  One of the crises on the margin of the crisis of capitalism is the food crisis. New international financial structures give opportunities to people with low incomes by providing microcredits to small producers. We have some experience in Bolivia  where credits at zero interest have been given to producers of rice  wheat  corn and soy at zero interest. Food producers can even pay their debts with their products. Soft credits are given to encourage food production.  Yet the international banks never take the small producer into account; they never pay any heed to cooperatives  to associations  which can very well contribute if given the chance.  There are new ways to encourage production through fair trade. We have to put an end to the so-called competitive market. In a competition who   15 11-50847  wins? It is the most powerful  those with the greatest advantages. Transnational companies are always the winners. The losers are the small producers  families wanting to rise through their own efforts. Therefore  we are trying in the region to implement policies of complementarity and solidarity  and not of competition. With naked competition we shall never be able to solve the problem of poverty.  Finally on this matter  the crisis of capitalism has no exit. When I was a young boy much mention was made of the foreign debt of poor countries. It was said that it could never be paid. Now the situation is quite the opposite: the debts of the poor countries can easily be settled  but the crisis of capitalism is a bottomless hole. The crisis of capitalism is not just because of circumstances; it is structural.  What do capitalist or imperialist countries do? They seek any pretext to invade a country and make off with its natural resources. This morning the President of the United States said that Iraq was already free and would govern itself. The Iraqis will be able to govern themselves  of course  but in whose hands is the oil now?   The fall of autocracy in Libya was hailed  and now there is democracy  but in whose hands is Libyan oil? The world and the Libyans have come to realize that reason for the invasion and the bombings was not to bring about the fall of Al-Qadhafi by rebels but a desire for Libyan oil. Next year we can review the situation and see which countries have their hands on Libyan oil.   There is a desire to overcome the crisis of capitalism by making off with our oil  gas and other natural resources. But we also have the great responsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth. I continue to be convinced that the best way to defend human rights is to defend the rights of Mother Earth.  Here we have the great responsibility of looking after the rights of Mother Earth. Only 60 years ago the Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it was only 60 years ago that the United Nations realized that the human being also has rights. After political rights  economic rights  the rights of indigenous peoples  now we have the enormous responsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth.  We are also convinced that infinite growth on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to growth is the regenerative capacity of the planet’s ecosystems. We therefore call for a new 10 commandments concerning social demands  financial systems  natural resources  basic services  production  and dignity and sovereignty. On that basis we should begin to re-establish the United Nations so that it can be the highest instance to settle issues of peace  poverty  dignity and sovereignty.  I hope that my experience as President of Bolivia will be useful to all those present. At the same time  I come to learn from many of them so that I may continue working for the equality and dignity of the Bolivian people."
"24",976,"BRA",66,2011,"For the very first time in the history of the United Nations  a female voice is opening the general debate. It is the voice of democracy and equality that reverberates from a forum that is committed to being the most representative in the world. It is with a sense of personal humility  but with justifiable pride as a woman  that I greet this historic moment.   I share this emotion with more than half of the human beings on this planet  who  like me  were born women and who  with a sense of purposeful determination  are now taking the place in the world they rightly deserve. I am certain that this will be the century of women. In the Portuguese language  words such as life  soul and hope are feminine nouns. Two other words in Portuguese that are especially dear to me are also feminine  namely  courage and sincerity. And it is in a spirit of courage and sincerity that I wish to address the General Assembly today.   The world is experiencing an extremely delicate period  one that at the same time offers us a major historic opportunity. We face an economic crisis that  if not overcome  could become a source of serious political and social disruption  an unprecedented upheaval capable of causing serious imbalances in relationships between people and nations. More than ever before  the fate of the world is in the hands of its rulers and leaders  with no exceptions. Either we combine our efforts and emerge victorious together  or we will all emerge defeated. It is now less important to know or decide who caused the situation we are facing — because  after all  that is clear enough by now. What does matter is that we start finding collective  speedy and genuine solutions.  The current crisis is too serious to be managed by a few countries. Their Governments and central banks still have the greatest responsibility in implementing the process. Yet  since all countries suffer the consequences  all are entitled to participate in their solutions. It is not because of a lack of financial resources that the leaders of developed countries have not yet found a solution to the crisis. Rather  if I may put it this way  it is due to a lack of political resources and  at times  of clear ideas. There is a part of the world that has not yet found a balance between appropriate fiscal adjustments and correct and precise fiscal stimuli conducive to demand and growth. They have been caught in a trap that does not distinguish between partisan interests and the legitimate interests of society. The challenge posed by the crisis entails replacing outdated theories that belong to an old world with new proposals crafted for a new world.  While many Governments are shrinking  unemployment  the bitterest face of the crisis  is growing. There are already 205 million unemployed people in the world  of whom 44 million are in Europe and 14 million in the United States. Tackling this scourge and preventing it from spreading to other regions of the planet is vitally important. We women know better than anyone that unemployment is not just a statistic; it affects our families  children and   7 11-50692  husbands. It takes away hope and leaves a trail of violence and pain.  It is quite telling that it is the President of an emerging country  a country experiencing almost full employment  who has come here today to speak in such stark terms of a tragedy that has mainly hit developed countries.  Like other emerging countries  Brazil has thus far been less affected by the global crisis. But we know that our ability to withstand the crisis is not unlimited. We are willing and able to help those countries that are already facing an acute crisis  while there is still time. A new kind of cooperation between emerging and developed countries is an historic opportunity to redefine  with solidarity and responsibility  the commitments that govern international relations.  The world of today faces a crisis that is at once of economics  governance and political coordination. There will not be a return to confidence and growth until we intensity coordination efforts among United Nations Member States and other multilateral institutions  including the Group of Twenty  the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  and other organs.   The United Nations and those organizations must act urgently to send clear signals of political cohesion and macroeconomic coordination. For example  fiscal and monetary policies should be submitted to mutual assessment in such a way as to ultimately prevent undesirable effects on other countries  thus avoiding defensive reactions that in turn lead to a vicious circle.   The solution to the debt problem should be combined with economic growth. There are obvious signs that several advanced economies are on the threshold of recession  which will significantly hamper resolution of their fiscal problems.  It is clear that the priority for the world economy at this moment should be to solve the problems of those countries that are facing a sovereign debt crisis and reversing the current recession scenario. The most developed countries must establish coordinated policies to stimulate economies that have been extremely weakened by the crisis. Countries with emerging economies can help in that effort. Countries with a high surplus should strengthen their domestic markets and  as appropriate  make their foreign exchange rate policies more flexible in such a way that contributes to the eventual rebalancing of global demand.   Deepening the regulation of the financial system and controlling that inexhaustible source of instability is a pressing need. Controls must be imposed on the foreign-exchange war by adopting floating foreign-exchange regimes. The task at hand is about preventing the manipulation of foreign exchange that occurs not only through excessively expansionist monetary policies but also through an artificially fixed foreign exchange.   Without a doubt  the reform of multilateral financial institutions should continue  thus increasing the participation of emerging countries  which  as driving forces  are responsible for the growth of the world’s economy. We should fight protectionism and all forms of commercial manipulation. They do increase competitiveness  but in a spurious  fraudulent fashion.  Brazil is doing its homework. With sacrifices  but at the same time with a sense of insightfulness  we have kept Government spending under strict control  to the point of generating a sizable surplus in Government accounts while ensuring that those steps will not compromise the success of our social policies or the pace of our investment and growth. We are also taking additional precautions to buttress our ability to withstand the crisis by strengthening our domestic market with income distribution and technological innovation policies.  For at least three years now  Brazil has reiterated — time and again  from this very podium — that we must all tackle the causes  and not only the consequences  of global instability. We have emphasized time and again the interrelations among development  peace and security. We have often underscored that development policies should be increasingly coupled with the Security Council’s strategies in the pursuit of sustainable peace.   That is how we have acted as part of our commitments to Haiti and to Guinea-Bissau. As a leading country in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  Brazil has since 2004 undertaken humanitarian projects that integrate security and development. With deep respect for Haitian sovereignty  Brazil is proud to assist in the consolidation of democracy in that country.    11-50692 8   We are in a position to provide a solidarity-based contribution to brotherly countries in the developing world in matters such as food security  agricultural technology  generation of clean and renewable energy and the fight against hunger and poverty.  Since late 2010  we have witnessed a series of grass-roots demonstrations that have come to be known as the Arab Spring. Brazil is the adopted homeland of many immigrants from that part of the world. Brazilians sympathize with the pursuit of an ideal that belongs to no culture in particular  because it is by definition universal: freedom.  The nations united here today must find a legitimate and effective way to aid those societies that cry out for reform — without  however  depriving their citizens of a lead role in the process. We strongly repudiate the brutal crack down episodes that victimize civilian populations. We remain convinced that for the international community  resort to force must always be the last alternative.   The quest for peace and security in the world cannot be limited to interventions in extreme situations only. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to engage the United Nations in conflict prevention by tirelessly exercising diplomacy and promoting development. The world of today suffers from the painful consequences of interventions that have worsened existing conflicts. That has allowed terrorism to creep into areas where it previously did not exist  thus generating new cycles of violence and multiplying the number of civilian victims.  Much is said about the responsibility to protect  yet little is said about responsibility while protecting. These are concepts that we must develop and mature together. To that end  the role of the Security Council is critical  and the more legitimate its decisions are  the more appropriate that role will be. And the Council’s very legitimacy increasingly depends upon its reform.   With each passing year  a solution to the lack of representativeness in the Security Council becomes an ever more urgent need  which in turn erodes its efficacy. Former Assembly President Joseph Deiss reminded me of an impressive fact  namely  that the debate on the proposed reform of the Security Council is now entering its eighteenth year.   We can delay no longer. The world needs a Security Council that reflects contemporary realities  a Council that will incorporate new permanent and non-permanent members  especially those representing developing countries.  Brazil is ready to take on its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Council. We have lived in peace with our neighbours for more than 140 years and have fostered successful integration and cooperation processes with them. Our Constitution expressly states our commitment to abstain from the use of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. I am proud to say that Brazil is a driver of peace  stability and prosperity in the region and even beyond it.  In the Human Rights Council  we have drawn inspiration from our own history of endeavour as a nation. We desire for other countries what we desire for ourselves. Authoritarianism  xenophobia  poverty  capital punishment and discrimination are all sources of human rights violations. We know that violations occur in every country  without exception. We must recognize this reality  and we must accept criticism. We will ultimately benefit from criticism  and we should pointedly criticize flagrant violations wherever they occur.  I welcome South Sudan to our family of nations. Brazil is ready to cooperate with the youngest Member of the United Nations and to contribute to its sovereign development.   I regret  however  that from this podium I am still unable to welcome Palestine into full membership of the Organization. Brazil has recognized the Palestinian State as defined by the 1967 borders  in accordance with United Nations resolutions. Like most countries in the Assembly  we believe that the time has come for Palestine to be represented as a full Member in this forum.  The recognition of the Palestinian people’s legitimate right to sovereignty and self-rule expands the possibilities and prospects for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Only a free and sovereign Palestine can respond to Israel’s legitimate desire for peace with its neighbours  security within its borders and political stability in its region. I come from a country where descendents of Arabs and Jews are compatriots and live together in harmony  which is as it should be.  Brazil advocates for a global  comprehensive and ambitious agreement within the framework of the United Nations to fight climate change. To achieve   9 11-50692  this  countries must shoulder their respective responsibilities. Brazil submitted a concrete  voluntary and significant proposal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. We hope to be able to make progress at the upcoming meeting in Durban by supporting developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions  and at the same time ensuring that developed countries fulfil their obligations  beyond 2012  on the basis of new targets under the Kyoto Protocol.   Brazil will have the honour of hosting the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development — Rio+20 — in June of 2012. Along with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  I reiterate our invitation to all heads of State and Government to join us at that Conference next year.  Brazil has learned that fighting poverty is the best development policy  and that a genuine human rights policy must ultimately be based on reducing inequalities and discrimination between and among regions  people and genders. Brazil has made political  economic and social progress without compromising any of its democratic freedoms. We have met almost all of the Millennium Development Goals before 2015. Forty million Brazilian men and women have come up out of poverty and been lifted into the middle class. I am fully confident that we will achieve our goal of eradicating extreme poverty in Brazil by the end of my term in office.  In my country  women have been vital to the task of overcoming social inequalities. Our income distribution programmes place mothers as the central figures in the scheme. It is they who manage the resources that allow families to invest in the health and education of their children. Yet my country  like every other nation  still has to do much more when it comes to valuing women and asserting their status. In that regard  I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General for making women a priority during his tenure at the head of the United Nations. I particularly welcome the creation of UN-Women and the appointment of its Executive Director  Ms. Michelle Bachelet.  Besides speaking on behalf of my own beloved country  I feel that when I stand up here I am representing all the women of the world — the anonymous women  those who starve and cannot feed their children  those who are suffering from illnesses and cannot get treatment  those who are victims of violence or who are discriminated against at work  in society and in their family life  and those who labour at home to bring up future generations. I add my voice to those of the women who have dared to struggle  to take part in political and professional life  and who have thus gained the spheres of power that allow me to stand here today.  As a woman who was the victim of torture while in prison  I am all too aware of how important values such as democracy  justice  human rights and freedom are to all of us. It is my hope that these values will continue to inspire the work of this house of nations  where I am honoured to open the general debate of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly."
"25",1020,"BRB",66,2011,"I am pleased to convey my greetings to the President and to offer him the congratulations of my Government and the delegation of Barbados on his election as President of the General Assembly at this sixty-sixth session. Those of us who are familiar with the very high standards to which he routinely subscribes confidently expect him to steer the deliberations of this session with his accustomed calm and skill. It is appropriate that I also commend his predecessor in office  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the aplomb with which he guided the deliberations of the sixty-fifth session of this Assembly.  I am also pleased to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. I acknowledge the sterling work that he has done over the past five years  and wish him a successful second term.   I am especially delighted to extend congratulations to the Government and people of the    11-51360 44  Republic of South Sudan on their achievement of independence. On behalf of the Government and people of Barbados  I reiterate our support and solidarity on South Sudan’s admission to the United Nations as its 193rd Member.  It is with genuine pleasure that I address the Assembly today in my capacity as Prime Minister of Barbados. The untimely death 11 months ago of my predecessor in office placed on my shoulders the primary responsibility of pursuing the ideals to which Barbados is committed both at home and abroad.  Some 45 years ago  our first Prime Minister  in his maiden address to this Assembly  articulated our position in the following terms:   “The people of Barbados do not draw a dividing line between their internal affairs and their foreign policy. They strive in their domestic arrangements to create a just society for themselves. In their Constitution they affirm respect for the rule of law; they also declare their intention to establish and maintain the kind of society which enables each citizen  to the full extent of his capacity  to play his part in national life … In thus charting our domestic course  we can have no interest in a foreign policy that contradicts our national goals … [W]e are exponents  not of the diplomacy of power  but of the diplomacy of peace and prosperity.” (A/PV.1487  paras. 75-78)  Much  of course  has changed since then. The world we know today is vastly different from the world of 1966  yet we continue to keep faith with the vision of the father of our independence. My task in addressing the General Assembly on matters of foreign policy is therefore  paradoxically  at once easy and difficult. It is easy because we still adhere to our foundational principles; it is difficult because we now have to apply them in a world that has grown much more complex  much more volatile and much more dangerous.  If we need further proof that we live in an interconnected world  the present economic downturn provides a painful reminder. When large economies such as those of the United States and Europe are reeling  one may well imagine the toll that the worst crisis since the Great Depression is taking on small vulnerable societies like those that populate the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.  We in Barbados have chosen to withstand the economic storms that assail us by relying on the good judgment of our people to come together in times of peril. My Government has partnered with the business community and the trade union movement to ensure that layoffs and wage demands alike are kept to an absolute minimum so that the gain and the pain are shared equitably. We are committed to protecting the most vulnerable among us because it is our settled conviction that a nation is more than just an economy; it is also a society.  The cruel irony of the current downturn is that it might have been avoided if corporations had restrained their greed and Government oversight and regulation at the international  regional and national levels had been more vigorous and rigorous. This highlights the urgent need for a new architecture of global finance that will render unlikely the prospect of our lurching from one crisis to another  and lay the groundwork for a smooth and balanced economic recovery that avoids the massive social dislocations we are now witnessing. Recovery that comes at the expense of the poorest and most vulnerable in our societies is not only unenlightened economics  but also very dangerous politics.  We in Barbados have welcomed the rise of the global economy in the past two decades  since it has the potential for creating prosperity for all nations. But it will realize its potential only if the increasingly volatile flows of international capital are governed by fair and transparent rules. In laying down an orderly framework for global financial and economic transactions  we urge that the international community apply the principle enunciated by Aristotle upwards of 2 000 years ago that there should be equality between equals and proportionality between unequals.  Barbados believes that the path to prosperity lies in open economies  open societies and open Governments  and is constantly positioning itself to compete as a fully compliant  transparent  rules-governed global entrepreneurial and financial centre.  Yet  to our dismay  we find that the rich and powerful keep changing the rules to their advantage and to our disadvantage. It is a violation both of fair play and of common sense to move the goalposts while the game is in progress. Let it be clearly understood that  on this issue  it is not charity we seek; it is justice we demand.   45 11-51360   However  none of the nations represented in this Assembly will enjoy sustainable prosperity if we continue to abuse the environment which we hold in sacred trust for future generations. It is an inconvenient truth that the success of humankind’s development goals will depend on the ability of our planet to sustain our consumption and production activities. We must be cautious  therefore  about how we use fossil fuels  about carbon emission levels and about the unregulated treatment of waste. The planet has now begun to protest through dramatic changes in climate and the prospect of sea-level rise. The very existence of small island States like those in the Caribbean and the Pacific could be imperilled if current trends are not halted or reversed.  Barbados has been an active participant in the environmental movement since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio. We are proud to have hosted the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States in 1994 and continue to work with other small island developing States to update and improve the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for its further implementation. We continue to work also towards the success of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.  I am deeply honoured to have been asked to serve on the Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability. That our task is challenging no one will deny  required as we are to formulate a blueprint for economic growth and prosperity that focuses on the eradication of poverty  while ensuring greater equality and inclusion and reducing the devastating impact of human activities on ecosystems and the environment. The work of the Panel is progressing smoothly  and I assure the Assembly that my colleagues and I have readily accepted the challenge.  Without peace and security  it is difficult to create and maintain the social conditions that constitute a prerequisite for economic progress and prosperity. The protracted conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians has become a disturbing anomaly in a world where so many other disputes have been peacefully resolved. It is an anomaly because everyone knows what the solution is. It is disturbing because the only thing preventing a resolution of the issue is an unhappy convergence of dysfunctional political currents at the domestic level.  The State of Israel has a right to exist  and the people of Israel have a right to live in security and to do so with the full and undisputed recognition of the rest of the world. On the other hand  the Palestinians are entitled also to enjoy the fruits of prosperity within their own sovereign State. Much else in this conflict may be negotiable. Surely  those two postulates are not. The Holy Land has for centuries been the locus of humanity’s hopes. It is high time that it now become a symbol  not of humanity’s divisions  but of humanity’s unity. This state of affairs will ensue only when the disgracefully long wait of the Palestinians for a homeland is brought to an end.  In a similar vein  the Government and the people of Barbados fully embrace Cuba as an important partner in the Caribbean region and  since 1972  have committed themselves to a policy of constructive engagement with its Government and people. Barbados respects the sovereign rights of Cuba and supports unequivocally its full integration into our hemisphere. Barbados does not believe that actions such as the decades-long economic embargo aimed at isolating Cuba  or any other measures that create greater hardship for the Cuban people  will facilitate the full integration which we consider to be both desirable and necessary. My delegation thinks  therefore  that the economic embargo against Cuba has long outlived its usefulness and should be lifted.  Barbados remains committed also to supporting the development and the advancement of the people of Haiti. For my delegation  the reconstruction of Haiti  including the rebuilding of its democratic institutions  continues to be a high priority. We fully support the call made in July by the Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community for the international community to fulfil its pledges to finance the reconstruction of Haiti following the devastation of the earthquake that occurred in January 2010.  Terrorism  whether emanating from States or from non-State actors  is an attack on what we have always known to be the core values of the Organization. I speak of the rule of law; the protection of civilians; mutual respect between people of different faiths and cultures; and the peaceful resolution of conflict.  It is the view of my delegation that the United Nations must be the foremost form of collective security against terrorism  convinced as we are that    11-51360 46  while terrorism may arise out of conditions of insecurity and deprivation  it should never be accepted or justified in the pursuit of any cause whatsoever.  Barbados therefore continues to be an active and committed partner in global efforts to combat terrorism and other transnational criminal activities. We have experienced first-hand the deleterious effects on our societies of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. At their Summit in July 2011  CARICOM Heads of Government committed themselves to accord the highest national and regional priority to combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition.  We have a vested interest  therefore  in the success of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty  to be held in 2012. We will continue to work with other Member States to achieve the ultimate objective of a legally binding  robust and comprehensive Arms Trade Treaty which imposes the highest possible standards for the transfer of conventional arms  including small arms  light weapons and ammunition.  Much has changed since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. Some of the global challenges we face today  such as the pandemics of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases  climate change  the growth of the illicit drug trade  transnational crime and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  are new. Others  including extreme poverty  genocide  terrorism and civil conflict  are old. Yet the need for the United Nations remains as pressing today as it was at the time of its formation. While the United Nations is an organization of sovereign States  it exists to serve the needs of all the peoples of the world.  We need to be constantly reminded  therefore  that even if he can vote to choose his Government  a young man living with AIDS who faces daily discrimination is not truly free. Even if she earns a comfortable living  a woman who lives in fear of daily violence and has no say in how her country is run is not truly free. Even if he enjoys freedom of speech and assembly  a young man dying of hunger is not truly free. Freedom to live in dignity  freedom from fear and freedom from want are inextricably connected. Indeed  all people  wherever they can be found  have the right to security and to development.  As Member States  we must recommit ourselves  therefore  to realizing the ideals of the Organization  bearing in mind that commitment to the pragmatic and the possible must sometimes be our steppingstone to the realization of the ideal. That approach  Barbados is convinced  is an infallible way of giving effect to the determination of the founders of the United Nations “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”."
"26",1052,"BRN",66,2011,"On behalf of His Majesty and the people of Brunei Darussalam  I would like to congratulate our new President  His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz    11-51384 20  Al-Nasser. These are not only personal congratulations. We also congratulate his country  Qatar  our fellow Member of the United Nations. We greatly appreciate its significant efforts to promote dialogue  consultation and mediation in many difficult situations  both in its own region and far beyond. Thus we thank the President  as its representative  and warmly welcome him to the General Assembly as the representative of us all.   We would also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. His term of office saw another impressive contribution by the United Nations to meeting the great international challenges Members face in the first decade of this new century.   Some of that work began right here  in this building  with our efforts to reform the Security Council and revitalize the General Assembly. Other efforts addressed our world at large and the confrontation between essential economic growth and critical environmental realities that it faces. Still others were aimed directly at the people we represent. Those efforts addressed their health and food security; considered their personal and legal status  whether at home or as members of immigrant communities; and examined the systems of governance under which they live.  This is a fine record  and we thank the outgoing President for his leadership. He was greatly assisted in his work by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We offer the Secretary-General our very best wishes for the coming year. We welcome his reappointment and join fellow Members in thanking his staff and the United Nations volunteer workers  peacekeepers and agencies for all of their efforts in many extremely difficult situations.   It is a tribute to their work that one of the longest-running and most complex situations of all has been resolved this year. As a result  we add our own words of welcome to the Government and the people of South Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. We also commend all parties involved in the process of dialogue  negotiation and final resolution. At the same time  it is our deepest wish that these same sentiments may soon be expressed to the parties directly involved in efforts to reach a fair and equitable two-State solution to the situation in Palestine.  The President of the Assembly has asked us to consider the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. In doing so  we follow the direction given by His Majesty the Sultan in his address to the General Assembly in 1984  when we had the honour of becoming a Member of this great Organization. In outline  it committed us to mutual respect for territorial integrity and the principles of dialogue and negotiation in disputes  no matter how long or how frustrating the process may be.   We still adhere to that principle. We give whatever practical assistance we can  whenever asked. We do so directly  through peacekeeping and monitoring efforts  and indirectly  through financial contributions made bilaterally and to relevant United Nations and regional bodies. In these ways  we seek to follow the commitments made in our first General Assembly debate.   Nevertheless  we increasingly recognize that those commitments were made over a quarter of a century ago. Twenty-five years is a common definition of a generation in human terms  which means that a new generation is now moving into positions of authority. Behind it  a further generation is now coming of age. It has no personal memory of the global situation that shaped international policy in the Cold War era. Although both generations are naturally still influenced by those times and the leaders who brought them to this point  they are also new generations  for whom the new century shapes world affairs.  In our statement to the General Assembly three years ago (see A/63/PV.10)  we outlined our approach to this by broadly setting out what are now regarded as the challenges of this new century. Some involve security in all of its forms — political  physical and economic. Others address the natural environment and the effects of climate change. Still others raise questions about sustainable development and many challenges arise from the concept of good governance  both nationally and in world organizations such as the World Trade Organization  the International Monetary Fund  the Group of Twenty and even the United Nations itself. We have given our full support to the great institutions of which we are members and will continue to do so.  But our Government has emphasized one thing throughout this year in all international gatherings we have been privileged to attend. It is not a change in our   21 11-51384  overall approach; it represents a particular focus. It means that more and more we are trying to identify the challenges in basic human terms  because we feel that such a focus relates directly to the wise theme the President proposed for this debate.   We acknowledge with deep respect that successful mediation has always been a cherished objective of the United Nations  and we strongly support that ideal. At the same time  however  we maintain that no mediation can be successful unless the parties involved share common ground.  What concerns us is that the dynamics of the twenty-first century have the potential to exclude many from this common ground. It will become the exclusive territory of great unseen globalized forces  whether in the market  the workplace or in the world of great decision-making forums. That development could be so divisive as to destroy any common ground.   We believe such common ground will only be created by ordinary people  as individuals and in their families and communities  who feel that they are indeed occupying that common ground. For them  political security lies in the principles of diplomacy among all nations  especially respect for each other’s traditions  values  beliefs and ways of life. Physical security means the rule of law. Economic security is food on the table  a job and the best possible support for health  education and old age.   In all these efforts  we have felt well guided by the United Nations  above all through the encouragement it provides towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the confidence in the future that they give to all people. That  we believe  will lead us towards the common ground we are trying to discover. It will be reached when it is shared among the most powerful of industrialized nations and the smallest of threatened island communities. The search for common ground is the immense task of both present and future generations. We believe that only when it is concluded can mediation successfully perform the role suggested in the President’s theme."
"27",1093,"BTN",66,2011,"My country is most happy to welcome South Sudan as a member of the United Nations family. I now seek the permission of the Members to speak on the subject of happiness.  Since joining the United Nations 41 years ago  Bhutan has always maintained a long-term and broad perspective on the purpose of this great Organization  which is to create a secure and harmonious society. But in the many times that I have participated in the United Nations General Assembly over the last 25 years  I cannot recall a session that gave me reason for hope for the future of humanity  except once. That was when the cold war came to a thundering halt  and a euphoric world saw it as the dawn of a new era. I was then a young ambassador excited by the prospects of peace dividends. Instead  what followed was a sense of betrayal and disillusionment  as the world became ever more divided and insecure.  We gather before this high podium  year after year  and make of this annual gathering a mournful event. We speak of what ought to be  of promises broken and opportunities lost. We speak of endless conflicts within and among nations  of the failures of Governments  of frequent and devastating disasters  of diminishing resources and fierce competition for their control  of dying ecosystems and new threatening diseases and epidemics  and of financial calamities and economic ruin. We speak of rising unemployment  hopeless poverty  hunger and destitution. And of course  we talk of solutions.  Lacking the political will and  indeed  clarity of vision  we deny with clever arguments what we know to be the cause of our predicaments. So we go on doing   35 11-51185  what is irrational. We continue to acquire arms to prevent war; answer climate change with more harmful emissions; race to extract  produce and consume more in the face of depleting resources; fuel faltering economies with debt and greed; and enable the wealthy to widen the deep crevasses that separate the rich from the poor. We idealize individualism as family and community crumble amid rising social dislocation  crime  mental illness  loneliness and suicide.  For too long  we have ignored the truth that the causes of all those problems are interrelated and that durable remedies must be found through a rational and holistic approach. For too long  we have refused to accept that economic models focused on gross domestic product have served their useful purpose and that we need to switch tracks. Guided by the misbelief that life satisfaction is about material pursuit and accumulation and that good economics is about limitless growth  our economic development processes have created the monster of a consumerist market economy.  However  the market gives no satisfaction. It enslaves humanity and thrives on the insatiable nature of our greed. As slaves  our value as individuals and nations is measured by the extent of our economic productivity and consumption capacity. That sad transformation  from humans into voracious beasts  comes at the cost of our physical  psychological and spiritual well-being. It is destroying our natural life-support systems and threatening our long-term survival. But that need not be so.  Humankind is in need of a clear vision that transcends the diversity of our cultures  thoughts and circumstances and binds us to a common pursuit. We need a different development paradigm that is guided by a vision that is holistic  sustainable  inclusive and humane. Such a vision can take civilization forward and enable it to sustain the progress that it has created and must continue to make.  It is therefore with a great sense of joy that my country welcomed resolution 65/309  entitled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development”. Introduced by Bhutan and sponsored by 68 Member States  it was adopted unanimously without a vote in July. Through that resolution  Member States adopted a universal goal  while acknowledging the limitations of our conventional development processes. It commits our nations to creating the necessary political  social and economic conditions to enable the pursuit of happiness by citizens within a stable environment.  My delegation is of the firm conviction that happiness or well-being  as it is promoted in my country  would be against a well-developed set of indices  a natural progression from the Millennium Development Goals  which aim to establish the minimum conditions for human survival and the basis for development. It is  indeed  a universal value that binds the rich and the poor  and the developed and the developing  and articulates the ultimate purpose of life. It is about making true societal progress in ways that are meaningful  joyful and lasting.  In that regard  I am happy to report that my Government  in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme  the Earth Institute of Columbia University and leading scientists and thinkers on the science and economics of happiness  are working in concert to prepare the panel discussion stipulated by the resolution. Proposed to be held in New York in the spring of 2012 before the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  the meeting will endeavour to present to Member States a set of policy recommendations in their pursuit of happiness as they work in harmonious collaboration with each other with a shared and clear sense of purpose. We look forward to Members’ participation in that meeting.  My delegation remains fully committed to the promotion of a sustainable and progressive human civilization within a peaceful and secure environment. To that happy end  Bhutan is prepared to share its experience and the modest development achievements made with the support of our generous partners. Our attempts to promote equitable and sustainable social economic growth are bearing fruit within a rich biodiversity that includes a forest cover that has expanded from 64 per cent to 81 per cent in four decades. Today  Bhutan is the only country that has pledged to remain carbon neutral forever. Our social and cultural values remain vital  even as we embrace globalization and its many offerings. We have successfully and smoothly transited from an absolute monarchy to a fully fledged and vibrant democracy.  For those reasons and out of a sense of duty and obligation  my country aspires to serve as a non-permanent member on the Security Council for the biennium    11-51185 36  2013-2014. Having been a member of the United Nations for 41 years and never having served on the Council  while having fully enjoyed the benefits of membership  we wish to contribute as a small State for small States. We believe that we can bring to the Security Council a fresh and holistic perspective on peace and security beyond its narrow confines and open it to new and innovative approaches to fulfilling its important mandate. My country is of the firm belief that maintaining peace and security is not only about preventing war. It is about recognizing and forging the will to deal with all forms of threat to the survival  progress and happiness of human society.  Yes  I speak of a dream  but it is possible. As leaders and representatives of our peoples  we must dare to dream and find the courage and determination to pursue the highest of ideals. That is how happiness is to be fashioned. Blessings and good luck!  My country prays for Members’ support to give Bhutan an opportunity to contribute to the realization of shared dreams. I wish participants happiness."
"28",1134,"BWA",66,2011,"It is with infinite pleasure  Mr. President  that I join other speakers who preceded me in expressing our felicitations to you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We owe an immense debt of gratitude to your great country  the State of Qatar  for making you available to the service of the international community. We are confident that under your guidance and leadership the sixty-sixth session will achieve a successful outcome  one which will make a difference to the lives of multitudes of disadvantaged people around the world. May I also pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  whose effective and exemplary stewardship of the sixty-fifth session earned our deep respect and admiration.  As the world’s problems have in recent decades increased in numbers and complexity  so have the challenges and responsibilities of the United Nations Secretary-General  the head of our grand institution. I am pleased to note that the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  has acquitted himself extremely well  at times under very difficult circumstances. We specifically wish to commend him for his concerted efforts in raising the alarm on conflict situations and emerging threats to international peace and security. Allow me therefore to seize this opportunity to sincerely congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his well-deserved reappointment for a second term.  My delegation is of the conviction that all problems and challenges confronting humanity can be resolved within the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter and international law. In that connection  we must each do our part and work together to improve the lives of our people by conquering hunger  disease and illiteracy  to encourage respect for human rights and freedoms and to respond to natural disasters and different humanitarian situations.  Once again this year  the world has experienced a number of natural and man-made disasters  including violent  senseless attacks that have claimed numerous lives  left many homeless  caused massive destruction of property and caused intolerable pain and suffering.    11-51384 2  My delegation wishes to express our heartfelt condolences to all those countries that have been victims of those tragedies.  Our profound sympathies and heartfelt condolences go to the Government and people of Japan for the unfortunate Fukushima incident  triggered by a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck that country early this year. We also wish to convey our condolences and sympathies to the Government and people of Norway on the recent senseless and horrifying attack that left many people dead.  The humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa equally deserves our attention. We commend the United Nations for calling the attention of the international community to the plight of the victims of that disaster. We in Botswana have made our modest contribution to that relief effort. We express our sincere appreciation to the United Nations system and the international community as a whole for their generous and timely response to those tragedies.  At the inception of the United Nations  the international community pledged a solemn determination to safeguard succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In the intervening period  the world has seen monumental changes with profound effects on humanity. The end of colonialism and the cold war  the defeat of the inhuman system of apartheid  the institutionalization of conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms around the world  as well as the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and regional organizations in dealing with conflict situations  come to mind in this regard.  For decades the people of South Sudan have been engulfed in a seemingly endless bloody conflagration  accompanied by heavy loss of human life  destruction of property and condemnation to untold misery and suffering. However  we are delighted that the people of South Sudan  with the assistance and support of the international community  have realized their long-cherished dream. They now face a new dawn of freedom and nationhood. Allow me  therefore  to pay a fitting tribute to South Sudan on the assumption of her rightful place in the comity of nations as a sovereign and independent State and the 193rd Member of the United Nations.  South Sudan will obviously need the full support of the international community in addressing the plethora of challenges of nationhood  including outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement such as the future of the Abyei region  and other separation issues that could easily undermine this fragile transition. Botswana will endeavour  within the limit of her resources  to assist our brothers and sisters in South Sudan translate their political freedom into tangible social and economic benefits.  The evolving situation in Côte d’Ivoire is also a cause for optimism. While many security concerns remain  we believe President Ouattara and his Government have put in place the necessary measures to consolidate peace  build confidence  promote national reconciliation and set the country on the path to normalcy  reconstruction and sustainable development. We urge the international community to remain actively engaged in supporting this process.  While notable strides have been made towards resolving some conflicts  regrettably the same cannot be said of many other conflict situations  such as those in the Middle East  Somalia and Syria  where peace remains elusive  with attendant hardship and misery.  On Somalia  my delegation takes note of the conclusion of the recent Kampala Accord between the President of the Federal Transitional Government and the Speaker of Parliament  which is a welcome move towards improving the political situation in that country. However  we remain concerned about the deteriorating security situation and the growing humanitarian crisis in that country  and we call on all parties to remain engaged and to fully honour their obligations under that Accord.  Regarding the Middle East  Botswana shares the general frustration at the prolonged impasse in the situation in that region. We call on both the Palestinians and Israelis to remain engaged in the negotiations on the basis of a two-State solution  in which the two peoples will live side by side in peace and harmony.  There are other emerging threats to international peace and security. My delegation is deeply concerned about States that continue to violate with impunity their obligations under their constitutions and international law to protect their citizens from any armed conflict.   This very Organization is founded on the premise that Governments have the primary duty and responsibility to do all in their power to safeguard the   3 11-51384  legitimate aspirations of their people for a better life  including ensuring their safety and security. It is therefore imperative that Governments provide an environment conducive to addressing the legitimate concerns and grievances of their people through inclusive dialogue and mutual understanding.  Consequently  it is not acceptable under any circumstances for any State to use military force against the civilian population — the very citizens it has sworn to protect. I believe we all agree that this is a clear violation of human rights and international law and an infringement of our common value system enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  Our view is that any leader who sanctions such use of force on his people forfeits the legitimate right to be recognized as representing the interests of his people. The international community should therefore spare no effort in applying all the necessary measures at its disposal to protect civilians from such repressive Governments and to hold them accountable for their atrocities. In this regard  support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) is crucial for realizing the full implementation of the Rome Statute.  We commend the Security Council for its swift and resolute action on Libya under its resolution 1973 (2011)  which authorized NATO to protect civilians in that country.   However  we remain concerned about the delay and procrastination on a number of situations in Syria. The Council’s condemnation of human rights violations and the military assault on civilians by Syria came rather too late. It failed to convey a clear and unequivocal message of revulsion to the Syrian authorities and to urge them to respect international humanitarian law and human rights. Crimes against humanity have been committed in Syria  and the leadership in that country should answer for such crimes through the ICC.  It is important that the international community remain vigilant against any breach of international peace and security and also respond in a decisive  consistent and timely manner to any such instances. We find it unacceptable that such countries as mentioned can continue to belong to a community of peace-loving nations.  Botswana recognizes the National Transitional Council (NTC) in Libya as the interim Administration until there is an elected Government. We therefore welcome the NTC into the United Nations family to represent the Libyan people during this session.  The chosen theme for this session — the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes — is both timely and pertinent. It is timely  given the multiplicity of mediation efforts in which the international community is currently engaged as part of an effort to find a peaceful solution to the conflicts raging in various parts of the world. It is pertinent in that forging international peace and understanding is the raison d’être of this very body.  In order to maintain momentum in governance  my delegation believes that countries emerging from conflict should also commit themselves to the strict observance of human rights and national and international humanitarian law  as well as of the values of accountability and transparency  guided by effective application of the rule of law. In this respect  I wish to reiterate my country’s support for all efforts geared towards assisting countries emerging from conflict to make successful transitions to post-conflict rehabilitation  reconstruction and economic recovery.  Allow me now to turn to another critical pillar of the United Nations mandate  namely  sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. Now more than ever  our global citizenry is demanding practical actions to address the global challenges we face. They believe — and rightly so — that collectively we are equipped with enough resources  institutions  policies and lessons learned to respond effectively to existing and emerging global challenges. They therefore expect us to muster the requisite political will to find durable solutions to those challenges.   For them  it is no longer acceptable for children to die from HIV and AIDS or any other preventable disease just because the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights hinders access to affordable treatment. They do not accept that over 113 million children have no access to primary education. It is certainly no longer acceptable for people to die from cholera and other waterborne diseases when affordable technology for clean water and sanitation exists. Nor is it acceptable for our people to continue to be exposed to the dire consequences of climate change  while we debate endlessly instead of concluding a comprehensive     11-51384 4  legally binding climate change regime to curb global warming and its effects.   In other words  our people want us to do more with the collective resources that we have at our disposal.  The residual effects of the financial and economic crisis  coupled with ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the prevailing high cost of energy and food  have compounded the setbacks experienced in the implementation of internationally agreed goals and commitments  including the Millennium Development Goals. We must ensure that sustainable development in all its three pillars — social  economic and environmental — remains the key framework for attaining a balanced approach towards development in our countries. In that context  poverty eradication should remain the centrepiece of all our policies and programmes.   As we prepare for a common global policy on sustainable development in Brazil in June of next year  we are increasingly concerned about the negative trend the negotiations are taking. The ongoing climate change negotiations  the failed nineteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the ongoing discussions on the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development continue to expose deep divisions among our countries. Unfortunately  those divisions undermine the implementation of existing commitments and threaten prospects for an effective global sustainable development regime. We believe that the Rio+20 processes present an excellent platform for all Member States  individually and collectively  to muster their resolve towards the attainment of sustainable development.  Similarly  the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in South Africa later this year  offers the international community yet another valuable opportunity to reverse the harmful effects of climate change on our planet. We must forge a spirit of cooperation and partnership  including through South-South cooperation  public-private partnerships  resource mobilization and technology transfer  as well as capacity-building  to assist countries such as my own to exploit the abundant coal reserves for sustainable energy production in a manner less harmful to the environment.  Significant progress was made in that respect last September  when we resolved to take effective measures to further strengthen support for and meet the special needs of regions and countries struggling to achieve economic and social development  including middle-income countries. Recent experience has shown that even that category of countries  which have made small gains in poverty reduction  are still vulnerable in the event of further global economic and financial upheaval.  The limitations imposed by our fragile economy and the landlocked position of my country  Botswana  also call for the speedy implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action  accompanied by renewed efforts to level the playing field in international trade. We must muster the political will to conclude the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization trade negotiations as soon as possible.  We as nations  individually and collectively  face the greatest challenge of our time — the uplifting of humankind. In fulfilling that mammoth task  our greatest hope lies in our ability as leaders to summon our courage and political will to do what is right.  Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s commitment to working with other Members in our common endeavour to put our Organization at the service of humanity."
"29",1177,"CAF",66,2011,"At the outset  I would like to convey to the President  on behalf of His Excellency Army General François Bozizé  Head of State and President of the Central African Republic  who it is my honour to represent here  our heartfelt congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. He can rest assured of our full readiness to cooperate with him to ensure the success of his challenging task. I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the talent and dedication that he demonstrated as he steered our work throughout the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly. To His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  I convey my heartfelt congratulations on his reappointment to the head of the Organization.   Lastly  the Central African Republic welcomes the admission of South Sudan  a brotherly neighbouring country  as the 193rd Member State of the United Nations.  In proposing “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes through peaceful means” as the central theme of the general debate of the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly  the President has placed our deliberations at the very heart of those problems that are of current concern to the international community. It must be recalled that the maintenance of international peace and security around the world continues to be the primary mission of the Organization  and that  for Member States  mediation continues to be an indispensable tool in the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The Central African Republic remains committed to the principles of the United Nations Charter  which enshrines language pertaining to the peaceful settlement of conflicts — principally through mediation and prevention.  The international community faces many challenges to which we need to provide tailored responses in order to together build a better world.   We attach particular attention to the issue of climate change and the environment. Protecting the environment and combating climate change are major challenges  as well a priority for the international community  given the many and varied risks that they pose to ecosystems and economies.   The commemoration  next year  of the twentieth anniversary of the first Earth Summit on sustainable development will be devoted to forests. Tropical forests  including those in the Central African Republic  are exposed to various harmful and destructive activities associated with the pressure exerted by social problems and natural disasters. The countries concerned have recognized the need to formulate land-use policies in order to conserve their biodiversity  both in terms of flora and fauna  in these regions.   Furthermore  the drought that is currently afflicting the Horn of Africa  where approximately    11-51398 16  12 million human lives are threatened  is a source of major concern and requires broad-scale mobilization by the international community.   That brings me to the issue of food security. The Central African Republic will support a draft resolution on food development  some provisions of which would be incorporated in the various resolutions of the Assembly and in other United Nations meetings throughout the year.  Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament remain a priority. The Central African Republic welcomes the renewed interest in disarmament on the part of the international community. Greatly concerned by the nuclear threat to all of humankind  non-nuclear-weapon States are entitled to call upon those who possess nuclear weapons to fully shoulder their responsibilities by implementing specific measures to bring about genuine nuclear disarmament. For its part  the Central African Republic will spare no effort to support any United Nations initiative to that end.  Today  terrorism remains a scourge of the international community. In resolution 1963 (2010)  the Security Council declared its intent to hold a special meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) on 28 September 2011  open to all United Nations Member States  to mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of its resolution 1373 (2001) establishing the CTC. It should be recalled that the CTC has done a great deal in assisting Member States in undertaking actions to combat this scourge by strengthening the implementation of standards and border controls  as well as in the fight against the financing of terrorism.  The Central African Republic remains committed to the universal values of human rights  democracy and good governance. We reaffirm our commitment to working throughout this sixty-sixth session with the other Members of the United Nations to provide responses that uphold those values.   The fight against impunity and against violations of human rights is a given for our community. We hope to see it placed within an overall approach that does not hinder the process of political crisis and conflict resolution around the world or undermine regional and international efforts provided for by the United Nations Charter.  The Central African Republic attaches special importance to the reform of this Organization and all its bodies with regard to their structures  modes of operation and work methods. For this reason  we remain committed to the African position regarding the Security Council. Indeed  in all the ongoing crises in the world  the Security Council has gradually imposed the authority of the United Nations  placing it at the service of international peace and security. Its action is and remains legitimate. Its authority will be further strengthened when we reach an agreement on its expansion  which will enable us to take the emergence of new Powers into account by giving a more equitable place to all continents.  Like many African States  my country has been engaged on the path towards democratic governance since the 1990s. As part of our democratic process  we have endeavoured to improve the management of public policy on the political  economic and social fronts. We are aware that much remains to be done in these spheres.   The renewed trust of the Central African in His Excellency General of the Army François Bozizé Yangouvonda  President of the Republic and Head of State  has given him the opportunity to pursue the successful task he began on 15 March 2003. We are determined to break with instability and at long last to turn the page on political-military upheavals. That will enable him to focus on reconstruction. In other words  we will do everything to consolidate that peace that guarantees enduring development. Without peace and security  there can be no economic development that benefits the population as a whole.   It is from this standpoint that the Central African Government held a round table in Brussels with our development partners on 16 and 17 June in order to raise the awareness of the international community with respect to the funding needs of the programmes outlined in the second poverty reduction strategy paper.  The matter of security remains at the very heart of our concerns. Part of the population of the Central African Republic continues to suffer the aggression of rebels belonging to the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony. The activity of the LRA  a cruel and barbaric rebellion from a country that shares no borders with the Central African Republic  remains the source of atrocities  destruction  looting  rape  forced recruitment and the deportation of men  women and children. Mobilization on all sides and the shared   17 11-51398  allocation of resources are needed to eradicate that scourge once and for all.  The Government of the Central African Republic greatly appreciates the initiatives of the United Nations  the African Union and the United States on this issue. We continue to believe that the Republic of South Sudan will join other affected countries in this relentless struggle against a cross-border enemy that harbours vague ambitions harmful to the stability required for development of our subregion.  The December 2010 withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad left a security vacuum that my country is trying to fill despite our limited resources. The same holds true for Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic deployed by the Economic Community of Central African States  whose mandate expires at the end of December 2013.  Reinforcing the capacities of our defence and security forces  which are slated to take over from the international forces  is still far from complete. I should like here to thank the United Nations through its Peacebuilding Fund  which has been supporting the Central African Republic in its tireless quest for peace and stability.  In the light of all this  I appeal once again to the international community to take urgent action in order to build peace and prevent conflict in the Central African Republic. We welcome in advance all commitments that have been or will be made on our behalf. We are convinced that the dividends of those efforts will benefit both the Central African Republic  which lies at the heart of the African continent  and the entire subregion."
"30",1224,"CAN",66,2011,"Nearly 66 years ago  in 1946  one of my predecessors was privileged to represent Canada at the first session of the General Assembly. It is an honour to follow in those footsteps and to renew Canada’s commitment to the founding principles of the United Nations  namely  to maintain international peace and security; to prevent and remove threats to peace; to suppress acts of aggression; to respect the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples; to strengthen universal peace; and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. This Hall symbolizes the promise of humankind and what we can accomplish by working together to uphold those founding principles.  Yet  only a short distance from here is an entirely different symbol - ground zero. The date 9/11 was a stark reminder that evil exists  that life is fragile  that freedom has enemies  and that the poison of radical terrorism is all too real. It serves as a reminder that  as far as humankind has advanced  threats to peace  security and human dignity remain.  In that context  I wish to share reflections on three areas: first  the principles that motivate Canada’s approach to foreign policy; secondly  the basis for Canada’s support of multilateral organizations and multilateral action; and thirdly  a way forward for the United Nations.  The founding principles of these United Nations are more than mere words. It is our duty to pull them from the printed page  to breathe life into them and to practise them every day. In everyday practice  it is not easy to uphold principles. It requires struggle and sacrifice. Some pay the ultimate price.  The world remembers Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld  who was killed 50 years ago this month. We honour him for his integrity  his principles and for his great courage in confronting power. We also remember that it was Canada’s Prime Minister  John Diefenbaker  who  just a year earlier  stood at this very    11-51390 30  rostrum to respond to unjust attacks against him. Canada did not hesitate to defend the Office and the person of the Secretary-General.  That is the Canadian tradition — standing for what is principled and just  regardless of whether it is popular  convenient or expedient. Over the past century  the world was infected by a lethal combination of utopian ideology and brutal despotism that spawned totalitarian regimes that enslaved their own peoples. Apologists tried to persuade us that the ideology of Communism was benign. Canadians knew better. We took a stand for freedom and fundamental human rights. We stood against oppression in Germany and in Ukraine. We stood with its brave people  and those of the other captive nations of central and Eastern Europe.  Canada does not go along in order to get along. We will go along only if we go in a direction that advances Canada’s values: freedom  democracy  human rights and the rule of law. Also  Canada would not go along to support the farce of a major proliferator of nuclear arms presiding over the Conference on Disarmament. When North Korea relinquished the presidency  we resumed our engagement in the Conference. Canada’s tough economic sanctions against that rogue regime remain in place  and we continue to advocate and advance reform in how the President of that important body is selected.  We would not go along with appeasement of the former Al-Qadhafi regime  nor would we look the other way when the Lockerbie mass murderer received a hero’s welcome and the Colonel’s embrace. We would not look the other way as the Al-Qadhafi regime  blatantly disregarding human rights and the rule of law  waged war on the people of Libya.  Canada backs our principles with action: providing military support to NATO’s Operation Unified Protector; recognizing the National Transitional Council as Libya’s transitional Government; co-founding the Libya Contact Group; and giving early  strong and continuing support to the Libyan people’s struggle against tyranny.  Canada would not simply go along or look elsewhere when the Al-Assad regime started killing Syrian men  women and children in a despicable and desperate attempt to cling to power. We imposed tough sanctions on the regime and its backers.  Canada will not go along with a double standard that castigates some United Nations Members for alleged failings  while ignoring the notorious abuses of others. We supported the aspirations of those peoples who sought brighter futures for themselves and their countries during the Arab spring that has just passed.  However  we will not go along with the unilateral actions of the Palestinian Authority. Just a few days ago  the Quartet laid the foundation for a return to negotiation. Our Government’s position has been clear — the only solution to the issue is one that is negotiated by the two parties themselves. We continue to encourage both sides to accept those principles and to return to direct talks  based on a two-State solution  without delay or precondition.   We uphold Israel’s right to exist. We uphold its fundamental right  like any Member State  to defend innocent civilians against acts of terrorism. Just as Fascism and Communism were the great struggles of previous generations  terrorism is the great struggle of ours. Far too often  the Jewish State is on the front line in our struggle and its people are the victims of terror.  Canada will not accept or stay silent while the Jewish State is attacked for defending its territory and its citizens. The Second World War taught us all the tragic price of going along just to get along. It was accommodation and appeasement that allowed Fascism to gather strength. As Winston Churchill said  an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile  hoping it will eat him last.  We respect State sovereignty  but Canada will not go along or look the other way when a minority is denied its human rights or fundamental freedoms. It is our common duty to uphold the rights of the afflicted and to give a voice to the voiceless.   As citizens of the global community  we have a solemn duty to defend the vulnerable  to challenge aggression and to protect and promote human rights and human dignity  at home and abroad: women  Christians  Baha’i and other victims of persecution in Iran; Roman Catholic priests  other Christian clergy and their laity  driven to worship underground in China; Christians being driven out of Iraq by Al-Qaida; and Copts being assaulted and killed in Egypt. In Burma  the regime discriminates against several forms of Buddhism and restricts the activities of Muslims. In other places  the Ahmadiyya community faces real violence. Gays and lesbians are threatened with the   31 11-51390  criminalization of their sexuality in Uganda  and other minorities are subjected to persecution  oppression or violence. Our nationalities are many but we share one humanity.  I am pleased to report that Canada will be creating an office of religious freedom within our Government at the heart of my own Department. The office will promote freedom of religion and of conscience as key objectives of Canadian foreign policy. The long history of humankind has proved that religious freedom and democratic freedom are inseparable. As Franklin Roosevelt observed on the eve of global war    “[w]here freedom of religion has been attacked  the attack has come from sources opposed to democracy. Where democracy has been overthrown  the spirit of free worship has disappeared. And where religion and democracy have vanished  good faith and reason in international affairs have given way to strident ambition and brute force”.   That brings me to Canada’s support of multilateral institutions and multilateral action. Some years ago  a former Secretary-General referred to enlightened multilateralism as the guarantor  not the enemy  of State sovereignty and the integrity of State. State sovereignty is not created by multilateral institutions. Instead  multilateral institutions exist and derive legitimacy from the independent decisions of sovereign States.  Canada’s position in that regard was explained by our Prime Minister just last year. Referring to multilateral action to address the world economic crisis  Stephen Harper said that he saw world leadership  at its best  as a glimpse of a hopeful future where we act together for the good of all; the world we have been trying to build since 1945; the world we want for our children and for our grandchildren. It can be done if we act together.   Enlightened sovereignty  multilateral institutions and multilateral action result from a collection of sovereign decisions based on individual States’ own interests  not narrow self-interest in sovereignty’s name  but an expanded view of mutual interest in which there is room for all to grow and for all to prosper. Canada calls that enlightened sovereignty. It is the natural extension of enlightened self-interest.  As Canada’s Prime Minister noted when he addressed the General Assembly last year  the United Nations Charter is animated by “the idea that what is good for others may well be the best way to pursue one’s own interests” (A/65/PV.11  p. 46) — in other words  enlightened sovereignty.  The world knows that we can accomplish great things by working together. This year  collective action under United Nations sanction helped to limit the loss of life in Libya and ultimately ended a criminal  illegitimate regime’s war on the people whom it claimed to represent. Canada was tremendously proud to take part in its demise. Our Royal Canadian Air Force flew 10 per cent of the total strike sorties against Al-Qadhafi’s forces and our Royal Canadian Navy helped enforce the maritime blockade.  Canada has paid heavily  both in dollar terms and in a costly human toll  to fulfil our United Nations obligation to support the lawful Government of Afghanistan. We used our chairmanship of the Group of Eight to reach out to leaders from Africa and the Americas and to secure an agreement to enact the Muskoka Initiative for maternal  newborn and child health.  That progress will help to meet the Millennium Development Goal of reducing the appalling mortality among mothers and children in developing countries. Working with like-minded nations  Canada continues to make significant financial contributions towards peace  humanitarian assistance  development aid and security in the Sudans. Collective action does not mean uniformity.  For example  Canada works closely with like-minded countries to advance human rights and democracy in Burma. At the same time  we imposed the toughest sanctions in the world against that country’s repressive military regime. Similarly  when Canada placed strong restrictions on Syria’s current regime  we acted independently  but in close consultation and cooperation with other nations.  In the defence of freedom and human rights  form cannot prevail over substance. The determinant is which route produces the best results. While multilateral action should be preferred  failure to achieve consensus must not prevent the willing from acting to uphold human rights and the founding principles of the United Nations.    11-51390 32   Margaret Thatcher was once reported to have said that “consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs  principles  values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes”. That leads to my third topic — the challenges to the relevance and the effectiveness of this important Organization.  Canada has been a consistently reliable and responsible participant in United Nations initiatives around the world. We are the seventh largest contributor to United Nations finances. The citizens of the world deserve that the United Nations abide by the same principles observed by so many Governments of Member States: accountability  transparency and ethics; financial responsibility and fiscal austerity; efficiency and the elimination of waste and duplication; regular reviews to sunset unnecessary  redundant and obsolete mandates; and zero tolerance for conflicts of interest  fraud and corruption.  Yet  the challenges faced by this Organization extend beyond financial probity and operational effectiveness. This Organization is a forum for debate and dialogue  but it must also be a force for positive action to make the world a better place. As a former Canadian Prime Minister  John Diefenbaker  told this Assembly during his defence of the world’s persecuted minorities: “We are not here in this Assembly to win wars of propaganda. We are here to win victories for peace.” (A/PV.871  para. 225)   The relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations are imperilled when the founding principles are observed in word but not in deed. Such is the case when the presidency of the Conference on Disarmament passes to a regime involved in the illicit transfers of weapons  material and technology; or when Iran  which mocks the values of this Organization through such outrages as refusing to allow entry to   United Nations observers on human rights  is permitted to seek leadership roles  such as the vice-presidency of the General Assembly and a seat on the Commission on Population and Development; or when objection is taken on petty  procedural or process-based grounds to reporting that speaks about credible allegations of war crimes committed in Sri Lanka; or when blatant violators of women’s rights are welcomed to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  often despite reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose of the very Convention.  Canada has consistently opposed the debasement of multilateral institutions by conduct that is inconsistent with their values. For example  this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Canada’s principled refusal to support membership in the Commonwealth of Nations by South Africa’s then apartheid regime.  The greatest enemies of the United Nations are not those who publicly repudiate its actions. The greatest enemies of the United Nations are those who quietly undermine its principles or  even worse  who sit idly  watching its slow decline. We cannot sit idly.  Canada is a vigorous defender of freedom  democracy and the rule of law. As our Prime Minister remarked earlier this month    “we are not a country that makes war for gain or for territory. We do not fight for glory. If we covet honour  it is only a reputation for doing the right thing in a good cause”.  That is all. That is enough. If I may be so bold  that is why the countries of the world came together in the United Nations - to do the right thing in a good cause. The cause is peace  justice  freedom and opportunity for all."
"31",1239,"CHE",66,2011,"How can we shape development policy that is of benefit to all? The per capita gross domestic product of Switzerland is 130 times higher than that of a country such as Mozambique. Why do the poorest countries benefit so little from globalization  and what can we do to change this? One-quarter of the world’s population consumes three-quarters of the available raw materials. How can we ensure that nearly 7 billion individuals have enough water  food and energy at affordable prices? And what happened to equity and social justice in the twenty-first century?  It is up to us together to find the answers to these questions. That will require us to have a sense of responsibility and to be ready to reflect together on norms  values and priorities.  More than any other international organization  the United Nations has the potential and the necessary    11-50692 50  conditions to support States in these efforts. Since its founding  the United Nations has developed into a dense institutional network. International governance remains fragmented and inefficient. Governance structures need to be strengthened if the United Nations is to succeed as the driving force towards sustainable development.  Events in the Arab world have been a reminder that democracy and sustainable development go hand in hand. Indeed  it was ultimately the lack of political freedom  combined with injustice and a lack of economic prospects  that unleashed the fundamental changes that have so surprised us. Many nations are facing difficult changes today and the fact that relations among States and between the region and the rest of the world need to be based on new principles. This is a challenge to the countries themselves and to the new social groups driving the change: youth  women  the emerging middle classes and civil society as a whole. But it is also a challenge to the countries and Governments of the region  as well as for us all as Members of the United Nations.  We must do our best to ensure that effective aid is provided quickly to the victims of unrest and violence. We must ensure that security and the rule of law are strengthened. We must contribute to inclusive political dialogue  promoting national reconciliation and legitimate efforts to create new constitutions. We must extend the authority of State institutions and restore public services. We must help to protect the human rights of all and support transitional justice. We must also support immediate economic recovery measures. Only through such a wide-ranging programme  backed by an international community in which each member is ready to make a constructive contribution  will it be possible to create more favourable conditions for sustainable development.  I note with regret that the spirit of optimism borne of the Arab Spring has not breathed new life into the Middle East peace process. We remember the words of President Obama before the General Assembly a year ago well — words that encouraged us to hope for change. For a few minutes  we dreamed together of   “the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire” (A/65/PV.11  p. 12).  We entertained the hope that  together with Palestine and Israel  we could succeed in reaching an agreement that would allow us to welcome a new Member to the United Nations — a sovereign and independent Palestine  living side by side in peace with Israel.  Somberly  we note instead that the past year has been a year of deadlock with no progress but stagnation  and even a hardening of positions. For more than 60 years  the international community has failed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The so-called peace process has replaced peace. In order to return peace to the centre of the stage  influential people on both sides have attempted to implement a tangible and lasting vision. We gave them our support and facilitated a model agreement. The Geneva initiative is today a consolidated  detailed proposal compatible with internationally accepted parameters  including the Arab Peace Initiative. It remains at the disposal of the decision-makers  as well as of the populations whose right it is to demand peace.  Preventing future wars was the goal of the founding of the United Nations. Today  it remains among the noblest objectives of this Organization. The past two decades have shown that the international community has every interest in finding ways to strengthen its efforts in the area of mediation. Indeed  it is in a negotiated solution rather than military victory that a lasting solution will be found for the majority of conflicts.   The Security Council plays an important role in the prevention of conflicts. Switzerland would welcome a stronger and more lasting commitment to preventive diplomacy on the part of the Security Council. If the Security Council is to be able to make a worthwhile contribution to peace and security  it must adapt to new realities and reflect the new political balance of power of the twenty-first century. I should also like it to be more transparent and open and to fulfil its duty of remaining accountable to the Member States.   Ultimately  the decisions of the Security Council have a direct impact on all States in ways that are legally binding. That is why Switzerland advocates  along with its partners in the so-called small five group  improvement of the Council’s working methods. The small five’s proposals are practical and concrete. They can be implemented immediately without any need to amend the United Nations Charter.    51 11-50692   However  the United Nations will be truly strengthened only if those countries that rightly insist on having greater participation also show themselves ready to accept greater responsibility for the Organization’s proper functioning and its financial situation.  The United Nations is unique in being the only Organization that offers all the countries of the world the opportunity to join together to address the whole range of international challenges to peace and security  ranging from the protection of human rights to sustainable development. Switzerland is ready to contribute  and we look forward to working together   with the new President of the General Assembly  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  whom I congratulate on his election and offer the full support of my country during this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly."
"32",1285,"CHL",66,2011,"I wish at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon on his recent reappointment as Secretary-General  and    11-50865 12  you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.   In this meeting of the United Nations  a multiplicity of countries and ethnicities  cultures and languages  religions and creeds converges. All are increasingly connected in this globalized world  because over and above our legitimate differences  we all live on the same planet  all breathe the same air and are all warmed by the same sun. As inhabitants of planet Earth  we share the same future. We share similar challenges and opportunities. All of us have the same desire for peace  freedom  justice and prosperity for our peoples and nations.  I come before the Assembly to express  with humble conviction  what my country has to say to the international community. But I have also come to listen  carefully and respectfully  to what other countries have to say to our country. Chile is  and will always be  proud to defend and promote dialogue as the best mechanism for dealing with and settling disputes. Chile profoundly believes that all nations  cultures  traditions and creeds have something to teach us. But we also believe that we all have something to learn from others.  There is no doubt that we are facing a new world — very different from the one we  or our parents  have known and which emerged forcefully during the past decades: a new world born of the revolutions of knowledge  technology and information that has created  and will continue to create  enormous opportunities for material and spiritual progress for billions of people throughout the world — opportunities the world has never known.   It is also certain that this new world presents us with new risks  challenges  threats and opportunities that exceed any Government’s individual potential and can only be addressed successfully through joint action. For example  financial crises  in addition to becoming more frequent each day  have increasing regional and global implications that cannot be ignored. The evils of modern society  such as terrorism  drug trafficking and organized crime  have for a long time ceased to heed borders  territories or jurisdictions. Any attempt to deal effectively with global warming  environmental protection  natural disasters  health emergencies  hunger and extreme poverty will most certainly require greater concerted and effective action from the community of nations and international bodies if we truly want to begin to change the course of history.   Consequently  today it is urgent that we reposition ourselves and reshape each international organization  many of which emerged in a very different world  during the post-war period. Today  as we all know  they lack the ability to provide the necessary effective responses to the realities  challenges and opportunities of the present  as well as those of the future that are beginning to emerge. There is no doubt that we have achieved significant progress  but we understand that it has been too slow and insufficient. We cannot pretend to lead this new world with old institutions. One day our children will ask us how to face these challenges. In the end  these are our challenges and we must deal with them now. If we do not  then who will? If not now  then when?  While it is true that this revolution of knowledge  technology and information is not the first revolution the world has faced  all of us know that it is the most far-reaching in magnitude and breadth  both in terms challenges and the opportunities it has provided. But like the revolutions of the past — of metals  agriculture or the industrial revolution — this twenty-first century revolution will be very generous vis-à-vis the countries with the desire to embrace it enthusiastically. But the revolution will continue to be indifferent  and even cruel  to those countries that decide simply to ignore it or let it pass by. It will therefore depend on us whether it will become a factor for freedom  unity and progress and a bridge to span the gap between developed countries and emerging nations or  on the contrary  a new factor of division and a new wall further separating those countries in the world of opportunity from those in the world of frustrations.  Certainly  the primary responsibility for rising up to greet this revolution that is already knocking at our doors lies with each country. But it is also a responsibility for the international community. In the case of the emerging countries  which include all those in Latin America  including my country  Chile  this signifies  in addition to a huge responsibility  a unique opportunity to re-identify with our past. Most important  it is an opportunity to meet up with our future. It is clear that Latin America — now celebrating 200 years of independence — has everything it needs to overcome poverty and underdevelopment. We have a large and fertile territory  abundant natural resources  two closely   13 11-50865  related languages and  most important  peoples who have demonstrated  with solidarity and vigour  their ability to overcome any obstacle placed in our way by nature or by Providence. We have not had wars such as those experienced by Europe in the past century  or ethnic or religious conflicts such as those affecting other regions of the world.   Nevertheless  because we did not know how to join the industrial revolution in time  our continent remains underdeveloped  with more than one third of its population living in conditions of poverty. However  Latin America has learned the lesson and is today becoming integrated with enormous conviction into this new revolution of modern society  science  technology  knowledge and information. This integration will be successful only if we are able to promote and expand what has been  and continues to be  the inexhaustible source of progress for humankind — freedom.  Freedom is an integral concept that cannot be divided or compartmentalized. Freedom must be expressed in all spheres of human life. In the political sphere  it requires us to revitalize and deepen democracy and the defence of human rights to the farthest corner of the planet and at any moment in time. In the economic sphere  this means fostering creativity  entrepreneurship and innovation among human beings  who are the only truly inexhaustible and renewable resource we possess. We must demolish all of the obstacles that are preventing many emerging nations from fully integrating themselves into the newly emerging world. In the social sphere  freedom means promoting peace and helping States to become ever more efficient and effective in the fight against poverty and in the creation of real societies that provide equal opportunities for all.  Chile has undoubtedly made  and will continue to make  important contributions to each of those areas. As well as strongly supporting the cause of democracy and defending human rights in all countries of the continent and of the world  where necessary  Chile has  at the regional level  been a tireless and steadfast advocate of improving the Inter-American Democratic Charter and of finalizing a protocol on the preventive protection of democracy within the Union of South American Nations.  In addition  we continue to actively participate in the negotiations on the reform of the Security Council to increase its permanent and non-permanent members in order to make it more representative of the realities of the new world order. We have also supported the reform of the Human Rights Council  to which Chile was recently re-elected.  With regard to economic issues  Chile is a country that has integrated into the world and has concluded free trade agreements with more than 58 countries on all continents  representing more than 80 per cent of the world’s population. However  our commitment to free trade does not stop there. We have been strong supporters of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization so as to make progress  once and for all after decades of stagnation  towards the liberalization of world trade  because protectionism is a poor response and is even worse when we face the threatening crisis conditions that we are experiencing today.   Moreover  with regard to the promotion of world peace  Chile has recognized the Palestinian State  a country that we hope to welcome to the Organization very soon. We have resolutely supported all international efforts to achieve a just  legitimate and lasting settlement in the Middle East. Chile is firmly convinced that the Palestinian people have the right to a free  sovereign and democratic State and that the State of Israel has the right to have recognized  secure and respected borders. Only thus will Palestinians and Israelis be able to coexist and move forward in peace and harmony.   With regard to social development and the fight against poverty  hunger and pandemics  we are strengthening South-South cooperation. Such cooperation is certainly triangular  but it neither replaces nor substitutes the need for North-South cooperation. We have set up and are implementing a Chilean fund to combat hunger and poverty in Africa. We have also made significant contributions to the United Nations International Drug Purchase Facility in order to combat HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  which still wreak havoc in many parts of the world. But we wish to go even further  and we are implementing mechanisms that will enable us to unilaterally reduce duties in order to promote our imports from relatively less developed African countries.  We were also very proud to strongly support UN-Women  an entity headed by our compatriot    11-50865 14  Michelle Bachelet  whose principal goal is as strong and as far-reaching as to ultimately ensure that  as women and men  we have the same rights and the same opportunities in this world  which belongs to us all.  However  in this new century and this new knowledge and information society  as well as relying on robust democracies  with open  competitive and integrated economies  and effective States to combat poverty and for greater equality of opportunity  we must recognize that those are merely old pillars that are necessary but completely inadequate today. As emerging countries  we must commit to building new development pillars. Those are investment in science and technology; the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship; the building of more flexible societies that can adapt to a world in which change is the only constant; and  above all  making a huge effort to improve our human capital  the education of our young people and the training of our workers  as that is surely the major source of wealth and primary resource for leaving behind underdevelopment.   There is no doubt that we must win the race for development and the battle for the future in the classroom by giving each and every one of our children quality education. We have said it many times: education is the true mother of all battles. Unfortunately  it is also the Achilles heel of many emerging economies. In my country in recent weeks  thousands of young people have taken to the streets to demonstrate for a noble  great and fine cause  namely  giving all children and young people quality education that enables them all to be actors in  and not mere spectators of  their own destiny and participation in this knowledge and information society.  Our Government has shared  and consistently shares  that goal. It is ready for the greatest reforms and has committed the largest economic  human  professional and technical resources in order to bring about fundamental change in our education system that seeks to substantially improve the quality of education and to increase coverage  in particular in the education of children from minorities and the most vulnerable so that they participate in education soon  not when the years have made it irreversible. We must also substantially increase funding and access at all levels of education in order to ensure something as simple as quality education for all  free education for all those who need it and adequate funding for all others in order to realize the dream that no bright child or young person remains excluded from higher education owing to the socio-economic situation of their family or to scarce resources.   We want to appeal to all Latin American countries  in the context of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  to establish a true strategic partnership that will engage the heart and soul of our Governments in that extensive reform of our educational systems  which will be our greatest possible contribution to the overall development of people to enable them to utilize their talents to the full  and to the growth of our economies  while enhancing peace and strengthening our democracies.   That is why I would also like to mention what the President of Bolivia said yesterday when he referred to his country’s claim to obtain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean through Chilean territory (see ). In that regard  I wish to reiterate that there are no territorial issues pending between Chile and Bolivia. They were settled once and for all by the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904  that is to say  concluded more than 100 years ago now. That Treaty was lawfully negotiated more than 20 years after the end of the conflict between the two countries. Moreover  the parties agreed to it; their Parliaments ratified it; and  as Bolivia itself acknowledged  the Treaty was the outcome of free and consensus-based negotiation. Therefore  in accordance with international law  both Chile and Bolivia are obliged to respect and implement it in good faith.   Chile has fully implemented in a timely way each and every clause of that 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Furthermore  the facilities that Chile granted exceeded the Treaty provisions  including going far beyond those that the United Nations itself established in the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States. Our country has been  and always will be  willing to engage in dialogue with Bolivia on the basis of full respect for the treaties and international law. We are sure that  through such dialogue  we will have the best possibility of agreeing with Bolivia concrete  feasible and useful solutions for both countries.   All of us here have not only the right but the duty to speak and act in defence of the interests of our respective countries and peoples. However  we cannot fail to note that  for that to be fruitful  requires that we work on the many things that unite us rather than on   15 11-50865  what legitimately divides us. When all is said and done  whether we like it or not  responding to the risks and the storm clouds that we see looming on the horizon — but also the challenges and the opportunities that we are getting ready to confront  and the responses and the solutions that together we shall have to implement  will only be fruitful and efficient if we do so with unity and goodwill. Some might believe that  acting alone  they will be able to move forward faster  but history will never cease to remind us that it is only when we act with unity and goodwill that we will be able to build on solid bedrock and not sand; only that will allow each country — and the world as a whole — to go far in fulfilling our tasks  achieving our goals and overcoming our challenges."
"33",1331,"CHN",66,2011,"I wish to begin by congratulating Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on having assumed the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I am confident that  with his outstanding ability and great experience  he will fulfil his lofty mission. I also wish to thank Mr. Deiss for his contribution as President at the previous session. I further wish to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on becoming the 193rd member of the United Nations family.   The first decade of the twenty-first century is now behind us. During that decade  the trend towards a multipolar world and economic globalization gained momentum. Countries became increasingly interdependent. Revolutions in science and technology brought profound transformations to human society. However  various traditional and non-traditional security threats and global challenges were intertwined with those changes  and the world was far from a peaceful place.   As the second decade of the new century begins  the world has entered an extraordinary historical stage in its pursuit of peace and development  and continues to undergo profound and complex changes. Uncertainty and instability are increasing despite the generally peaceful international environment. Development is becoming an increasingly serious issue  and promoting common development has become a more important and pressing task than ever before.  Global development is now at a new critical juncture. Global recovery remains fragile  international financial markets are volatile and the pursuit of sustainable development faces daunting challenges. The world economy therefore has to meet the crucial test of maintaining growth. Some countries in West Asia and North Africa are in continual political turmoil. Terrorist threats are spreading and global challenges growing. The international community faces a critical test in maintaining stability.   The gap in development between the South and the North is as wide as ever. The number of people living in absolute poverty has increased by 64 million owing to the international financial crisis. Nearly 1 billion people suffer from starvation. Urgent action is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It is imperative to step up international cooperation to help the least developed countries (LDCs) meet the basic needs of their people. In the face of these challenges  we share an important mission to achieve common development  and we also have rare new opportunities.   Economic globalization has made the interests of countries more closely interconnected. Ensuring security through cooperation and promoting development through stability has become our shared desire. Countries are addressing development challenges in innovative ways. To overcome the crisis  developed countries have taken steps to improve their fiscal conditions  adopted stimulus measures and accelerated economic structural adjustment. Developing countries as a whole have maintained good growth momentum. In particular  the rapid growth in some emerging economies has driven the growth of the world economy.   Progress has been made in the reform of the global economic governance structure  and various regional cooperation mechanisms are expanding. Efforts to accelerate the development of a green economy and explore new modes of sustainable growth have created new momentum and space for common development. Faced with new opportunities and challenges  we should work as a team to overcome our difficulties and pursue mutual benefit and common development. This is the responsibility and mission that history bestows upon all of us. To fulfil our mission  we need to take the following steps.   We should foster sound momentum for global economic recovery. The underlying impact of the international financial crisis has yet to dissipate  and economic recovery is still fragile and uneven. We should intensify consultation and coordination  and send a strong message of solidarity and win-win cooperation so as to strengthen international confidence in global recovery and growth. We should work for a fair  just  inclusive and orderly international monetary and financial system  and promote the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing countries.   China supports the transition of the Group of 20 (G-20) from a short-term crisis response mechanism to a long-term mechanism of economic governance. The G-20 should play a bigger role in global economic governance and in promoting the full recovery and growth of the world economy.     11-51384 42   We support the efforts of emerging markets to explore new modes of international economic cooperation. We strongly oppose protectionism in all its forms and call for strengthening the multilateral trading regime. The concerns of the least developed countries should be addressed  and efforts made to make the Doha Round achieve its development objectives.  We should lay the political foundation for cooperative development. All countries  big or small  strong or weak  rich or poor  are equal members of the international community  and their equal right to development should be protected. Mutual respect and equality are the basic norms governing international relations and constitute an important guarantee for common development. In the current context  it is of particular and practical importance to adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  to uphold the authority and role of the United Nations  to observe in good faith the principle of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs  and to promote democracy in international relations.   We should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. The internal affairs of each country should be decided by its own people. We oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs by whatever means and under whatever pretext.   The diversity of the world is a valuable asset for the development of human society. It should be seen as a positive factor that allows countries to learn from one another  and should not be used as an excuse for the big to bully the small or the rich to ride roughshod over the poor in international relations. We should respect the right of each country to pursue the development path of its choice and we should respect the diversity of civilizations. We should seek common progress by drawing on one another’s strength with an open and inclusive mind  pursuing common ground while preserving differences.  We should foster a security environment conducive to stability and development. History has repeatedly shown that stability and development go hand in hand. Without stability  there can be no development; without development  there can be no stability. In keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  we should always use peaceful means to settle international disputes and hotspot issues. We should oppose the wilful use or threat of force  terrorism  separatism and extremism in all their forms  and we should uphold the common security of humankind.  China respects the independent choice of the people of the Sudan and South Sudan  and hopes that the new-born country of South Sudan will enjoy stability and development. The international community should continue to support and encourage the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their outstanding issues appropriately through dialogue and consultation  pursue amicable relations and common development  and uphold regional peace and stability. China has encouraged the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their dispute through peaceful negotiation and has worked hard to advance the peace process between them. We support the proper settlement of the Darfur issue. We will continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role in advancing regional peace  stability and development.  China has consistently supported the just cause of establishing an independent Palestinian State  and supports Palestine’s membership in the United Nations. We support efforts to achieve a two-State solution through political negotiation so as to establish  on the basis of the 1967 borders  an independent Palestinian State that enjoys full sovereignty  with East Jerusalem as its capital. We believe that progress should be made in parallel in the peace talks between Syria and Israel and Lebanon and Israel  with an ultimate view to achieving a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East along with peaceful coexistence between the Arab countries and Israel. We hope that the international community and the parties concerned will make unremitting efforts to this end and sustain the Middle East peace process.  China is greatly concerned about the turbulence in West Asia and North Africa. We stand for the principle of non-interference. We respect and support the efforts of countries in those regions to independently handle their internal affairs  and we respect their aspirations. We hope that the parties concerned will resolve their differences through political dialogue and speedily restore stability and order in their respective countries.   Libya has now entered a critical transition from a state of war and turmoil to national reconstruction. China respects the choice of the Libyan people and recognizes the National Transitional Council (NTC) as   43 11-51384  the governing authority of Libya and the representative of its people. We hope that  under the leadership of the NTC  the parties in Libya will launch an inclusive process of political transition through which they will maintain ethnic harmony and national unity  restore stability as soon as possible and begin economic reconstruction. China supports the leading role of the United Nations in Libya’s post-conflict reconstruction  and urges the speediest possible operationalization of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya.   China is also greatly concerned about developments in Syria. We hope that parties in Syria will exercise restraint  avoid all violence  further bloodshed and conflict  and act quickly to ease tensions. We believe that a Syria-led  inclusive political process aimed at promoting reform through dialogue and consultation is the right way to resolve the current crisis in Syria. The international community should respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Syria  and address the Syrian issue cautiously so as to prevent further turbulence and repercussions on regional peace.  China welcomes the positive developments on the Korean peninsula. We believe that dialogue and consultation are the only effective way to address the issues of the peninsula. The Six-Party Talks are an effective mechanism for advancing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and for upholding peace and stability both on the peninsula and in North-East Asia.   China has worked hard to promote peace through dialogue  and has played a unique role in easing tensions and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. China welcomes the recent resumption of dialogue between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea  as well as between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States. We hope that the parties concerned will seize the opportunity  remain engaged in dialogue and work for an early resumption of the Six-Party Talks.  We should promote balanced development between the South and the North. The uneven development between South and North is the biggest imbalance in the global economy. Without balanced development  there can hardly be sustainable development. Unless underdeveloped countries shake off poverty and grow their economies  there can be no common global prosperity.   Achieving the Millennium Development Goals on a global scale and on schedule is an urgent and arduous task. Developed countries should honour their commitments on official development assistance  open their markets  reduce and cancel debt  and their step up financial and technological support to developing countries. International financial institutions should use their resources to help developing countries  and particularly the LDCs  on a priority basis. Developing countries  on their part  should explore growth models that are conducive to development and poverty alleviation in order to achieve a higher level of development.  Food security has emerged as a major challenge. The Horn of Africa is suffering from massive famine triggered by the most severe drought in 60 years. The international community should scale up assistance  stabilize the price of food and other commodities  and help developing countries enhance their capacity for autonomous development so that all countries and regions can enjoy the benefits of common development.  The world witnessed major development  transformation and adjustment in the first decade of the twenty-first century. During this period  China enjoyed sustained and fast development  and its relations with the outside world underwent profound changes. China’s achievements in development  and its possible future course  have become a focus of international attention. Over the past 10 years  China’s economy continued to grow  and its people’s living standards rose markedly  thanks to the hard work of the Chinese people. Today  China has become the world’s second-largest economy  largest exporter  second-largest importer and largest emerging market. The basic living needs of China’s 1.3 billion people are being adequately met  and the number living in absolute poverty has fallen drastically.  On the other hand  the difficulties China faces in terms of development should not be ignored. We remain a developing country with a large population  a weak economic foundation and serious imbalances and lack of coordination in our development. China will have to make persistent and strenuous efforts to achieve its development goals. Guided by our recently adopted twelfth five-year plan for economic and social development  we will pursue scientific development  accelerate the shift in our growth model  advance scientific and technological innovation and increase    11-51384 44  reforms and openness designed to promote long-term  steady and fast economic development  as well as social harmony and progress. The world will see a more open China  with more sustainable development and greater social harmony.  China’s development has brought real benefits to the Chinese people and contributed to global development and prosperity. During the past 10 years  China imported close to  on average  $750 billion worth of goods annually  creating more than 14 million jobs for the relevant countries and regions. At the end of the twelfth five-year period in 2015  China’s total economic output will be around $8.6 trillion. It is expected that China will import about $10 trillion in goods in the next five years  which will further boost world economic growth. China needs the world in order to be able to continue to develop  and China’s development will in turn contribute more to the shared development of the world as a whole.  As a developing country  China is committed to enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation with other developing countries  based on equality  and to enhancing its efforts to provide them with assistance and support. China has cancelled 380 debts incurred by 50 heavily indebted poor countries and LDCs  and will phase in zero-tariff treatment for 95 per cent of exports from the African LDCs with which China has diplomatic relations. We have completed more than 2 100 projects  including building schools and hospitals  in other developing countries  and trained 150 000 professionals in various fields for them. In sympathy with the pain of the countries and people in the Horn of Africa hit by famine  China has decided to provide those countries with RMB443.2 million in emergency food assistance and cash for purchasing food to help them overcome the famine.  China has made notable efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. As it continues to develop  China will create more opportunities for world peace  development and cooperation. To advance common development  we must foster a sound international environment. Over the years  China has been dedicated to creating a peaceful international environment in which it can develop. At the same time  it has contributed to enhancing world peace through its own development. China has actively assumed international responsibilities as its capacity permits  and has worked to promote the peaceful settlement of issues in troubled areas.   China participates actively in international peacekeeping operations; with a total of more than 19 000 personnel deployed in 28 United Nations peacekeeping missions  China is the largest contributor of United Nations peacekeeping personnel among Security Council permanent members. China has provided assistance in cash and kind to countries hit by earthquakes and tsunamis  and has sent rescue teams to carry out humanitarian relief operations in the affected areas. China is actively involved in the fight against piracy and in other areas of international cooperation. All these efforts have contributed to maintaining world peace and stability.  The tide of history is surging forward. In the next decade  peace  development and cooperation will remain trends of the times  and China will not waver in its pursuit of development and progress. Peaceful development is the strategic choice that China has made to build a modern  strong and prosperous country and to make a greater contribution to the progress of human civilization. China will stay on that path  pursuing an independent  peaceful foreign policy and a win-win strategy of opening up its society.  We are committed to achieving a better life for the Chinese people and greater development and prosperity for all humankind. We will achieve those goals through hard work  reforms and innovation  and by conducting long-term friendly exchanges and establishing equality-based  win-win cooperation with other countries. A prosperous  harmonious and stable China that lives up to its responsibilities will make a greater contribution to the prosperity and stability of the world and the common development of humankind. Let us work together to deepen cooperation and achieve development by sharing opportunities and meeting challenges together  and thus build a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity."
"34",1365,"CIV",66,2011,"In taking the floor for the first time before this Assembly  I offer my heartfelt thanks to the international community and all the friendly countries that had faith in our struggle for democracy  and whose support never failed us during the painful and trying post-electoral crisis in Côte d’Ivoire.  Please also allow me  Mr. President  to congratulate you warmly  as other speakers before me have done  on your outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  which attests to the recognition of your remarkable contribution to expanding the influence of the Organization and promoting its ideals. We assure you of my delegation’s full support in carrying out your mandate. I would also like to convey to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  my full appreciation and that of my delegation for his remarkable work and encouraging results during his presidency.  I would further like to make a special mention here of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his determined commitment and tireless efforts on behalf of world peace  earning him deserved reappointment to a second term at the head of the United Nations. In reiterating my warm congratulations upon your re-election  I would also like to reaffirm  on behalf of the Ivorian people and Government  as well as personally  our profound gratitude and thanks for the crucial role the United Nations and you personally played in resolving the Ivorian crisis.  I note with satisfaction that  for the first time in history  a woman — Ms. Dilma Rousseff  democratically elected in 2010 to lead Brazil — opened our general debate. I celebrate this fact.  The theme chosen for this session — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” — demonstrates our will to place our Organization at the heart of international crisis resolution. It also focuses the attention of our Assembly on one of the main missions entrusted to the United Nations — the use and promotion of negotiations in the resolutions of conflicts  whose proliferation and gravity have posed an unrelenting threat to the balance and progress of humankind in recent years. The implementation of such an approach in international relations calls for resolute involvement and solidarity on the part of Member States in seeking negotiated solutions to current and potential disputes at the international  regional and subregional levels. In this regard  I welcome the independence of South Sudan and its admission as the 193rd State Member of the United Nations.  The recent history of peoples underscores the virtues of dialogue and negotiation for resolving even the most complex conflicts  as proven by the dismantling of apartheid and the progress  albeit modest  in the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.  This is a theme close to our hearts  as the father of the Ivorian nation  President Félix Houphouët-Boigny  left his mark on the history of Côte d’Ivoire and the entire African continent as a result of his pragmatic approach to resolving conflicts through dialogue. The UNESCO Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize attests to and represents the international community’s recognition of his efforts to promote peace. I am therefore honoured and proud to make a    11-50865 10  commitment to follow in the footsteps of the approach promoted by that apostle disciple of dialogue and peace. In this context  my country is fully ready  as in the past  to tirelessly promote the option of negotiation to resolve and prevent conflicts and safeguard peace — a prerequisite for all social and economic development in the world.  The much sought prize of peace  even through the appropriate routes of consultation and dialogue  cannot be achieved without more balanced and fairer economic development in our world. In this regard  the economic and financial crisis that has shaken the world for three years and whose consequences are still being felt  especially in developing countries  demands action  even as growth becomes more apparent in some regions. This trend has been growing since 2010  due in part to the economic performance of emerging and developing countries  must absolutely be consolidated if we want to sustainably prevent the relapse of such a crisis.   Nevertheless  strong economic growth is not enough to guarantee security and stability in our world. It must necessarily be accompanied by transparent and equitable access to employment  especially for young people  security and justice if we truly want to break the cycles of political and criminal violence. We must therefore urgently adopt a new model for development based on environmental constraints that ensures that the needs of the population for employment  security and justice are met. Such a challenge can be overcome only through solidarity.  The food  energy and environmental crises and natural disasters  which have become ever more frequent and serious due to the effects of climate change  demonstrate that the balance of human life  despite the immense progress achieved in a great number of areas  remains fragile. They also underscore how closely the fates of the peoples of the world are linked  as no geographic  racial or religious division can withstand either the occurrence or the negative effects of these phenomena. Aware of our responsibilities to our people and  above all  to humankind as a whole  we must therefore join forces through the multilateral framework to seek innovative and effective solutions to these crises and other catastrophes  which pose a real threat to international peace and security.  In this regard  I would like to reiterate the compassion of the people and Government of Côte d’Ivoire to the victims of natural disasters  especially in Japan  the Caribbean and the United States. I extend special and brotherly sympathy to the peoples of the Horn of Africa  who are suffering the grave effects of famine as a result of an extended drought.  Faced with these humanitarian tragedies  the political commitment of all States Members of the United Nations is indispensable. My delegation therefore welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the international community — especially the French presidency of the Group of 20  and the specialized institutions of the United Nations and the African Union — to meet the immediate needs of the affected populations.  International peace and security remain a cause of major concern for our Organization  given the proliferation of armed conflicts  nuclear threats  terrorist activity  transnational crime  human trafficking  drug trafficking and pandemics. All of these hamper the world’s harmonious development  especially in Africa  which  riven by many areas of tension  struggles to ensure its economic and social development despite its enormous potential.  The United Nations has a role to play in strengthening the international solidarity that is indispensable as we seek effective and appropriate solutions to these crises. This requires the mobilization of adequate resources to fund research and development in the areas of food crop production  renewable energy and sustainable development. To that end  a substantial reduction in military spending is required  allowing such resources to be found. Such a sacrifice would be very useful towards the survival of mankind.  Aware of these crises  since taking office I have sought to enhance the security of my country. Discussions are nearing completion on tripartite agreements with our neighbours  particularly Liberia — with which one has already been signed — Ghana and Guinea  with the support of the High Commissioner for Refugees and United Nations peacekeepers present in the region. These agreements seek to ensure the voluntary and rapid return of Ivorian refugees from those brotherly countries and to protect our eastern and western borders from the movement of   11 11-50865  armed groups  drug trafficking and traffic in precious metals.  Negotiations are also under way with our Western partners to ensure that Côte d’Ivoire becomes a bulwark of regional defence and security in the fight against terrorism. The recent ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict reinforces our firm resolve to use all legal means to combat violence and to protect the security of our most vulnerable people  particularly women and children.  The outcome of the social and political conflict that began in Côte d’Ivoire in 2002 marks the return of democracy to our country  based on the promise of the rule of law and a society that shares the common ideals of peace and respect for human rights. For that reason  coexistence is the cornerstone of my Government’s programme. As soon as I took office  I established national reconciliation as one of our priorities by creating a Dialogue  Truth and Reconciliation Commission designed to create conditions conducive to dialogue among all levels of society in order to heal the wounds of the crisis  re-knit the social fabric  restore national cohesion and promote peace and justice.  Furthermore  the Government  which is responsible for making those principles the basis for its activities  is working tirelessly to ensure social and economic recovery towards the reconstruction Côte d’Ivoire. Thus  the President’s emergency programme launched in March  while I was at the Golf Hotel  has already had favourable results for the people of Côte d’Ivoire  particularly those of Abidjan  who suffered pillage and property destruction. The programme is focused in particular on improving basic social services  especially the provision of drinking water  health care  education  electricity and public sanitation  which are major challenges that must be met as we attempt to achieve our Millennium Development Goals.  The organization of parliamentary elections before the end of this year will allow us to enhance democracy and social justice in Côte d’Ivoire  with the support and assistance of the United Nations through Security Council resolution 2000 (2011) of 27 July 2011  which demonstrates again the Organization’s determination to support Côte d’Ivoire until the end of the crisis as provided by the Ouagadougou Political Agreement.  The socio-political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire over the past 10 years has undermined the economic and social development of my country. It is my ambition  as we approach 2020  to make Côte d’Ivoire an emerging nation  reconciled with itself and with other nations and united by republican values; a modern State that respects the independence of the judiciary and will combat impunity and ensure the promotion of merit and competence.  In closing on this note of hope for my country  I call for the determined and ongoing involvement of all States Members of the United Nations in the pursuit  through dialogue and cooperation  of collective  effective and lasting solutions that will create a better world based on more harmonious and secure forms of development.  Côte d’Ivoire  which in the past was often called on to help in the quest for peaceful solutions to conflicts  intends to take up this vocation once again. This is a natural mission for us in many respects  because Côte d’Ivoire  as Félix Houphouët-Boigny said  is the friend of all and the enemy of none."
"35",1408,"CMR",66,2011,"First  on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya  President of the Republic and Head of State of Cameroon  and on behalf of the delegation that I have the honour to lead at the current session  I warmly congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  To Mr. Joseph Deiss  his predecessor  we wish to say how much his work as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session was appreciated  just as Cameroon appreciated his visit to Yaoundé in January during his African visit.  We also once again sincerely congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on the extension of his mandate as Secretary-General for a further five years. His determination and commitment to the United Nations during his first term of office contributed to the initiatives and important actions of the United Nations to promote peace and social and economic development throughout the world. He will have our best wishes and constant support during his second term  when we hope that he will successfully continue his  work in every area within the framework of the United Nations agenda  particularly in terms of aligning and harmonizing the points of view of the various Member States.   This year a new Member  the Republic of South Sudan  joined the Organization. We had the opportunity to solemnly  but joyfully  welcome it on 14 July  following its declaration of independence a few days earlier. The arrival of this new State allows a dark chapter to be closed: decades of war  with a litany of woes  death  displaced persons  tears  human tragedy and suffering among the people of that land on our African continent.   Cameroon takes the opportunity to join in paying a well-deserved tribute to the leaders of the Sudan and of South Sudan  as well as to the United Nations and the African Union  for their tireless work in supporting the negotiations before the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in 2005  as well as during its subsequent implementation. The United Nations Mission in the Sudan and the recent creation of the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan  whose task it is to support the new State in the process of consolidating its institutions and democracy  show the unique  decisive role played by the United Nations  fully in line with the fundamental purposes and principles of its founding Charter.  Cameroon welcomes the role that the United Nations has played in that regard. In more general terms  we believe that its role in conflict management should be played in a fully transparent way and in line with the principles  purposes and ideals of the Charter  which calls for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and for respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.   That is where the theme selected for this sixty-sixth session — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes through peaceful means” — takes on its importance  reminding us that the Charter states that the Organization’s primary purpose is   “To maintain international peace and security  and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace  and to bring about by peaceful means  and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace”.  The Charter also calls upon Members of the United Nations to     11-51378 16   “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state  or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”  International disputes  and a fortiori internal conflicts  should be settled peacefully in line with our Charter  through negotiation and mediation  rather than by recourse to force.   That is the position that the African Union  the continental organization of African States  ceaselessly advocates and defends. Cameroon agrees with the African Union that any lasting solution to an internal political crisis must take into account the State’s national political institutions and the legitimate aspirations of the people concerned  but also the maintenance of the country’s unity and territorial integrity. It considers that priority must be given to measures that guarantee the maintenance of peace  the promotion of national reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic culture and ownership of the rule of law by Governments and citizens.  With regard to some current burning questions in this area  and particularly with regard to management of the Libyan issue  Cameroon noted the General Assembly decision on 19 September approving the mandate of the Libyan delegation established by the National Transitional Council  as well as the statement made here by the Chairperson of the African Union Council on 21 September  which was preceded by the 19 September press release. Fully in line with our external policy  Cameroon will respect the decision and statement in the context of its bilateral relations with the Libyan State  and within various international institutions.  It is the international community’s duty to support States and their peoples in the management of their national affairs  and in seeking to ensure that they control their own fate. Governments  for their part  must seek to respond to the legitimate aspirations and the many and varied expectations of their peoples in all areas.   In Cameroon the Government is seeking to implement the reforms that began a few years ago to consolidate national political institutions and modernize our democracy. At the same time  it has established policies to create an environment favourable to development and revenue-generating activities and to improve the living conditions of its people  in a context of repeated international economic and financial crises  which have disturbing effects on the national programmes of States.  In economic terms  my country has had since 2009 a real moral compass for national players  both public and private  and for our external partners: the Growth and Employment Strategy document. The document is part of a comprehensive shared vision of development for Cameroon up to 2035  called Vision 2035. It emphasises seeking increased growth  job creation  poverty reduction and a tangible improvement in the living conditions of our people. The strategy will be implemented by  in particular  large-scale  labour-intensive building projects throughout the country  with particular emphasis on the energy sectors  mining and the creation of human capital.  In political terms  and with regard to elections  our independent electoral institution — Elections Cameroon (ELECAM) — set up in 2006 and made responsible for the entire electoral process  from the electoral register to the organization of the ballot  the oversight of elections and referendums  has become fully operational  and has a number of local offices.  Giving the right to vote to Cameroonians living abroad is part of the law that was promulgated this year. The electoral register has been updated by ELECAM  and incentives  such as free national identity cards  were given to encourage a large turn-out at the elections. Furthermore  legal provisions have been established to ensure the transparency  freedom  honesty and credibility of the elections in a context of consensual democracy.   In that regard  there is a deadline of importance to the Cameroonian people in the short term. On 9 October they will have the right to elect their leader and determine their future  as is the case in all democracies. I am referring to the presidential election. With all of the provisions that I have just mentioned  made with the technical assistance of United Nations specialized agencies  we believe that the conditions now exist to ensure that the election takes place peacefully. Independent national and foreign observers will be authorized to monitor the presidential election.   I wish to highlight with pride the political maturity demonstrated by the people of Cameroon. They have always been able to make the best choice in order to ensure that we preserve national achievements    17 11-51378  particularly with regard to peace and national unity  and the people have been able to work together in a spirit of patriotism  and with a high sense of a citizen’s responsibilities when required to meet the various challenges  both external and internal  that they encounter and have encountered throughout their history.  I reiterate Cameroon’s commitment to peace through mediation  as well as its commitment to democracy and good governance  both internally and internationally.   I close by emphasizing my country’s commitment to the ideals of the Charter  and to those set out in the Constitutive Act of the African Union. My country wishes to see enhanced cooperation between those two international institutions  as they deal with issues affecting African countries  in line with the spirit and letter of those two international instruments.   This has been  on behalf of the President of the Republic of Cameroon  His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya  Head of State and head of Cameroonian diplomacy  our contribution to the general debate at the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  which is our common international Organization with global competence."
"36",1452,"COD",66,2011,"Allow me  at the outset  to commend the President of the General Assembly and his whole team for their election to the Bureau of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We would like to express to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  our gratitude for the excellent work he accomplished  work that has benefited our Organization. I also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the Secretary-General  on the renewal of his mandate.  Taking the floor from this rostrum has always been for me a special moment and a happy occasion to recall some current issues of importance to my country and the world. This moment is all the more special as it comes at a time when the Democratic Republic of the Congo is preparing to hold general elections  the second since those of 2006.  Thus  it is appropriate to grasp the full significance of this key period for the Congo  because it confirms a definitive break from the spiral of violence and instability that has characterized the country in recent decades. It is seen as a decisive phase in that  more than ever  it commits the Congolese people to a lasting democratic culture.   Despite multifaceted challenges punctuating the electoral process  the National Independent Electoral Commission  our people and their Government are doing their utmost to hold transparent and credible elections in a calm climate. The elections are ultimately proof of a return to the effective peace for which Congolese men and women have yearned. Today  peace and security reign throughout the national   25 11-50871  territory. The Republic’s institutions are all in place and operating normally.  As peace and security in my country have been recovered  the United Nations presence merits reconsideration. Indeed  the role of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) must necessarily adapt its vision and its action on the ground. In that phase of consolidation  MONUSCO must increasingly move beyond the strict format of peacekeeping operations in order to assist the country in its efforts to develop and to relaunch the economy.  Enormous progress has certainly been made in the areas of peace and security. However  many other challenges remain  and the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to meet them. The mobilization and support of all should be along those lines. I refer in particular to the following areas of concerns: strengthening the capacity of the security sector  the army  the police  the judiciary and penitentiary systems to ensure the rights and security of citizens and to stabilize the country and the region; the increasing and orderly return of displaced persons to their places of origin and of refugees to their respective countries; the ongoing demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers leaving armed groups; effective control over the exploitation of our natural resources; and building good-neighbourly relations with the States around us.   In that regard  after several years of conflict the countries in the region have reached the conclusion that war is the worst enemy of man and his development. It exacerbates problems rather than resolves them. That explains their common will and our efforts to seek peace at all costs. That is the reality today. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is at peace with all its neighbours. Now is the time for reconstruction and development.  In that regard  I would like to welcome the recent entry of the Republic of South Sudan as a Member State of our universal Organization and to convey to its people my most heartfelt wishes for peace  happiness and prosperity.  Another challenge that my country must face is that of maintaining economic growth. Despite a difficult international climate  today the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows a positive growth rate above the African average  and it will continue that momentum thanks to the efforts to harness its economy. However  it is also true that such growth remains dependent  to a large degree  on the global economy.  Having spoken about the situation in my country  I would now like to address some big issues of current concern.   The United Nations has responded to a good number of challenges that justified its establishment at the end of the Second World War. In 66 years  the world has changed greatly  and the pace of change increases every day.   A great institution such as ours cannot remain static while its setting constantly changes. The time has come to envisage adapting the Organization to current realities so as to improve its effectiveness and  above all  to bolster confidence among Member States. To do that  it must make substantial progress in the major areas of a reform too long awaited  whether the revitalization of the General Assembly  reform of the Security Council or the role of the Economic and Social Council  which needs to be strengthened. A Security Council that incorporates equally the legitimate aspirations of developing countries  particularly those of Africa  would certainly be more legitimate.  Furthermore  the issues of climate change and the protection of nature demand a changed approach that takes into account the aspirations of all peoples. That is an area where it is prudent to demonstrate a spirit of compromise and solidarity in the interest  of course  of all countries.   That is also the case for the crucial goals of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  which remain hostage to the policy of double standards  such as discriminatory practices and non-compliance with commitments made  in particular by certain nuclear Powers.  The fight against impunity and against human rights violations  which is subjected to a selective approach and the partisan implementation of international humanitarian law  gives rise to legitimate doubts about the exploitation of these noble causes for political ends. Our Organization must address these issues.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo believes that the Israeli-Palestinian question should be a major concern for our universal Organization. The United    11-50871 26  Nations should unflaggingly continue its efforts to find an equitable solution that bears in mind the legitimate interests of two peoples  each with the right to live in peace and security. The Middle East cannot recover peace and stability without a fair and lasting settlement of this question.   I would not continue my remarks without mentioning the more active cooperation that we would like to see between the African Union and the United Nations in the area of conflict management. It is advisable  in my humble opinion  that we strengthen this cooperation and make better use of it in order to reduce the number of hot spots on our continent. We all stand to gain.  I have focused my remarks today on the need to strengthen peace. That is the essential precondition for all progress  but a peace limited to an absence of stomping boots is not peace. Without ignoring the successes  it must be said that in this area our Organization still has an enormous amount to do to ensure that each and every person is able to participate in the progress of all of humanity.  I conclude by renewing our wishes to see the concept and management of international affairs modified through an effective and sincere commitment of the entire community of nations for a renewal and strengthening of the multilateral system."
"37",1499,"COG",66,2011,"I am honoured to take the floor from this rostrum on behalf of the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso.  This past week  in this place  we took part in High-level Meetings that addressed the major concerns at the very heart of the actions of the United Nations and those of its Member States: non-communicable disease; the situation in Libya; desertification  land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and the eradication of poverty; the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action on Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; nuclear safety; and terrorism. Clearly  the conclusions that we reached at those meetings reflect not only the political will and commitment of Member States to provide collective responses to those concerns  but also corroborate our faith in multilateralism.   In unison we have welcomed the Republic of South Sudan  and we congratulate them on concluding  after many years of patience  the long and laborious process of negotiation that brought us the 193rd State Member of the United Nations. In joining the warm words of welcome expressed by the delegations before me  I wish to reiterate the Congo’s support for this young brother country and to underscore the commitment of my Government to develop close ties of friendship and cooperation with it.   Since its creation  the United Nations has put a great deal of effort into the noble endeavour of freeing peoples still under the yoke of colonialism and domination. The history of the United Nations is intertwined with the emancipation of peoples. The time has therefore come to do justice to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. The Congo hopes to see a sovereign Palestinian State emerge  master of its own fate  in this great universal family  within secure and guaranteed borders and living in peace alongside the people of the State of Israel in a spirit of good neighbourliness and cooperation.  With respect to the situation in Libya  particularly as regards the consequences for the subregion  we agree that the restoration of peace and security remains a high priority. For this reason  I wish to express my Government’s support for the United Nations Support Mission in Libya.  In the quest for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis  the Congo  together with other African States members of the Ad Hoc High-level Committee of the African Union  urges the authorities of the National Transitional Council to meet their commitments  particularly with respect to preserving national unity; involving all Libyan stakeholders  without exception  in rebuilding the country; protecting foreigners  particularly African migrant workers; and opening an inclusive political process for ending the crisis.   In our immediate neighbourhood  both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroun will hold major elections in several weeks. My delegation would like to see that process take place smoothly  in calm and peace  in order to help democracy take root and to strengthen political stability.  The intolerable situation in the non-State of Somalia and the ongoing civil war that has been under way for 20 years  along with the unprecedented humanitarian crisis  once again challenge the international community. We encourage the Transitional Federal Government to continue and strengthen its efforts to achieve peace within the framework of the Djibouti Agreement  with the participation of all groups that wish to cooperate  and to renounce armed violence. Here  I would like to commend the actions of the African Union Mission to Somalia  particularly for having made it possible to secure Mogadishu.  We welcome the wave of international solidarity for the Horn of Africa. In keeping with this   9 11-51398  momentum  the Congo has made a contribution for the victims of the drought in Somalia.  The President has properly placed the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes at the centre of the general debate. For the prevention and resolution of conflicts  this is indeed a necessary tool that has proven itself over the years and in all areas.   The experience of mediation in Africa since the independence of the African States is replete with lessons regarding the role of this mechanism in settling the numerous internal crises or inter-State conflicts that our countries have experienced. In the past  the Organization of African Unity used meditation almost systematically. Today  the African Union continues to benefit from it. Furthermore  mediation is consistent with the African culture and tradition of dialogue. It is by drawing from the very source of this tradition that the Congo was able to launch a productive internal dialogue that enabled it to overcome the socio-political turmoil of the 1990s.  The relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter enshrine the obligation of Member States to seek  in any dispute    “a solution by negotiation  enquiry  mediation  conciliation  arbitration  judicial settlement  resort to regional agencies or arrangements  or other peaceful means of their own choice”.  These provisions offer a wide range of possibilities from among which to select the means appropriate to bring about a peaceful settlement.  Today more than ever  the quest for peace by negotiation remains the only way to guarantee lasting peace. The threat or use of force should be considered only after having exhausted all possible political solutions. The Security Council should therefore strictly limit the conditions under which the use of force is authorized so as to avoid any manipulation or deterioration of a situation.   Similarly  the abuse of the international justice system  which has become a political weapon targeting Africa in particular  is a dangerous aberration that must be corrected.  Beyond its main theme  the current session is being held  as have preceding sessions  at a time in our shared history when the United Nations is solidly mobilized around its three main pillars of activity  namely  international peace and security  economic development and sustainable development  as well as the related aspects of protecting the environment and human rights. With respect to the range of challenges old and new that the United Nations is expected to meet  it will be viewed as effective and legitimate only if it adapts to the new realities of our world.  United Nations reform is therefore urgent. It must be based on the principles of democracy  justice and equality. The position of the African Union on Security Council reform is well known in this body. The reforms will be contingent on the willingness of all Member States to make the Organization an institution that embodies modern values and that is open to the future.  In order for the United Nations to effectively and efficiently fulfil its key role in steering global affairs  its Member States must carry out reforms  first to restore the central role of the General Assembly as the most representative deliberative body  and then to foster the participation of more developing countries in the decision-making process.   The global challenges identified by heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit  held in September 2000  include sustainable development and environmental protection. These issues have figured prominently in international negotiations for many years and influence the implementation of the two United Nations framework conventions on the environment.   The causes of climate change and their impact on human life and the environment are well known. Regardless of the explanations proffered  environmental pollution is caused by human activity. Consequently  we hope that the negotiations on a post-Kyoto climate regime will conclude with the adoption  at the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held soon in Durban  of an international instrument that could be opened for signature at the Rio+20 Conference.   In Central Africa  the countries of the Congo Forest Basin  for their part  have made a commitment to sustainably manage their forests through conservation  forest certification  combating illegal logging  good forest governance  the gradual streamlining of the logging industry and implementation of the process to reduce emissions    11-51398 10  from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. This effort  which should be continued  has resulted in very low deforestation rates. This is one of Central Africa’s major contributions to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. The international community should support and encourage it.  On the initiative of the Republic of the Congo  the first summit on the world’s three tropical forest ecosystems was held in Brazzaville from 29 May to 3 June. That summit  which brought together the countries of the Amazon  South-East Asia and Congo Basins  resulted in the conclusion of a cooperation agreement on these three tropical forest ecosystems with the support of United Nations agencies and other partners. The agreement is to be signed in Rio de Janeiro on the sidelines of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  to be held in June 2012. In that regard  I wish to express the gratitude of the Congolese Government to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his personal support to this initiative.  As the Assembly is aware  the conservation and sustainable management of forests requires substantial human  material and financial resources  which forest developing countries do not have. Those countries are desperately awaiting the release of the “fast start” funds that developed counties announced at Copenhagen and the delivery of the innovative  predictable and permanent sources of funding agreed at Cancún  as well as technology transfer and capacity-building.   In mentioning these climate and environmental issues  I cannot but think of Mrs. Wangari Maathai  who passed away yesterday. I pay tribute to the memory of this first Nobel Prize-winning woman of African politics  who the world will remember as an avant-garde activist in the fight to protect the environment. Her commitment to reforestation and restoring biodiversity won her the recognition of the countries of Central Africa  who designated her as a Goodwill Ambassador for the Congo Basin Forest. I should like to take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya  as well as to the family of the deceased.   The events taking place in the Arab world are replete with lessons  as were the enormous changes that transformed the European landscape after the fall of the Berlin Wall  in 1989. Everywhere  the hymn of freedom and democracy has resounded. We know that the overthrow of a political regime does not necessarily bring freedom and democracy. They must be won and nurtured by other victories that cannot be imposed from without. The world has changed and we must face the facts inherent in these new geopolitical challenges  which have led to the emergence of new forces on the international stage. Freedom of expression thrives here  in the United Nations. Let democracy not stop on its threshold. The United Nations must be the sanctuary of those who are building the future. A safer  fairer and more prosperous world for all will then emerge. "
"38",1546,"COL",66,2011,"During the past year we have witnessed events and popular uprisings that are changing the face of the planet  both politically and economically. As President of a country that firmly believes in multilateralism  I come to the General Assembly today to emphasize how important it is for the United Nations to assume the fundamental role that belongs to it in the face of such crises. Crises in and of themselves are neither good nor bad; their results depend on how we manage them. They can often become genuine opportunities.   The political transformations we are seeing in North Africa and in the Middle East  for example  if they lead to a strengthening of democracy and the rule of law in the affected countries  can be a factor in global stability. What the peoples request  what the peoples seek  is freedom  respect for their rights  the ability to choose their leaders and democracy. The duty of the international community is to support them. If we do not  if we turn our back on them  we may see a protracted period of civil wars and conflict  which we should avoid at all cost.  Therefore  we must commit ourselves to strengthening and applying the methods of peaceful conflict resolution described in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter. The more efficient we are in the use of preventive diplomacy  the less need there will be for intervention.   We should advocate effective mediation with conviction  mediation that does not seek the leading role but one that is given the time and tools required to establish trust and to reach solutions that are advantageous to all parties.  I am pleased to be able to affirm today that Colombia does not just believe in mediation and peaceful solutions; we have successfully put them into practice. My Government succeeded in normalizing relations with two countries: Venezuela and Ecuador. We did this on the basis of conciliation and respectful  direct dialogue.  The former President of Argentina  Mr. Néstor Kirchner  then Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations  lent his good offices to the rapprochement between Venezuela and Colombia. His management was extremely effective  a great legacy he left to our region.  In Latin America we have learned that Governments and States may have differing  even at times opposing  political concepts  but that this does not mean they cannot live together and cooperate in peace. We have also made important contributions to the search for dialogue  negotiation and mediation in our region. Honduras is an example of that effort. Venezuela and Colombia joined forces to support the Honduran parties in their reconciliation through dialogue and rebuilding trust. This succeeded in bringing Honduras back into the Union of South American Nations.  What I have said so far can also be applied to long-standing conflicts  such as that between Israel and Palestine. Advances can be achieved if  and only if  direct dialogue and effective mediation are employed. Along with the rest of the international community  we are concerned by the suspension of peace negotiations  and we urge — in fact  we implore — both parties to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. That is the only — I repeat  the only — path that leads to what we all wish to see: two States living in peace and security.    11-50692 42   On a positive note  we can offer as an example of appropriate cooperation and negotiation the efforts that led to the creation of the Republic of South Sudan  the most recent Member of the United Nations  to which we give the most effusive welcome.  As a current member of the Security Council  Colombia has brought to the agenda the situation of Haiti  a country struck by natural phenomena and affected by unacceptable poverty. The solution there must remain a priority for all of us. Peace in Haiti will be the fruit not just of peacekeeping operations  but of the empowerment of Haitians themselves in handling their own problems and solutions  with sufficient international support for their economic and social development.  By virtue of its place as the country with the greatest biodiversity per square kilometre in the world  which makes it highly vulnerable  Colombia is committed to measures that mitigate the effects of climate change and enable us to adapt to them.  We are participating in the preparations for the upcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  Rio+20  which will take place in July 2012  with a proposal we have been developing in consultation with other countries. We believe that one of the main results of Rio+20 should be the establishment of a set of sustainable development goals based on the agenda that was approved in the first conference and echoing the Millennium Development Goals.  The guiding principles were established in Rio in 1992  and an implementation plan was agreed on in Johannesburg in 2002. Today  20 years later  we need to define a set of goals that allow us to measure achievements  identify shortcomings and determine the opportunities for advancement. The planet and its future demand that we work with goals  with specific indicators of results that ensure the efficacy of our efforts.  A year ago I said that thanks to advances in economic and social security  Colombia was at the threshold of a new dawn. Today I can state with realism and well-founded optimism that the first rays of that new dawn are beginning to warm us and light our way.  My Government is one of national unity  in which the main political parties have converged around the fundamental objectives of the nation. This unity has afforded us a significant measure of governability and has enabled us to have historic laws and reforms approved in our Congress that will help us to have a more prosperous and safer nation  one that is more equitable and more egalitarian.  Among the initiatives that have been approved  I wish to point to a law concerning victims and the return of land that guarantees that the State and society work to make reparations and to return stolen lands to hundreds of thousands of farmers affected by the violence of the past several decades. We are paying a moral debt to the victims. This is the first time in the history of the world that this is happening before the end of an internal armed conflict. We have decided that justice  truth and reparations must not have to wait.   It is worth pointing out that Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon joined us in Bogotá the day that law was passed. He emphasized the advance it represented and offered the assistance of the United Nations in ensuring its proper application.   Also thanks to the governability guaranteed by our new national unity  we were able to establish a more equitable distribution of resources originating from oil and mining to ensure that they reach our neediest population and regions.  In addition  at this time of global financial and economic volatility  we have introduced into our Constitution the element of fiscal sustainability  and have enacted a law to ensure that the State maintains discipline in its management of public finances. Such responsible initiatives have increased investor confidence  had a positive impact on our country’s risk rating and will lead to a more stable economic future in which we believe we will be able to focus on reducing unemployment and poverty  my Government’s two main priorities.  Colombia  to a degree unlike any other country in the world  has had to deal with the global drug problem. We have had much success  but a great many challenges remain. We know how terrorists benefit from drug-trafficking  and there can be no doubt that drugs and terrorism threaten democracies and the rule of law. Colombia will continue to combat these scourges  because for us they represent a national security problem. We are actively cooperating in the region  and will continue to do so  to combat transnational crime. We can only succeed if we   43 11-50692  cooperate and work together in this struggle  which affects every country equally.  A year ago  from this rostrum (see A/65/PV.15)  I said that we should call the decade that was then just beginning the decade of Latin America and the Caribbean. I reaffirm that prediction now. Our region is an area of political and economic stability that is firmly determined to move forward with social policy. We have both the capability and the willingness to provide the world with solutions in the areas of the environment  water  energy  food and labour. But our region cannot grow or progress in isolation. We want to advance hand in hand with the world  sharing the principles of respect and tolerance. We welcome progress in prosperity wherever it occurs in the world.  That is why I would like to conclude by calling on the nations of the world and on the Organization that brings us together here to continue to work together to make use of the peaceful means at our disposal  with a new goal: to turn the crises we are experiencing today into opportunities for a better tomorrow. The future  as has always been the case  depends on us. With determination and positive leadership  we can convert these storms into winds favourable to the whole of humankind."
"39",1586,"COM",66,2011,"It is a great honour and a privilege for me to address this Assembly for the first time since I took office as President of the Union of the Comoros  on 26 May.   Allow me at the outset to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss and his entire team on their remarkable work. Lastly  I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his commendable and unceasing efforts to ensure that our Organization can better meet its objectives in a world increasingly marked by all kinds of crises: political  economic  social and environmental.  The Assembly is convening in its sixty-sixth session at a time when all humankind is struggling through one of its most difficult times. Indeed  peace  the most precious common good in the world  has never been more threatened. It is under threat on all of our continents  in our regions  in our subregions and in every one of our countries. It is threatened by political crises  diseases and natural disasters. It is also threatened by poor living conditions  unemployment  insecurity and underdevelopment.  The hotspots that have emerged in various regions of the world and the recent uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East have claimed  and continue to claim  many victims. Our countries continue to be burdened by emerging diseases  but also and especially by non-communicable diseases. In fact  cancers  diabetes and  in particular  cardiovascular diseases have taken many lives in our countries and threaten their development.   The problem of education and the lack of basic infrastructure  energy and potable water also pose a threat to peace and security in many developing countries. Moreover  no country today is safe from natural disasters linked to climate change. This situation is all the more tragic in small island developing States such as mine.  I need not mention the toxic effects of the financial crisis  which continues to affect our countries and seriously compromises the future of the global economy. Therefore  I should like to issue an urgent appeal to the international community to enhance its role in seeking rapid resolutions of all of these crises.  Indeed  only by working together and effectively to fight disease will we be able to ensure that our populations are healthy and our human resources are more productive. By joining our efforts  we may also curb unemployment through education and job creation and succeed in re-launching the socio-economic development of our countries. In addition  eradicating corruption — which is increasingly rampant in our countries — will help us succeed in re-launching development  which is an essential factor of peace and stability. Moreover  by strengthening the culture of democracy and rule of law  our countries will evolve towards greater peace and stability  which are key conditions for sustainable development.   The President took the Chair.   We must further develop solidarity among the member countries of this concert of nations. That must be done to bring our world out of its vulnerable state. The efforts of the developing countries in increasingly difficult situations will not succeed without active solidarity. The quasi-collective mobilization effort seen today in Europe and generally in the West to stem the financial crisis is most commendable. However  it must be extended to other sectors and continents. Likewise  it is indeed appropriate to act swiftly and in unison to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  which have inspired so much hope in our countries.   In this world in crisis  the Union of the Comoros has for the second time experienced an exemplary  peaceful change at the top level of the State. However  its solid footing in democracy and good governance will become truly irreversible only when poverty  misery and vulnerability cease to exist. That is why we have taken measures to fight corruption and to better use our national resources and preserve and protect biodiversity. Indeed  as a small island developing State that is directly concerned  we attach very special attention to the question of climate change and the environment. We work every day to improve the standard of living of our fellow citizens. But we also need the support of the international community.  In addition  and despite its difficult situation  my country will never set aside its responsibility to act within the international community. We intend to offer our modest contribution to mankind’s quest for a better world. Thus we take an active part in building peace and security by participating in the Eastern Africa Standby Brigade  in accordance with the requests of    11-51191 28  the international community. While we are aware that our means are modest  we intend to play our role within the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  because promoting peace anywhere in the world  particularly in Africa  remains for us a major imperative.  Terrorism  piracy and other transborder organized crime  including the trafficking of drugs and light weapons  are direct threats today to human security and to the national security of many countries. My country is doing its best to combat those scourges. But the international community must also provide greater assistance towards prevention  both structurally and operationally. Early warning mechanisms  exchanges of information and experiences  mutual assistance in training  organization and capacity-building will enable States and regional organizations  particularly the African Union  to enhance their capacities.  Issues that have remained unresolved  sometimes for decades  are sources of conflicts likely to jeopardize the cause of peace and security. That is the case in the question of Madagascar. The political crisis affecting the brotherly people of Madagascar deserves the full attention of the international community. The current efforts of the transitional Government  under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community  call for multiform support from the international community so that that large island can finally regain peace and security for the well-being of its people.  The same is true with regard to the question of Palestine. The Comoros has always supported the struggle of the brotherly Palestinian people and supports the request of the Palestinian authorities to the international community for the recognition of a Palestinian State in its borders of June 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital. Indeed  for more than 30 years Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands has remained an unresolved issue. As for my country  it supports that recognition and appeals to all countries that love peace  freedom and justice to do the same.  The Union of the Comoros cannot have any other position on that question  since it is directly concerned by another equally sensitive question that affects not only its national unity  territorial integrity and history  and international law  but also peace in the Indian Ocean region. Here I refer to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte.   Allow me to emphasize that the inclusion of the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte on the agenda of several sessions of the General Assembly and in relevant resolutions of the Assembly  the African Union  the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has not yet provided a solution to this thorny question  which has placed us in opposition to France for decades.   As the Assembly is aware  the unilateral decision of France to make the Comorian island of Mayotte a département is for us and for the international community null and void and can in no way be considered a fait accompli. Furthermore  the visa regime imposed by the French authorities on Comorians of the three other islands has broken up many families by turning the sea channel that separates Mayotte from its sister island Anjouan into a huge cemetery  where rest the remains of thousands of my compatriots who only wished to gain access to a part of their territory.  However  we cannot simply continue to condemn without any follow-up  or maintain fixed positions that do not contribute to the settlement of the issue  while we continue daily to witness many losses due to the visa regime imposed by France.  Therefore  I wish to reiterate from this rostrum my country’s legitimate determination to continue to claim the reintegration of the Comorian island of Mayotte as part of its natural grouping. However  we hope to be able to conduct this struggle by means of the necessary negotiations with France — an economic partner of the Comoros — but also and above all through including our brothers and sisters in Mayotte  because there can be no realistic and lasting solution to the dispute without their involvement.  That is the new approach that I proposed as soon as I was inaugurated to settle the territorial conflict that has divided my country and France for just over 30 years. Indeed  I believe that any search for a solution to this thorny problem must include our Mahorais brothers and sisters  with whom we share ties knitted through history  blood  language  religion and culture. We believe that the large Comorian diaspora in France and the island of Réunion can join with its brothers and sisters of Mayotte and the other three Comorian islands in order finally to renew their natural bonds  carry out projects and live out their common destiny in harmony.   29 11-51191   In this light  and in our desire to see this problem — which has lasted too long — be finally settled favourably and peacefully  that we hope to promote the negotiations with France and our Mahorais brothers and sisters that we believe to be essential.   Speaking of territorial integrity  I would like to make particular mention of countries that occupy a special place in Comorians’ hearts. For the Kingdom of Morocco  a brother country whose legitimate positions on the Western Sahara my country has always supported  I hope that the dialogue being held under the auspices of the United Nations will quickly lead to a peaceful solution to the problem. To the People’s Republic of China  that great country and friend to the Comoros  we here reaffirm our unfailing support for it in its legitimate struggle for one China  developing in peace and prosperity.  I cannot speak of justice and equity without bringing up the need for internal reform of our Organization  particularly the Security Council. We believe that only better representation of every continent on the Council  including the essential African presence as a permanent member  can ensure better cohesion within the international community and thus do away with frustration and antagonism.  In conclusion  I would like to thank all the friendly countries and the regional and international organizations that continue to support us in multiple ways in our efforts to re-launch our country’s socio-economic development. In particular  I thank Qatar  which hosted the conference on assistance in investment and development in the Comoros  the commitments for which have begun to materialize  thanks to the untiring efforts of high-level Qatari authorities. I would also like to thank the American Administration for its kind efforts to make our stay in this great and beautiful country enjoyable."
"40",1625,"CPV",66,2011,"It is a great honour to participate in the General Assembly and a great privilege to greet Members on behalf of the people and the Government of Cape Verde.   I address the Assembly in the Cape Verdean language  the Creole of Cape Verde. I believe this is the first time Cape Verdean Creole is used in United Nations General Assembly. I do it to share with the Assembly this piece of authentic world heritage  born on the threshold of the fifteenth century. Linguistic experts consider it the oldest Creole of Euro-African origin and the oldest within the Atlantic context.   I use it also because language is culture  history and memory. All languages are expressions of thoughts  knowledge and practices. Languages are no doubt an expression of civilization. Therefore  speaking in the Creole of Cape Verde  in this most important Hall  at a meeting of heads of State and Government  is a reference to our conviction that the Creole identity is of anthropological value for all humanity. It is a way of highlighting our Cape Verdeanship: our soul and the way of being  the ethos and pathos of Cape Verde  which is the result of the intersection of various peoples of the world. The language is  in and of itself  a synthesis of the meeting of civilizations. By using it  I also pay vibrant tribute to Aristides Pereira  the first President of Cape Verde and a great African fighter for freedom and human dignity  who recently passed away.  The central theme of this Assembly session — the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means — is a crucial and imperative theme for the world. It reflects the identity  the way of being and lifestyle of Cape Verdeans. As subscribers to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  we believe that peace and human rights are the key factors in the construction of sovereignty  democratic rule of law and sustainable development. Therefore  mediators are required to position and approach matters within the universal matrix of peace and human rights as the highest priorities of all States Members of the United Nations.     11-51372 2   In addition  we consider it crucial to take an approach focused on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases worldwide  especially in the context of the challenges faced by developing countries.  Let me offer a few special words regarding the development of themes such as desertification  land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  scheduled for June 2012  which we strongly and actively support.   One of the most decisive actions taken by independent Cape Verde  soon after 1975  was reforestation  along with orographic correction and the mobilization of water. As a small island developing State at the crossroads of two large regions — the Sahel and Macaronesia — and suffering the effects of the most stringent climatic randomness of one region and the oceanic isolation of the other  Cape Verde is conscious of the importance of the green as well as the blue economy to the objective of sustainable development.   We need the United Nations to work out our part in preventing climate change and food and water shortages. We count on the United Nations and all countries of this great General Assembly to converge both bilaterally and multilaterally towards the green economy and sustainable development. Therefore  in Cape Verde there is an ongoing and ambitious programme for covering 50 per cent of national energy needs through renewable sources by 2020.  Despite remarkable and positive changes — some of which have been internationally recognized  such as our graduation to middle-income country status and being on the path towards full achievement of the Millennium Development Goals — I would still like to take this opportunity to better acquaint the General Assembly with my country.  Cape Verde  with its ten islands in the middle of the Atlantic  strategically positioned in the corridor and the cross-Atlantic flow  is not only a strong partner for global security  geostrategic interests and world trade  but is also an active and useful member of the international community in the fight against trafficking and related crime. The vast oceanic region of Cape Verde is an important space for security in the promotion of regional peace and prosperity and in the affirmation of an international coalition to fight illicit transnational crime.  Some may wonder  “What country is this?” Some think of it as the nation of Amilcar Cabral; others see it as the country of Cesaria Evora. Cape Verde is a land that was once an important entrepôt and trans-shipment base for the African slave trade  for both Europe and the Americas. Its oldest city — Ribeira Grande  or the Cidade Velha — was named a World Heritage by UNESCO in 2009.  Cape Verde is a State that encourages other States to remember  through memory  history and human rights  the international slave routes  just as we remember the Holocaust  another of the heights of human barbarism. In Cape Verde we can defy our lusophone partners in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and our African partners and the entire world to reaffirm our commitment against barbarism  dictatorship  colonialism and disrespect for human rights through the promotion of the candidacy of the Tarrafal concentration camp on the island of Santiago as a World Heritage site.  Those who know us know that we are a country concerned with development. We do not settle for being middle-income country. We need the partnership with the international community to fulfil our destiny.  In Cape Verde’s transformational agenda  we have identified five pillars of our country’s growth and poverty reduction strategy: promotion of effective governance  strengthening human development  confronting the structural and social challenges arising from competitiveness  and investment in infrastructure for improving social cohesion.  Cape Verde is developing a foreign policy that favours democracy  justice  peace  cooperation and sustainable development. We look at the planet as the home of all  respecting the sovereignty and will of the people while emphasizing the global convergence in the core of humankind. We are therefore concerned about hunger in the Horn of Africa. We are concerned that thousands of children die in Africa every day from hunger. I am concerned that that does not motivate a stronger international intervention  since the dictatorship of hunger is the worst of dictatorships.   We urge the United Nations to be more effective and to make a concerted effort to reverse the image of that human tragedy in East Africa. We must therefore   3 11-51372  eradicate the geopolitics of hunger. We all need to take the paradigm of zero hunger in the world.  We are also concerned about wars and tensions that thrive a little everywhere but are now more localized and of more intense in Africa  the Middle East and Asia — to the delight of the dealers in misery  those who invest in the war industry and in the suffering of millions of human beings  especially children  women and the elderly. We must reach a global consensus that security  peace and stability arise from the economic and social development of States and peoples. We must deconstruct war  conflict and tension between countries and peoples and ensure the commitment of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly towards that noble goal. We must reiterate that mediation is essential to settle disputes  whether in Africa or in the rest of the world.  The global economic crisis is acute. In large countries it shows signs of settling and in poor countries it is amplified. If the crisis is global  it requires global responses against recessionary policies  such as the protection of domestic markets  and the war against unfairly priced imports. It also requires global positions that converge towards social inclusion as a way to reduce the impact of the economic crisis.  We reiterate our firm position of respect for international laws  the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and the sovereignty of peoples and nations. We do not support double standards for similar cases  as if peoples and nations were not equal and deserving of the same treatment  as stated in the United Nations Charter.  Before concluding  I must emphasize our position in favour of expanding the reform model of global governance by the United Nations  allowing  among the many benefits  small States to have a greater voice in the decision-making process of the international system. Cape Verde unequivocally supports an increase in the number of permanent members of the Security Council  in the belief that the world is no longer as it was at the end of the Second World War  nor does it resemble that of the end of the Cold War."
"41",1671,"CRI",66,2011,"It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by warmly congratulating Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to the post in which he has carried out his duties with such effectiveness and honesty. His contributions to the Organization  the international community and the multilateral system over these first five years are well known. We know they will continue to be so in the years to come.  I would also like to congratulate the President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. His experience  ability and dedication are guarantees of fruitful work.  I extend my best wishes to both as they exercise their vital functions  and they will have Costa Rica’s full support for their efforts in favour of peace  security  democracy  disarmament  human rights  respect for the rule of law  sustainable development  mediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes.  I am also very pleased to welcome South Sudan as a new Member of the Organization. I believe that its people will enjoy a prosperous  peaceful and safe future. The emergence of this new State is a testament to what can be achieved  even in situations of endemic violence  through serious negotiations between the parties and international mediation.  The intense and invigorating  but still uncertain  currents of political and social change that have swept through North Africa and the Middle East this year are proof of the universal force of democracy as an aspiration  of free expression as an incentive  and of respect for human dignity as the most urgent demand.  Our admiration for the peoples of those countries is as great as our hope in their capacity to forge social and political systems in peace  systems that are tolerant  free and dynamic  in which people are respected and whereby a country can be open to its neighbours.   We also hope that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will soon come to an end  with two sovereign and democratic States living in peaceful coexistence.  From its deepest collective roots  Costa Rica fully identifies with the principles of democracy  peace and human rights. These are values that we share with the immense majority of Central Americans.  Disrespect for those values  together with social exclusion  the outrages of militarism and the deadly echo of the Cold War  plunged much of Central America into a series of intense conflicts for almost four decades. After tens of thousands of deaths  our region was able  through dialogue and mediation  to overcome the worst manifestations of political violence. In those overwhelming days  Costa Rica made a decisive contribution by shaping and realizing the Esquipulas Accords  which opened the door to reconciliation.  Since then  progress has been slow and erratic. Fifteen years ago  as part of that process  Central American countries signed the Framework Treaty on Democratic Security in Central America. But the time that has elapsed since then has not sufficed to secure the peace  liberty  democracy and development in the region that we promised our peoples.  Even worse  we are now victims of a new and terrible form of aggression. I am referring to the cold  disastrous and fierce onslaught of transnational organized crime. Such activities have generated insecurity  weakened institutions  corrupted officials  fostered addiction  cut short the lives of thousands of young people  destroyed families and turned humble single mothers into criminals. This scourge has eroded the basic fabric of our society and has jeopardized the very existence of the rule of law in some countries.  Today  I wish to repeat the comments I made on 22 June at the International Conference on Regional Security in Central America  held recently in Guatemala. Our region has fallen victim to a perverse geopolitical situation. As Costa Rica is located between the major production centres and the world’s largest consumer market for drugs  we have become a target in the dynamic of death that both create. We must bear the burden of exponentially increasing material  institutional and human costs. What are instances of mere collateral damage for some of the main actors in this conflict are  for the people of Central America  extreme challenges and a source of deep wounds.  That is where our greatest frustration lies. That is why we demand that the international community  in particular the largest consumers of drugs and producers    11-50871 36  of the weapons that create violence  fully assume its share of responsibility without further delay.  The International Conference on Regional Security in Central America  which was attended by the Presidents of all of the countries in the region  from Mexico to Colombia  was a hopeful turning point. There  we were able to coordinate our strategies. There  we agreed on the need for a comprehensive approach to violence that includes measures to strengthen institutions and the rule of law  as well as comprehensive initiatives to prevent and fight crime. In addition  we were able to catch the attention of  and obtain some promises from  the international community.  Nonetheless  it remains to be seen whether the strategies can be translated into effective actions  or whether we will have enough support from external resources to drive them forward. Those resources are not merely aid. They are a morally inescapable and  in practical terms  indispensable form of compensation that we need to make at least part of the investment necessary to establish peace  stability and security.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations has insisted  quite rightly  on the need to promote preventive diplomacy. I join in that call as President of Costa Rica and as a citizen of Central America. I insist  before the world  that we can wait no longer to act in order to avoid an even greater tragedy in our region. It is already late; to wait even longer will be tragic.  Preventive diplomacy demands political will. We are approaching another moment in which it will be put to the test. I refer to the upcoming United Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty  which Costa Rica has actively supported  along with other States. We need to have the Conference produce a robust  comprehensive and demanding instrument capable of effectively controlling the flow of the death machines that provoke all types of conflict.  Preventive diplomacy  in its deepest essence  also means fostering democracy and human rights and respecting the rule of law as the cornerstone of security and international coexistence. Costa Rica knows it well. Since we abolished the army in 1949  our only lines of defence have been the deep civic beliefs of our people  the strength of our institutions and the instruments provided by the multilateral system. The security of the 26 other disarmed democracies in the world also depends on those defences. We deserve to be heard and paid attention to.  A little less than a year ago  our faith in international law and the instruments and institutions that underpin it was put to the test. Last October  Nicaraguan troops and civilians invaded and occupied part of our national territory  in clear violation of our sovereignty  the border treaties and international law. After exhausting the possibilities of a suitable bilateral agreement  we appealed to various forums of the regional and international system. Our neighbour’s Government rejected several of them. Finally  thanks to urgent measures ordered by the International Court of Justice  the Nicaraguan forces had to leave our territory.   However  while we await the Court’s final ruling  Nicaragua  ignoring the Court’s orders  has continued specific provocations to and violations of the provisional measures. Furthermore  it has threatened other actions that could infringe on our territory. We hope that that does not occur. But  if it were to  we will vigorously reinstate our actions before the machinery of the international system.  All that we request of the Organization and the multilateral system in general is rapid and timely consideration of possible aggressions. The international community cannot make its preventive action conditional on actual armed violence between brothers. It should react not only in relation to the quantity and scale of the explosive blasts  but to the severity and persistence of the violations.  Otherwise  the message to the world would be disastrous. It would imply that the shortest route for mobilizing international diplomacy is that of blood. As a country and as a people  we emphatically reject that notion.  Based on our firm belief in the importance of the rule of law  human rights and humanitarian law  I informed the Assembly a year ago of our aspiration to become a member of the Human Rights Council. Today  I am grateful for the generous support that it gave us in achieving that goal. We will remain faithful to the promises made at the time and to the proposals that we called for during the review of the Council in Geneva and New York.  In particular  I urge Member States to support an initiative whose time has come: the United Nations   37 11-50871  declaration on human rights education and training  which Costa Rica supports together with a group of like-minded countries. After its unanimous adoption by the Council  it will soon be submitted to the General Assembly. We are confident that it will receive similar support.  When education  deterrence and other preventive mechanisms are unable to avert the worst assaults on human dignity  the international community faces other obligations. Among them is the protection of civilians  contained in the responsibility to protect. My country recognizes that concept as a principle and guide for action  whether preventive or reactive  on the basis of legitimate and well-founded decisions. We hope that such a concept  like human security  is very clearly defined within the Organization.  Moreover  the fight for human rights requires that perpetrators of crimes against humanity be held accountable and punished. Today  the International Criminal Court is the main multilateral mechanism for achieving that goal. I reiterate our support of its activities and urge all States Members of the United Nations to ratify the Treaty of Rome. I also urge that we should all  as Member States  be more active and resolute in our support for the greater effectiveness  relevance and significance of the United Nations; hence  the importance of its reform process.  Costa Rica has joined and will continue to join initiatives that push for the best possible changes. Among other things  we will continue to work constructively for the ongoing improvement of the working methods of the Security Council  through the Small Five group  and for a more representative composition of that organ  in accordance with the guidelines of Uniting for Consensus.  Costa Rica is a middle-income country. Thanks to its commitment to democracy  peace  good governance  the efficient use of international cooperation and its investments in health and education  Costa Rica has achieved high levels of human development. Together with other States with similar characteristics  we exemplify the success of international cooperation as a key factor in achieving such results. However  we still face serious challenges with regard to poverty  income distribution  regional differences and the consequences of the economic crisis and natural disasters  among others.  We have been responsible  effective and ethical partners. We have made progress in development  but have still not been able to consolidate it to the point of dispensing with international assistance. We still need that assistance to fully secure our achievements. We look forward to the support and understanding of donor countries and the institutions of the United Nations  in particular the United Nations Development Programme. Our relative success should not be penalized  but bolstered.  Costa Rica has focused on sustainable social and environmental development. We have taken significant steps to sustain our growth through clean energy and a low-carbon economic model. Our goal is to become one of the first carbon-neutral countries in the world  and we are working diligently to achieve it.  On that path  in which every local action has global links  we have confidence in the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference  to be held in Durban at the end of the year  and in the coming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  planned for next year in Rio de Janeiro. However  we are also concerned about the lack of progress made in earlier negotiations.  I conclude these words by reiterating our deep commitment to the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations. I am delighted that yesterday we celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the International Day of Peace  a Costa Rican initiative that was adopted by consensus by Member States. It gives me even greater pleasure that its theme this year is “Peace and democracy: Make your voice heard”.  As national and international leaders  we should always heed the voices of our peoples. We should listen to them  respect them and incorporate them in our initiatives. That is part of our democratic responsibility  the basis of good governance  the seed of meaningful change and the foundation of legitimacy.  As President of Costa Rica  a discrete  noble  fraternal and free people  I promise not to relent in our efforts to achieve a better country and a better world."
"42",1740,"CUB",66,2011,"I am pleased to welcome the Government of South Sudan as a State Member of the United Nations. I also join the appeal by all African leaders for an urgent  effective and international response to the famine in the Horn of Africa.  While we are engaged in debate here  in Libya another preventive war is taking place under the pretext of protecting civilians. The United States and NATO  supposedly to avoid a massacre  launched a military attack against a sovereign State without there being any threat whatsoever to international peace and security. They unleashed a regime change operation. NATO imposed on the Security Council a dubious resolution authorizing   “Member States … acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements … to take all necessary measures … to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack” (resolution 1973 (2011)  para. 4).  Afterwards  NATO violated this same resolution in order to supply weapons  provide financing to one party and deploy operatives and diplomatic personnel on the ground. Now everybody has a better understanding of what the concept of responsibility to protect means and how it can be used. In this war  in addition to the most advanced and lethal military technologies  the means of communication have been used as weapons of war by financial and media businesses  which are profiteering from the war and the reconstruction operations  as if they were agents of crisis containment.  As early as 21 February  Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz warned that NATO was irrevocably preparing a war against Libya. Since then  Cuba has engaged indefatigably in the defence not of a Government but of a principle. It is unacceptable to assassinate thousands of innocent people under the dubious purpose of protecting other civilians. History has eloquently demonstrated that peace cannot be imposed either by war or by force. It is up to the Libyan people alone to choose their destiny  without foreign intervention  in the exercise of their right to self-determination  independence and sovereignty over their natural resources and their country’s territorial integrity.  The military intervention in Libya and the growing threat against Syria have been the opportunistic  defensive responses of the United States and Europe to the collapse of their system of domination and plunder in North Africa and the Middle East and to the emergence of genuinely popular movements in Tunisia  Egypt and other countries  in order to secure huge reserves of oil and water and to confiscate financial assets in times of global economic and social crisis. It is the responsibility of the General Assembly to exercise its full powers to prevent a military aggression against Syria. The public should be have objective information and speak up against war.  President Barack Obama  in his threatening  deceitful  rhetorical speeches of 20 and 21 September  described what happened in Libya as a new model. He said    “This is how the international community should work in the twenty-first century. More nations are assuming the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. In fact  this is the very purpose of the United Nations. So every nation represented here today can take pride in the innocent lives we saved and in helping Libyans reclaim their country. It was the right thing to do.”   A top White House official wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine that the new United States strategy is more efficient and less costly. The Bush Administration strategy considered occupation; the Obama Administration strategy is that of national liberation. The military intervention strategy in Libya could also be applied in other cases.  With absolute cynicism  what is proposed is a military aggression without casualties or the use of infantry troops  the costs of which would be mainly borne by Europe. The destabilization of a country    11-51390 14  through subversion  covert operations and economic sanctions is described  according to this doctrine  as the development of a national movement. That new regime-change operations model shows that current United States and NATO military doctrines are even more aggressive than their previous ones  and that the so called Euro-Atlantic periphery comprises the entire planet.  No one should doubt that Latin America and the Caribbean are included in that concept. The redeployment of the Fourth Fleet  the installation of American bases  troops and military means to intervene anywhere in the region  the coup d’état against Venezuela in 2002  followed by an oil coup  the sedition in Santa Cruz  Bolivia  the military coup in Honduras and the attempted coup in Ecuador all fit perfectly in the new strategy.  Can the United States and NATO guarantee today that the use of force and this concept of regime change do not apply in the case of Latin American and Caribbean countries that do not submit to their interests? Can the European Union say something about it? What would the United Nations do in such a situation?  The weakness of the global economy  particularly the economies of the United States and Europe  continues to show that the economic crisis that began in the year 2008 has not yet been overcome. In developed countries  the terrible burden of its consequences is borne by workers  the unemployed  immigrants and the poor  who are brutally repressed whenever they peacefully defend their rights.  We  the countries of the South  repeatedly plundered  suffer the distortions of a world economic order that excludes our legitimate interests. We suffer under the onerous impact of protectionism and the steady increase in the prices of foodstuffs and hydrocarbons. The peoples of many developing countries are victims of the bankrupt neoliberal economic model and its sequel of plunder and exclusion. The social and political consequences are being felt on all continents.  In the face of a global economic crisis and the depletion of the planet’s natural resources  what will be the response of the extremist right-wing forces that are already in power or may come to power as a result of the afflictions and hopelessness of voters? In the face of a growing and universal danger of war  of a new division of the world and of climate change  could we  the countries of the South  act together as an essential condition of our salvation?   In the face of so many serious threats  Latin America and the Caribbean — the region of Bolívar and Martí — is coming together  determined to finish what they left unfinished. It is impossible to divide us or to turn us against each other. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America is a small but morally powerful group of peoples  and the new Community of Latin American and Caribbean States is a fact. The full strength of the Andes will very soon be expressed in a summit  which will be an epoch-making event in Caracas — the epicentre of independence in the Americas  where a Bolivarian people has conquered power and a continental leader  President Hugo Chávez Frías  is ever growing.  More than ever  we have to defend the United Nations  but the biggest challenge will be to turn it into an organization that serves the legitimate interests of all States  instead of catering to the arbitrary wishes and abuses of a few rich and powerful countries. We must see to it that international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter prevail in the face of the brute force that aims to block them. It is necessary to re-establish the leading role of the General Assembly and to recast the Security Council.   The General Assembly has the inescapable moral  political and legal obligation to ensure the recognition of an independent Palestinian State  with the boundaries established before 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital  as a full Member of the United Nations. This should be accomplished with or without the Security Council  with or without the veto of the United States and with or without new peace negotiations.  If the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to independence  sovereignty and self-determination is recognized; if the need to re-establish the exercise of the human rights of Palestinians is recognized; if the blockade of Gaza  the economic coercion and segregation symbolized by the infamous wall are recognized as crimes; if the subjugation of a nation to conditions jeopardizing its very existence is described as genocide; if all Member States are supposed to adopt all legal measures within their reach to protect Palestinian civilians  then the General Assembly should take action now.   15 11-51390   Cuba  a country with a small Jewish community  condemns the historical injustice of anti-Semitism  the crime against humanity that was the Holocaust  and recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist. Our people harbour only fraternal feelings towards the Israeli people  who are also victims of this conflict.  Cuba likewise proclaims that the United States has the moral  political and legal obligation to stop its continual veto of Security Council resolutions intended to protect the Palestinian civilians.  The European Union should oppose this veto and abstain from supporting the empire’s brutal pressure on members of this Assembly and the Council itself. Europe should denounce it also because it is certain that those crimes would not be occurring without the military supplies  financial support and impunity that the United States provides to the Government of Israel.  On 11 September 2001  we Cubans shared the pain of the American people at those atrocious terrorist acts. We offered selfless solidarity  encouragement and cooperation. As always  Cuba made crystal-clear statements against terrorism and against war.  Ten years later  the world is even more insecure  because instead of turning international consensus against terrorism into a system of international cooperation to confront it  the United States invaded and occupied Iraq and Afghanistan  causing the loss of life of hundreds of thousands of persons and pain to tens of millions. It was not possible to hide the use of deception  torture  extrajudicial executions or assassinations  disappearances of individuals  arbitrary detentions and the secret renditions and prisons of the Central Intelligence Agency in Europe and other regions.  The Government of the United States desecrates the memory of the victims of 11 September when it continues the prolonged inhumane imprisonment of the five Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who were unjustly condemned  in spurious trials  to sentences of maximum severity for seeking information about the terrorist activities of groups that have operated with absolute impunity from United States territory against Cuba  leading to the death of or physical harm to 5 577 of our citizens. Once again  with all due respect  I urge President Obama to make use of his powers to release them as an act of justice or as a humanitarian gesture  which would be highly appreciated by their children  wives  mothers  fathers and all of our people.  The Cuban Government reiterates its interest and willingness to move towards the normalization of relations with the United States. Today I reiterate the proposal to begin a dialogue aimed at solving bilateral problems  including humanitarian issues  as well as our offer to negotiate several cooperation agreements concerning drug-trafficking  terrorism  human smuggling  natural disasters and protection of the environment  including in the event of oil spills such as the one that occurred at the British Petroleum platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  However  we know that the electoral race has already begun in this country  while the economic situation is growing worse.  The economic  commercial and financial blockade of Cuba has been tightened. The damages it has caused have totalled $975 billion  based on the current price of gold. The attempt to subvert the constitutional order that Cubans have freely elected is intensifying. There is increasing pressure from the extreme right and the Cuban-American mafia to reverse the minimal steps adopted by the American Government to promote  to some degree  links between Cuban émigrés and their home country and exchanges between both peoples.  In Cuba  President Raúl Castro Ruz has reiterated that we will continue  in our own sovereign way  to change everything that needs to be changed in order to make our economy more efficient and our socialism better  to achieve full justice and to be able to fully preserve our independence.  As Martí said  “The southern sea will join the sea of the north and a serpent will hatch from the egg of an eagle before we cease our struggle to make the homeland free and prosperous.”"
"43",1786,"CYP",66,2011,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I express the support of the Cypriot delegation  and I wish you every success in fulfilling your duties.  Over the past six months we have witnessed historic changes in the wider region of the Middle East and North Africa  a region which is very close to Cyprus. A popular movement has developed in this region with the aim of implementing fundamental democratic reforms. The reforms are a sovereign affair for the peoples. We hope that they are achieved peacefully  without bloodshed and for the benefit of the peoples themselves  through political dialogue and with the support of the international community. We  the international community  should offer this support while respecting the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Member States of the United Nations.  The Republic of Cyprus has experienced violence  and we still suffer from its consequences. Cyprus is still suffering the effects of the illegal Turkish invasion of 1974 and the ongoing occupation. The Cyprus problem is first and foremost a problem of invasion and occupation and the violation of international law and of the human rights of Cypriot citizens.  Since the Turkish invasion in 1974  our goal has been a peaceful resolution of the problem through negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General and on the basis of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Cyprus.  Since September 2008  we have undertaken a renewed effort to solve the Cyprus problem  under the auspices of the United Nations  through direct negotiations between the leaders of the two communities  upon our initiative. This effort is focused on the evolution of the unitary State into a federal one  with two federated units with political equality as defined in relevant Security Council resolutions — one State  with a single sovereignty  a single citizenship and a single international personality. This basis was reaffirmed by the leaders of the two communities in 2008  when they agreed on the resumption of negotiations.    11-50865 2   At the same time  the negotiating process  under the auspices of the United Nations  was agreed. The negotiations are Cypriot-led and Cypriot-owned  as was agreed with the Secretary-General  excluding any form of arbitration or artificial time frames. This was agreed  bearing in mind recent negative experiences that resulted from unsuccessful attempts to solve the problem.  We aim to achieve a mutually agreed solution  terminating the occupation and the illegal colonization by Turkey with settlers in the occupied part of Cyprus. We seek a solution that reunifies the country and its people and creates conditions of lasting peace and security on the island.  An important aspect of the Cyprus problem  of a humanitarian nature  is the issue of missing persons. This issue must be settled regardless of the developments in the negotiations. Turkey must fulfil its obligations  which stem from the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights  to allow exhumations in military areas and open the archives of its army and of other services  in order to determine the fate of the missing persons.  During the first two years of direct negotiations between the leaders of the two communities  convergences have been reached on various aspects of the Cyprus problem. I regret to note that  lately in particular  the Turkish Cypriot side is backtracking  even from convergences that had been found. This change in the stance of the Turkish Cypriot leadership draws on the recent negative and provocative policy of Turkey in the region.  In recent years  the Republic of Cyprus has started a process for the exploration and potential extraction of hydrocarbons within its exclusive economic zone. This was preceded by agreements to delimit the exclusive economic zone with neighbouring countries  always within the framework of international law  in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which the Republic of Cyprus has ratified. We anticipate that this effort will contribute to the discovery of new energy resources  particularly for Europe  and of course for the shared benefit of our people  Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike.  We believe that the possible discovery and extraction of hydrocarbons will constitute yet another strong motive for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to expedite a just  functional and viable solution to the Cyprus problem  so that both communities can enjoy the natural wealth of our country in conditions of peace  security and prosperity. I wish to reassure our Turkish Cypriot compatriots that  regardless of the circumstances  they would benefit from the possible discovery and extraction of hydrocarbons.  Unfortunately  the effort of the Republic of Cyprus to exercise its sovereign right to exploit its marine wealth is met by threats by Turkey against Cyprus. Turkish naval manoeuvres in the region of Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone  where explorations are being carried out  are provocative and constitute a real danger of further complications in the region. At the same time  Turkey has continued its illegal actions by concluding an agreement with the illegal regime in the occupied area of the Republic of Cyprus in order to pursue exploration within the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus.  From this rostrum  I wish to condemn that illegal act  which constitutes a provocation not only for the Republic of Cyprus but for the entire international community. Instead of adopting a constructive stance in the negotiations for a speedy solution to the Cyprus problem  Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership are trying to create tension and new  illegal faits accomplis. Ankara’s latest threats directed at a European Union (EU) member State come at a time when Turkey is seeking to open new chapters in its EU accession negotiations.  We wish to express our gratitude to the permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council  and to the European Union  for the clear position they have taken in defending the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We call on the Security Council  the Secretariat and the United Nations in general to impress upon the Turkish leadership that any threat to or violation of the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus  or any continuing violation of international and European law  will not be tolerated.  We are fully committed to continuing to work towards a solution of the Cyprus problem  within the agreed framework and on the basis of the agreed process  as soon as possible. Considering that it is first and foremost the Cypriot people who are suffering from the continuing occupation  it is only natural for us to demonstrate goodwill and exert all our efforts to reach a just  viable and functional solution to the   3 11-50865  Cyprus problem and for the reunification of the State and our people.  We will continue to work to strengthen cooperation and trust between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. A rapprochement of the two communities is integral to our policy. We are continuing with our initiatives aimed at creating the conditions conducive to a solution. We recall our proposal for the restitution of Famagusta — a European city  uninhabited since 1974 as a result of the Turkish occupation — to its lawful inhabitants  under United Nations administration. Our proposal also includes the use of the city’s port by Turkish Cypriots under EU supervision.   The implementation of this proposal will significantly boost negotiations and increase trust between the two communities; that will also lead to the unfreezing of negotiations chapters in Turkey’s EU accession process. We recall that the handover of the uninhabited area of Famagusta to United Nations administration  and the return of its lawful inhabitants  is called for in Security Council resolution 550 (1984)  which Turkey refuses to implement.  We would like to express our gratitude to the United Nations  under whose auspices the talks between the leaders of the two communities are being carried out. We thank the Security Council and the Secretary-General himself for his good offices.   It is to the Secretary-General’s credit that during his recent meetings with the leaders of the two communities he persistently sought reaffirmation of the basis for the negotiations from both sides. He has referred specifically to Security Council resolution 1251 (1999)  which provides that the solution to the Cyprus problem shall be a bi-zonal  bi-communal federation with political equality  as defined in the Security Council resolutions: a State with a single sovereignty  a single citizenship and a single international personality  excluding any form of union  in whole or in part  with any other country as well as any form of partition or secession. That is the basis that the United Nations continues to support.  We are also grateful that the Secretary-General has asked for the reaffirmation of the convergences that were previously agreed on in the framework of the talks. As I have mentioned  the Turkish Cypriot leader has unfortunately retreated from previous agreements of fundamental importance. We believe that the only way to move forward and reach a solution as soon as possible is by upholding the commitments that both sides have undertaken in the presence of the Secretary-General. Negotiations should be carried out on a clear basis and without backtracking.  The long-standing dispute in the Middle East is now characterized by frozen negotiations. It is vitally important that the peace process be resumed on the basis of the principles established by the international community in its resolutions. Cyprus supports the resumption of negotiations and calls on both sides to engage with honesty and goodwill  without creating new faits accomplis.   Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve a peaceful  stable and secure future within a framework of two independent States. We maintain our principled position for a free and independent Palestinian State  next to the State of Israel  within the 1967 borders.   It has been 10 years since the attacks on the World Trade Center here in New York. Cyprus continues to support the collective efforts of the international community  based on international law  to eliminate international terrorism. We support the implementation of the necessary measures  including the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Most countries in the world are still in the grip of the global financial crisis. This crisis proves that a new model of growth must prevail  focused on reducing social inequalities  eradicating poverty and safeguarding the rights of workers and all other people. Special emphasis must be given to the fairer distribution of social goods  such as health and education  and to ending the market’s impunity and lack of regulation. Emphasis must also be given to dealing with social repercussions  such as unemployment  delinquency  crime and social marginalization — problems that cause social tensions and conflicts in a number of countries in Europe and the world.  There can be no doubt that building prosperity and global stability on solid foundations cannot be accomplished without protecting the environment and our planet and promoting the sustainable use of its resources.   In conclusion  I wish to stress that there is no way to deal with the challenges facing humankind today    11-50865 4  other than collective action. We will succeed only if we realize that our future must be characterized by mutual respect  the fairer distribution and redistribution of global wealth  social progress and equality  and the prevalence of international law and human rights."
"44",1810,"CZE",66,2011,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the very important post of the highest representative of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  A few days ago New York City and the entire world remembered the tenth anniversary of the tragic events of 11 September. I should like to use this opportunity to pay homage to all the victims and to the firefighters and other rescue workers who died in connection with the 2001 attacks. We should not forget them.  The main topic suggested for the sixty-sixth session — the mediation of disputes by peaceful means — is at the very core of the United Nations Charter  and I can assure members it is also at the core of the foreign policy principles of the country I have the privilege to represent  the Czech Republic. Nineteen years ago the dissolution of Czechoslovakia was negotiated peacefully from within  without any need for external mediation. Our experience tells us that if a solution to any country’s aspirations to sovereignty and freedom  or a solution to a dispute among countries  is to be lasting and acceptable for the citizens of those countries  that solution must primarily come from within the region itself and from the negotiations of the countries concerned. In the same spirit  the Czech Republic is convinced  with regard to the most important issue of this session of the General Assembly  that it is necessary for the two sides in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute to find a way forward themselves.   I agree with President Obama that there is no shortcut to ending a conflict that has endured for decades. It requires that both sides take an innovative approach and overcome some old  inflexible and rigid schemes of thought. It requires both sides to negotiate and to find a balanced solution that will last. Such a solution cannot come through unilateral steps  neither those forced by the United Nations nor the steps taken by one side of the dispute only.   The Czech Republic successfully completed the transition from communism to democracy  and  based on that experience  we wish the countries of North Africa to make progress in the same direction. We know it is not an easy path. To remove several leading politicians is not the crucial aspect of the much-needed systemic change.   When the Iron Curtain fell in Europe more than 20 years ago  I used to talk about three mutually interconnected preconditions for successful transformation: a clear and transparent concept of where to go  a feasible strategy how to get there  and to be able to motivate the citizens of the country to    11-51185 8  promote it. I still do not see these preconditions in some of the countries of North Africa.   By saying that  I want to stress that the systemic change cannot be agreed upon or prearranged at international conferences. It cannot be mediated or passively acquired as a foreign investment. It is a domestic task and a sequence of policies  not a once-for-all policy change.   There is something we can do  however. We can and should increase our efforts to cooperate with the countries of North Africa. We should not forget that there is a complementarity between freedom and trade. Our relations — and now I speak especially about us  the European Union member States — with the countries of North Africa should be based on free trade  which means on trade with a minimum of regulation and arbitrary standards. Prosperity in the countries of North Africa is a guarantee of stability and is also a precondition for preventing growing migration to the countries in Southern and Western Europe.  I should also like to mention another issue that I see as crucial  that of nuclear energy. I welcome the fact that the Secretary-General called for a special meeting on this topic. The Czech Republic pays the highest possible attention to nuclear safety and security and supports the further development of nuclear energy.   What happened in Japan in March this year was a serious natural catastrophe  and there are certainly lessons to be learned from it. The main lesson is obvious. Even coastal locations  which are seen as seismically stable for urban planning  can be affected by earthquakes far away under the sea. Nuclear power plants should be built in locations that are the least prone to damage by natural disasters. Yet after the tsunami hit the Fukushima power plant  some Governments decided not to build new nuclear power plants and some even to abandon nuclear energy as such.   Speaking for the Czech Republic  we consider that what happened in Fukushima did not by any means question the arguments for nuclear energy. These arguments are strong  economically rational and convincing. Nuclear power is a stable  legitimate and  in some countries  irreplaceable source of energy today.  Let me conclude by saying that the Czech Republic continues to support the much-needed reform of the Security Council. The world has changed considerably since the United Nations Charter was signed. New countries must take greater responsibility for this Organization and for its financing.   This year the Czech Republic holds the presidency of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme  which supports projects in 177 countries. We support that Programme but want to stress that in order for developing countries to develop  all kinds of unnecessary barriers  standards  regulations and other constraints in the developed world must first be removed.   I wish the President every success in his office and assure him that the Czech Republic will continue to be an active Member of the United Nations."
"45",1872,"DEU",66,2011,"Seldom has people’s yearning for freedom  dignity and self-determination played such a dominant role as it has this year. Until now  we have experienced globalization   49 11-51384  first and foremost through the ever-greater integration of the world economy. Today  we see that globalization means so much more; that it has also brought about a globalization of values. Those are the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter  the inalienable rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In North Africa and in the Arab world  millions of people have shaken off the shackles of decades of oppression. They want freedom  democracy and human rights  as well as better lives for themselves and their families. That road is anything but easy. A new political system must mature in order to become stable. That takes time and patience. However  even the longest road begins with the very first step. This is a year of momentous steps.  We have not forgotten the moving images of people who won dignity and self-respect by their own efforts  the proud faces on Bourguiba Boulevard in Tunis and in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Those people want to shape their own future  and their yearning is by no means limited to the Arab world. In Belarus  too  people long for an end to repression and tyranny and for the opportunity to fully develop their individual personalities.  With the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification more than 20 years ago  Germany experienced for itself the joy of a peaceful revolution. Today we have a fundamental interest in the success of the political awakening in the southern Mediterranean region. We Germans offer our support for the reforms in Morocco and Jordan  the political awakening in Egypt and Tunisia  and the fresh start in Libya following the overthrow of the dictator.  Every country and every society will find its own way into the modern world  either through revolution or through reform. We want to provide advice and support. We want to help create an independent judiciary  a pluralistic media landscape  and a vibrant civil society. We want to help people come to terms with their past and we want to support the constitutional process. Above all  however  we want to assist in the crucial process of building a new social and economic order  for we all know that the success of social change largely hinges on economic success. People who take to the streets for freedom and self-determination must see first-hand that they  too  can succeed with the help of their ideas  their creativity and their commitment.  Germany is therefore working not only for close partnerships but for increased market access. We want to foster change through increased trade. We are offering investments  especially in the small and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of an open and successful society. Most important of all  however  will be to offer young people education and training so that they can make the most of their opportunities. That is of key importance to successful transitions and fresh starts in those countries.  The courageous men and women of Syria deserve a clear sign of our solidarity. The Syrian Government has responded to the legitimate demands of the Syrian people with brutal force. Germany will continue to press for a Security Council resolution. This is not only about showing solidarity with the Syrian people; it is also about the credibility of the international community. If the repression continues  we Europeans will further tighten sanctions against the regime. The Syrian people should be free to shape their own future.  This week has been dominated by the unresolved conflict in the Middle East. On Friday here in New York  President Abbas expressed the Palestinians’ expectations and understandable frustration with the lack of progress made (see ). On the same day  Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s justified desire to exist in peace within secure borders (see ). Both sides have legitimate interests. However  these interests are certainly not irreconcilable. They can be overcome if the parties involved are willing to do so.  Germany is backing a two-State solution. We support a Palestinian State that will allow the Palestinians to live in dignity and self-determination and that is independent  sovereign  contiguous and democratic  as well as politically and economically viable. Over the past few years  we have been heavily involved in the practical development of this statehood by helping to build an administration  infrastructure and vocational training  as well as politically  in the German-Palestinian Steering Committee. And we do not want that State to be founded sometime in the distant and indeterminate future.  Let there be no doubt  however  that the security of Israel is and will continue to be part of the raison d’être of the Federal Republic of Germany. Peace    11-51384 50  between Israelis and Palestinians is possible. A Palestinian State is possible. Two States existing peacefully side by side are possible. However  they can be achieved only through negotiations. The statement issued by the Middle East Quartet on Friday identified the milestones along the way. Germany worked hard for that Quartet statement and staunchly supports it.  The confrontation of words here in New York must not be allowed to lead to an escalation in violence in the Middle East. I therefore call on both sides  Palestinians and Israelis  to enter into direct negotiations without delay. On Friday  the two sides reaffirmed their desire for a negotiated peace. The task now is to channel the energy and pressure of recent days into a constructive process. The two sides have been called on to come forward within three months with comprehensive proposals on territory and security  and to refrain from all provocative actions. The international community will continue to support the difficult road to peace. This includes the Moscow conference as part of the negotiating timetable for the coming months.  I would like to express my appreciation to all who have worked so hard in the past few days to create this opportunity for a constructive solution. As a European  I would like to extend my special thanks to the European Union’s High Representative  Lady Ashton. Let us make use of the impetus provided by the intensive efforts here in New York for the benefit of the people of Israel and the Palestinian territories.  The international community has worked tirelessly for years to ensure that Afghanistan ceases to harbour a threat to international peace and security. Many  indeed too many people have already lost their lives as a result of that threat. On 5 December in Bonn  under Afghanistan’s chairmanship  we will discuss the way forward. The Conference will focus on three major issues. The first is the complete handover of responsibility for security. This summer saw the start of a process whereby the Afghans are to gradually assume responsibility for security in their country by 2014. This is a responsible handover of responsibility.  Secondly  the international community will remain engaged in Afghanistan after 2014. Afghanistan will continue to need economic initiatives and more regional cooperation to help strengthen its sovereignty. The New Silk Road initiative  which we launched here in New York last week  is intended to serve this aim.   Thirdly  Afghanistan’s internal reconciliation and support from States in the region are critical to lasting peace. The brutal murder of former President Rabbani shows that the reconciliation process will continue to suffer setbacks. Nevertheless  it must and will go on. Germany will play its part on the road to Bonn.  While people are seizing the opportunity to build a better future for themselves in freedom and self-determination in a growing number of countries around the world  millions in the Horn of Africa are struggling to survive. The United Nations has played a valuable role in providing swift humanitarian assistance. Germany is doing everything in its power in this and many other crises to alleviate the suffering.  The collapse of State authority and the impact of climate change are aggravating the already disastrous situation. Germany will continue to be in the vanguard of the fight against climate change. As with disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation  as well as the protection of human rights  the fight against climate change is an integral element of preventive diplomacy. It is part of a farsighted peace policy.  By the end of this year  our planet will have more than 7 billion inhabitants. In that world  Germany will place its hopes in a strong United Nations as a forum for political consensus-building  a source of rules with international legitimacy  and a player in the crisis regions of this world. The United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights offer more people than ever before the direction and inspiration they need to strive for a cooperative world order and a fairer global community.  However  the United Nations has to adapt to our changing world. Only then will the decisions made here gain political force  effectiveness and acceptance. New centres of power are emerging in global politics. Their economic dynamism has prompted them to demand political participation. The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly considered United Nations reform  but no real progress has been achieved so far. We welcome the fact that the new President intends to again personally champion this reform. We will do everything we can to him.  In September 38 years ago  two German States were admitted to the United Nations. At that time  my predecessor in office  Walter Scheel  stated before the Assembly:   51 11-51384   “Where there is a question of international cooperation  of preserving peace and of protecting the rights of man  there the Federal Republic of Germany will always be found. If there is anything we have learned from our own bitter experience it is this: man is the measure of all things”.  Man is the measure of all things. Germany remains committed to this principle."
"46",1904,"DJI",66,2011,"Allow me to warmly congratulate the President on his accession to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. With his experience and expertise we are indeed assured of the successful conduct and outcome of our deliberations. I express my gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his efficiency and the excellent manner in which he guided our work throughout the sixty-fifth session. We wish him well in his future endeavours.   I also extend my warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. That is a token of the esteem that all States have for his outstanding leadership  especially in these turbulent times and the difficult international political situation. We appreciate his tireless efforts and commitment to serve the international community  and we pledge our full support in carrying out and promoting the fundamental values of the Charter.   Lastly  we are delighted at the long-awaited creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  which   17 11-51185  announces the remarkable progress that has been made during the past century in the quest for gender equality and empowerment of women. Clearly  despite the great strides made in legal matters  it is still true that such progress is not always translated into reality. My Government has made strengthening women’s rights and improving their lives absolute priorities  and I am committed to ensuring that our laws conform to international standards.  We are gathered here today in a global economic context that is more than worrying. This difficult world economic environment is indeed reflected in weak economies  declining growth  crippling debts and deficits and rising unemployment. The least developed countries are more severely affected by these crises. The Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held recently in Turkey  gave new impetus to global efforts to improve the fate of the most vulnerable nations. From this perspective I invite the international community to pay special attention to the unique situation of least developed countries and to provide more support in alleviating the growing burden of debt by assisting them to improve their production capacity and facilitating access to world markets on more favourable terms.   Coupled with the economic malaise  we are witnessing throughout the world increasing climatic disparities that range from one extreme to another. It is now very common for countries to be hit by floods followed by droughts  and by earthquakes  devastating hurricanes or tsunamis. The catastrophe that recently hit our Japanese friends testifies to nature’s ferocity. The recurrence of these climate plagues shows us that we must better prepare ourselves and set up appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures.  In the Horn of Africa the uncertainties of the climate have long been a fact of life  as evidenced by the recurrent cycles of drought. The current crisis affecting my country is not sudden. We had already sounded the alarm in 2010  when the first warning signs appeared. Faced with this terrible scourge  the resilience of the region is strained  and emergency measures alone cannot meet the challenges now confronting us. Indeed  the situation we face today is the result of several years of drought that have decimated the herds of nomadic peoples and destroyed their meagre crops. People in rural areas are obviously the most affected  and we are doing our best to help them.   Our needs are immediate and urgent  and we are grateful to the friendly countries and international organizations that have assisted us in our efforts. However  given the endemic nature of the drought in our region  we need to go beyond reactive management and focus more on managing long-term preventative measures. In this context my country has established several infrastructure projects in agriculture  including the exploitation of arable lands in the neighbouring friendly countries of Ethiopia and the Sudan  and the River Awash water catchment project on the border with Ethiopia for times of floods.   The country most affected by this crisis remains Somalia  because the precarious security situation does not allow access to certain populations. Indeed  over the past two decades  Somalia has been a victim of the worst evils. It has been the victim of endless bloodshed  insecurity  instability and destruction. Until recently Al-Shabaab militia continued fighting in the capital  which made it all the more difficult to help the affected population. Today  thanks to the diligence and sacrifices of the Somali security forces and their colleagues from the African Union Mission in Somalia  Al-Shabaab militia have been pushed out of the capital  and that has facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid to drought victims.  As I was able to see for myself during my visit to Mogadishu last month  the guns have fallen silent  life has resumed its course and this year  for the first time since the armed conflict began in 1991  Somalis were able to celebrate Eid in peace. Numerous high-level officials have since visited the Somali capital  which had long been considered too dangerous.   This still-fragile but auspicious peace is an opportunity for the Somali people to rebuild their country. Thanks to the security situation  which is now under control in the capital  the Somali people and their leaders have before them an unprecedented opportunity to revive a lasting peace  to stop the interminable transition process and to move the country to a permanent governance by next year. Efforts have been made in this direction by the Transitional Government as well as by regional and international organizations. These have helped parties to reach an agreement that reflects the new political reality in Somalia  especially after the month of August 2011.     11-51185 18   All these efforts should be applauded as a sign of the determination of the Somalis and of the international community to end the endless infighting and fruitless discussions within the Transitional Federal Institutions. In this regard the agreed road map represents a solemn commitment by the leaders of the Transitional Federal Institutions to the people of Somalia  the regional bodies and the international community as a whole.   The international community  for its part  must not lose sight of the obvious weaknesses of the Transitional Government and should endeavour to provide the necessary resources to build capacity. The Somali Government should take this opportunity to show determination  courage and leadership.  Beyond the rigours of the climate and problems they generate  the Horn of Africa is often associated with fratricidal wars. Indeed  at one point in its history each of our neighbours has been in a conflict situation. While Djibouti has spared no effort to maintain peace  in spite of ourselves we were unfortunately dragged into a border conflict with Eritrea in June 2008.   Since then  despite the best efforts of regional and international organizations and the adoption of Security Council resolutions 1862 (2009) and 1907 (2009)  Eritrea refuses to answer us about the fate of 19 prisoners of war or even to acknowledge their existence. This remains a serious concern and a source of great sadness for my people and myself.   However  despite Eritrea’s failure to comply with the clear requirements set forth in those resolutions  my Government and I remain convinced that mediation is the only way that will allow us to achieve a lasting peace. With this conviction in mind  my Government has accepted the efforts and goodwill of His Highness the Emir of Qatar. That led to the stationing of Qatari troops on the border between Djibouti and Eritrea and the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the Djibouti territory they had illegally occupied. For our part  we remain willing to cooperate fully with the sincere efforts of His Highness the Emir of Qatar  and we remain confident of the peaceful outcome of this mediation.  We will never stop believing in the virtues of dialogue and mediation  the only virtues that can enable our region to consolidate the gains of peace. The most recent example of such success is undoubtedly the birth of the new nation of South Sudan  once again demonstrating the ability of our peers to find a peaceful solution to a decades-old fratricidal conflict. Today  as the people of South Sudan take their first steps in the comity of nations  we want to assure them of our fraternal support. I am confident that they will resolve the outstanding issues peacefully.  Of course  we can only rejoice that a new Member has joined the Organization  but I could not mention the independence of South Sudan without recalling the situation that has prevailed in Palestine since 1947.   The very foundation of the United Nations consisted in fighting injustice and giving nations their sovereignty. Many countries here today  including mine  have at some point in their history found themselves here in search of independence. South Sudan became the 193rd Member State on 13 July. Palestine  for its part  continues to this day to live under occupation  which in this day and age is morally wrong and politically unsustainable.   We Africans know better than anyone the conditions in which colonized populations live. The fate experienced by the Palestinians for more than 60 years we have known  we have fought and we have overcome by obtaining the recognition of our peers. More than any other institution  for colonized peoples the United Nations represented hope: the hope for a better future  freed from the colonial yoke; the hope to live in one’s own country  enjoying freedom and one’s rights; the hope  above all  to regain dignity.   The time has come for us to give hope to our Palestinian brothers and sisters by recognizing their right to become a full-fledged State. It is time to end the siege  the poverty and the despair. History will remember  I hope  that on this day we decided to end the injustice and made the choice to finally give to Palestine a full place in the international community. History will especially remember that we have chosen not to disappoint the hopes of the fraternal people of Palestine."
"47",1931,"DMA",66,2011,"On behalf of my delegation and the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to assure him of our full cooperation. We are confident that with his skills and experience  he will bring leadership to this Assembly as it addresses the extensive and important agenda of this sixty-sixth session.   I also extend a special welcome to the newest member of this Assembly  the Republic of South Sudan  which became the 193rd Member of the United Nations in July.  I would also like to convey Dominica’s appreciation to Mr. Al-Nasser’s predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for having so ably guided the proceedings of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We also express our gratitude for the continued efforts of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon and for his leadership at this most challenging time.  This meeting is being convened at a time of tremendous global insecurity. Never in the history of humankind have we had to struggle for our own existence as we have done in this past decade. We are still faced with unstable global financial markets  issues of food availability and affordability  increasing unrest in some regions and the high cost of energy  and we seem set to endure the mounting consequences of Mother Earth’s response to decades of global warming.  Countries like Dominica  located in the Caribbean Sea  are again in hurricane season  a period    11-51687 4  of high vulnerability that we in the Caribbean experience for a period of four to six months each year. Fresh in our minds are the recent unfortunate events that took place in the eastern United States. For the first time in its recorded history  the city in which we are convened came to a complete standstill because of Hurricane Irene in late August.  We in the Caribbean understand clearly the challenges faced in the aftermath of hurricanes  as these are the kinds of disasters that small island States such as Dominica are forced to routinely schedule on our calendar of events and brace for every six months. For us  each year’s recovery efforts could become next year’s destruction point. On behalf of my delegation  I extend my condolences to and empathize with all those who were affected by Hurricane Irene.  For reasons such as these  each year we come before this Assembly to report on the deterioration not only of the environment  but also of climate change negotiations. With full knowledge that these impacts are projected to increase over time  we believe that we can build on a number of outcomes agreed to in Cancún. We also believe that although some responses might not meet every Member State’s expectation  they could act as catalysts and springboards for new approaches and new solutions in Durban.  As witnesses to environmental degradation at a time when reliance on the ecosystem to provide energy for basic needs continues to intensify  we as a people cannot continue to ignore the subject of climate change. We believe that climate change is an energy-related issue and that the provision of reliable  accessible and affordable energy and its by-products are critical to sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  Despite unfulfilled promises and a slow start to fast-start funding  we must report on actions advanced since Cancún that have helped position the small island developing States (SIDS) to transform their energy sectors. Specifically  I refer to the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative  also known as SIDS DOCK.   Almost 30 SIDS have signed an agreement to establish this initiative  created by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) under the chairmanship of Grenada and in partnership with the Government of Denmark  the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. We wish to thank the Government of Denmark for its significant financial contribution to operationalizing this facility and for the leadership that it has given and continues to give to the process. My delegation expresses its gratitude to the other members of AOSIS for staying the course and reaffirms Dominica’s commitment to the initiative.  SIDS DOCK was the outstanding outcome for SIDS at Cancún  and  as we set our sights on Durban  the expectation is that other partners will support the initiative  which is set to transform the energy sector in SIDS. It is our hope that sufficient progress will be made in negotiating appropriate measures that might be implemented to address the losses and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change  including impacts related to extreme weather as well as slow-onset events.  These two initiatives are within the framework of the Bali Road Map and Action Plan and reflect actions that are geared towards the fulfilment of commitments and giving effect to the Cancún decisions.  It is no secret that the Kyoto Protocol is in serious trouble. While it represents less than 30 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions  it remains the only legally binding global agreement in our quest to address the growing threat of climate change. In order to build on the gains made under the first commitment period  we must ensure that the broad principles secured in the Kyoto Protocol are maintained in any legally binding global agreement at Durban.  A sustainable energy sector is the foundation for sustainable development in small island States such as Dominica. For the past decade  Dominica has been working towards the development of our geothermal potential  with the assistance of international agencies and development partners.  With the support and contribution of the European Union  the Government of France and the Regional Councils of Guadeloupe and Martinique  we are now closer to the realization of our goal. Preparation for drilling has begun  and the three test wells will be complete by the end of 2011.  The development of our geothermal potential will provide us with the capacity to meet our domestic needs and supply electricity to our neighbouring islands  especially the French territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique  through our connection via submarine cables. With this displacement of hundreds of megawatts of fossil-generated power  coupled with our   5 11-51687  sustainable development practices  Dominica’s target is to be not only carbon-neutral but also carbon-negative by the year 2020.  Like Dominica  many SIDS are pursuing their own renewable-energy initiatives. However  unsustainable debt burdens and lack of technology have made such initiatives almost impossible for some SIDS. We invite other developed countries and international institutions to join the Government of Denmark in SIDS DOCK and the Government of Norway in its “Energy for all” initiative  by providing the critical support that SIDS so desperately need.  We in the SIDS are committed to playing our part; suffice it to say  however  that there are still some major obstacles impeding the pace of progress  particularly financing for SIDS-appropriate technology and transfer. As part of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) process  Dominica calls on the Secretary-General to establish a special SIDS-appropriate technology fund to address the issue of innovative financing for sustainable energy technology transfer and development for small island States. In that regard  we also ask that the Secretary-General consider appointing a goodwill ambassador tasked with advocating on behalf of SIDS and helping the Secretary-General in supporting the Fund. The effective transfer and development of SIDS-appropriate technology is essential for SIDS to build resilience to the present and future impacts of climate change.  In addition to looking forward to securing a renewed political commitment for sustainable development at Rio+20  the SIDS expect that the international community will reaffirm their support with the new and additional resources required to implement the programmes and activities agreed to  from Agenda 21 to the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.   Any renewed commitments and agreements reached at Rio+20 must address the major impediments to implementing these summit outcomes  including the limited technical  financial and human resources  as well as the impact of exogenous factors  particularly the global financial crisis.  There is no denying the importance of national security to a society; thus the unregulated  non-standardized and highly dangerous trade in arms and ammunition poses great threats to law and order in our societies. The Caribbean region is not a manufacturer of arms or ammunition  yet large quantities of illegal firearms and ammunition often associated with the illegal drug trade are transferred across our borders  infiltrating our society and causing mayhem and death  overburdening our health-care system and contributing to the destabilization of economic progress and well-being. The region has lost some of its most productive members to this unregulated transfer of arms. This is an unsustainable situation for any country  but even more so for small island States.  Negotiations on an arms trade treaty are welcome  and  as stated in the Caribbean Community Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons  Dominica is committed to full and active participation in all efforts related to the issue of small arms. Of particular importance is the 2012 review of the 2001 Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  as well as the 2012 United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty.  In the absence of these and other initiatives to help combat global insecurity  threats to global peace and security will continue to multiply in both intensity and form. Multilateralism must take centre stage in the struggle to deal with these challenges. The work of the United Nations is therefore paramount in maintaining world peace and security. In its maintenance of this role  the United Nations must be able to clearly demonstrate legitimacy and fairness in its actions  cognizant always of the need to protect the most vulnerable.  The ability of the Security Council to adequately respond to new and changing world dynamics rests with its acceptance of the need for continuous reform to adapt to the times  including a recognition of the increase in size of the United Nations membership and global economic power shifts. Reform reflects more than representation and  in this situation  should promote adaptation to the needs of Members and the drafting of strategies that would contribute to ending wars and halting disputes.  In that regard  we welcome Mr. Al-Nasser’s proposal of “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” as the theme for the high-level debate at the opening of this session of the General Assembly.    11-51687 6   Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague mankind in this era of globalization. I also highlighted the need for multilateralism and for cooperation between and among States. These challenges can be overcome only in a global environment where there exists respect for one another’s territorial integrity  non-interference in one another’s domestic affairs  respect for sovereignty and the right of self-determination. It is in this context that we again call on the United States of America to discontinue its economic blockade against the people of the Republic of Cuba.  I also welcome the support of the President of the Assembly in keeping our sister island of Haiti on the global stage. There are few words left to describe the dire misery in which our brothers and sisters in Haiti are living. The paralysis of reconstruction and development activities has been the hallmark of the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated that country in January 2010.   We recognize the tremendous challenges to the reconstruction efforts and wish to thank those countries  institutions and individuals who have contributed and continue to contribute towards this process. We again call on those who have made pledges to make good on their commitments in order to accelerate the reconstruction efforts.  The presence of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) remains critical to the reconstruction efforts by providing security and support to the people of Haiti. We therefore urge the Security Council to extend the tenure of MINUSTAH to facilitate the efforts of the new Administration of His Excellency President Michel Martelly.  We all accept that it is critical to collectively address the impact of climate change  to resolve conflicts throughout the world and to enhance peace and security for humanity. All these efforts  however  will be of little value to our peoples if we are not able to ensure that they are healthy. The United Nations has shown exemplary leadership in dealing with the fight against HIV/AIDS  together with its partners. This same leadership must now be given to the fight against non-communicable diseases.  The frightening statistics of 2008 issued by the World Health Organization  which estimated that 36 million deaths worldwide were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  suggests that this phenomenon is not unique to any one region and therefore cannot be downplayed. NCDs pose one of the greatest challenges to the health and development of Dominica  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the rest of the world. The severe impacts of non-communicable diseases continue to place tremendous pressures on our health-care systems  productivity and already overburdened and struggling economies.  It was for these reasons that the CARICOM Heads of Government issued the Port of Spain Declaration in 2007 to promote healthy lifestyles and to combat NCDs in our region. Prior to and since the declaration  the Dominican Government has adopted a national policy on NCDs. We have further implemented a number of measures as part of our multisectoral efforts to include education; the strengthening of our primary health-care system with the contribution of our partners  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Cuba; the promotion of healthy lifestyles; greater access to treatment and free health care; and appropriate legislative and policy changes. The Government of Dominica endorses the leadership taken by the Caribbean Community in this regard. We remain committed to the well-being of every citizen.  We join our CARICOM colleagues in thanking the United Nations Member States and Secretariat for convening the successful High-level Meeting on NCDs. We look forward to the implementation of the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2) and call on the developed countries to partner with us in our various efforts to combat NCDs.  Finally  Dominica wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the United Nations system as the ultimate negotiating and deliberating body for addressing major challenges confronting the world. The Assembly can count on Dominica’s commitment to working in close collaboration with the United Nations agencies and respective Member States to strengthen the mission of this body. We cannot overemphasize the fact that  notwithstanding its many limitations and imperfections  the United Nations system is critical to maintaining world peace and security and an international humanitarian system. The world today is a much better place because of the United Nations."
"48",1975,"DNK",66,2011,"First of all  I would like to align myself with the statement made by the President of the European Council  Mr. Herman van Rompuy  on behalf of the European Union (see ). Denmark appreciates the adoption earlier this year of    11-51687 10  resolution 65/276  giving the European Union (EU) the opportunity to address the General Assembly at this juncture of its deliberations. The Lisbon Treaty marks a new phase of European cooperation that will benefit the United Nations as well.  The past year has once again demonstrated how quickly events can unfold and how unexpected crises can break out in different parts of the world. These include a violent conflict in Côte d’Ivoire before a democratically elected president could finally take his rightful place; devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan  followed by nuclear contamination; the current and still more severe humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa; and Pakistan being struck by overwhelming floods.  There have also been events of historic proportions that are still unfolding in North Africa and the Middle East. From Tunisia to Egypt  from Libya to Syria  from Bahrain to Yemen and beyond  people are demanding their rights and their freedom. They are standing up for core human aspirations and values. They want to shape their own lives  economically and politically. Theirs is a call for political participation  for freedom of speech and for the right of peaceful assembly; a call for dignity  for accountability  for justice and for jobs. It has sparked hope for a better life for the people of the region. The international community  with the United Nations in the lead  has a strong responsibility to support these historic aspirations.  The winds of change currently sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa have confirmed once again that the desire for freedom  democratic reforms and respect for human rights is universal. A few days ago  countries met under the auspices of the Secretary-General to express their admiration for the courage of the Libyan people in their struggle to take control of their own future. Denmark is proud to have supported the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people and to have contributed to the protection of the lives of Libyan civilians.   A few days ago  the Assembly welcomed the National Transitional Council (NTC) as the representative of Libya. Being here today with the NTC in the seat of Libya is tangible evidence of the progress achieved by the Libyan people in determining their own destiny. Along with the international community  Denmark continues to support the aspirations of the Libyan people. It is encouraging that the Security Council has now authorized a new United Nations Mission to support Libyan national efforts.  Developments across the Middle East and North Africa make it clear that in the twenty-first century  Governments must be politically accountable  respect people’s rights and dignity  and deliver economic opportunities. The only credible response to those legitimate popular demands is sustainable political and economic reforms.  Unfortunately  we sometimes witness countries fail to live up to their responsibility and obligations as members of the international community. As we speak  events continue to unfold across the region  including in Syria. More than 2 600 people in Syria have died during the popular uprising. We strongly condemn the violence and the killings of peaceful demonstrators. It is high time to respect the right of peaceful protesters and their legitimate demands. To increase the pressure on the Syrian regime  we have adopted sanctions and hope others will join us.  Some of the prerequisites for a sustainable transition to a flourishing democracy are free  fair and transparent elections  free media  the protection of minorities  a functioning government and an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law. Democratic change must come from within. It has to be home-grown and based on local leadership  ownership and participation. Surely  this does not exclude international assistance  including from the United Nations.  Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of the Taliban regime. We hope that Afghanistan will take yet another step in its transition process at the upcoming Conference in Bonn in December. Moving towards 2014  the United Nations system  in close cooperation with the Afghan authorities  will also have to undertake a thorough review of its activities in Afghanistan in order to continuously maximize its contribution to good governance  anti-corruption and sustainable socio-economic development.  What we see around the world is not only a call for political reforms; it is also a call for inclusive economic development  for jobs pure and simple  and for improved standards of living. And not least  it is a call from and about youth. Governments will need to strengthen economic and social reforms  ensuring that   11 11-51687  they generate inclusive growth and shared prosperity for all and not just for the few and already privileged.   The Millennium Development Goals have succeeded in galvanizing action  not least in health and education  and all countries have a joint obligation to ensure that the goals we agreed in 2000 will actually be fulfilled by 2015. The development challenge is pressing in sub-Saharan Africa  a region long marked by poverty and conflict  but in recent years also characterized in many countries by strong economic growth and optimism.  National ownership and clear political commitments remain the keys to success. But for many of the poorest countries  development cooperation continues to be an important tool and a catalyst in their efforts to ensure that the poorest people will also be able to enjoy the full potential of globalization. Denmark is doing its part to assist  based on a sound track record in international development cooperation. We are one of only five countries which at present fulfil the internationally agreed development goal of delivering at least 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development assistance. We would like to welcome others to this “point-seven” club.  We shall not succeed  however  without focusing in particular on countries affected by conflict or fragility. We especially look to the United Nations to coordinate efforts in those countries. That is where the United Nations can make a real difference.  The advancement of women’s equality and the empowerment of women are important aspects of this process. We welcome the creation of UN-Women and look forward to working closely with that new entity in the area of gender mainstreaming. No less important is the issue of sexual and reproductive health and the rights of women.  The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012  presents a unique opportunity to revitalize the discussion and understanding of sustainable development. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to put sustainable development at the top of the global development agenda.  Denmark welcomes the focus on green economy and the institutional framework for sustainable development. Transitioning to a green economy is necessary if the world is to cope with the multiple challenges of resource scarcity  poverty eradication and climate change. Economic growth will be crucial in the decades ahead  but it will have to be green. Today  1.4 billion people are without access to modern sources of energy. Universal access to energy will contribute to lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty.  Poland and Denmark  as part of the EU trio presidency for 2011 and 2012  are working jointly to strengthen the green growth agenda and contribute to the global objective of sustainable development  in accordance with the trio presidency programme. Next month  Denmark will host the first Global Green Growth Forum in Copenhagen. The Forum will lend new momentum to public-private cooperation on concrete initiatives that will inspire regulatory interventions  remove key barriers and identify opportunities and solutions for a renewed push to advance green growth globally.  Earlier this year  we witnessed the birth of a new State as we welcomed the 193rd Member of the United Nations. The Republic of South Sudan is the fulfilment of the democratically expressed will to self-determination by the overwhelming majority of the South Sudanese people. We congratulate the people of South Sudan on their historic achievement.  The Palestinian cause and quest for statehood are high on the agenda here in New York  and rightly so. The present regional context reminds us all  including the two parties  that direct political peace negotiations must now be resumed. Within a specific time frame  they must produce a lasting peace and an end to conflict based on the two-State solution  with both States living side by side in peace and security.  Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his appointment to a second five-year term. We have all been inspired by his tireless efforts in the field of peace and security and human rights and by his strong leadership on climate change and sustainable development. At a time when the United Nations is ever more relevant  Denmark lends its full support to the Secretary-General and to his stewardship of the Organization. The challenges we face call for international resolve and for joint action. In the Secretary-General’s own words  “We need results that people can see and touch  results that change lives and make a difference” (A/65/PV.101  p. 9). That is why we turn to the United Nations.    11-51687 12   That is the end of my prepared statement  but I am aware that I am the last speaker in the general debate of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let me therefore also take this opportunity on my own behalf — and I am sure also on behalf of speakers before me — to thank the conference service staff and the interpreters for their tireless efforts and long working days  which have facilitated this unique international debate.  The exchange of views that we have during the general debate allows each and every one of us a privileged glimpse into the positions  the values and the political priorities of all 193 Member States. The debate provides a strong and clear indication of what issues really engage Governments. It demonstrates what parts of the very broad United Nations agenda each and every Government is most preoccupied with  what their concerns are and which outcomes and solutions they seek. From this debate  we get a unique and straight look into the soul of global politics. It helps us understand each other  including when we disagree  and it informs our work together in the Assembly in the months to come.  So we may congratulate each other on a job well done  now at the end of the debate  but it is only the beginning. The true value of this debate will be seen only later  and it will depend on all of us coming together to find common ground and workable solutions."
"49",2020,"DOM",66,2011,"We extend our warmest congratulations to the Ambassador from Qatar  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We welcome his intention to use this session to address pressing issues such as mediation and conflict resolution  the reform of the United Nations system  preventing and responding to natural disasters and sustainable development for global prosperity.  Ten years ago  the dynamic and vibrant city of New York was shocked by something previously inconceivable: the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. Thousands of innocent people died in horrific ways  leaving relatives and friends in a state of helplessness and sorrow. Echoes of that terror reverberated around the planet  leaving scars and a trail of pain to this day. The world has not been the same since then.  In the interest of security  even in strong democracies where genuine rule of law prevails  some individual liberties  previously considered sacred and immutable  have been sacrificed. While the ashes were still smouldering and the rubble of the Twin Towers still lay where it fell  the war in Afghanistan was launched  which  although perhaps justified as a case of legitimate defence  has nevertheless produced more victims than the terrorist attacks themselves. Then came the occupation of Iraq  which spurred controversy in various circles of international public opinion but in any case certainly generated more violence  produced new victims and new waves of human suffering and caused more destruction of wealth.  The lesson to be learned from these past 10 years is that there must be a collective effort to eliminate terrorism as an inhuman practice  to eliminate as well the economic  social  political  cultural  ideological and religious factors that fuel it  and to promote a world that is more open  more tolerant  more respectful and more willing to engage in dialogue and in the recognition of human dignity.  Another event that has shaken the world during the past decade has been the global financial crisis  produced by a lack of clear rules in the international financial system  as well as by arrogance  greed and the unquenchable thirst for wealth. That crisis has gone through several stages  but at this moment what is most worrisome is that it has caused a division among the most influential and powerful political and economic sectors in the world over strategies to fix it. While some think that what is needed at this time is public-spending stimulus policies to promote economic growth and job creation  others emphasize reducing fiscal deficits and paying off sovereign debt.  How can international capital markets now demand that Governments pay a debt that was created  to a large extent  to save financial institutions from going under in the first place? Although incongruous    11 11-50871  that is exactly what is taking place. Markets are currently putting pressure on States to pay sovereign debts that were themselves essentially the result of earlier initiatives by States to rescue banks that were either at risk or on the brink of bankruptcy.   In order to avoid having to stop payments or defaulting and watching their economies crumble further  Governments have had to give in to the pressure of the markets by implementing severe austerity measures. Those policies have significantly decreased citizens’ quality of life  leading to social unrest and protest movements that erode Governments’ legitimacy and support base. Although it might seem paradoxical  in some developed countries loss of popular support has caused Governments to fall  which  in echoes of coups d’état  have led to a new political phenomenon that might be called  for lack of a better word  market “coups”.  What is strange about this situation is that what we need is resources to save the international financial system  stabilize the world economy and return us to our earlier levels of economic growth and prosperity — and those resources are at hand. For example  it is known that even though $4 trillion circulate every day around the world in the form of financial transactions in capital markets  no taxes are in place that would increase States’ fiscal resources.   How much would Governments collect through a 5 per cent tax on the $4 trillion circulating daily around the world? That would represent $20 billion per day  which  multiplied by five business days a week  would come to a total of $100 billion. If  in turn  we multiply that number by four weeks a month we would have monthly income of $400 billion. And those $400 billion monthly  multiplied by 12 months in a year  amount to an astronomical $4.8 trillion. That amount would not only resolve the problems of some countries’ sovereign debt but there would be enough fresh resources for investing  which would allow a rapid recovery from the current financial and economic world crisis.  Nonetheless  were we to conclude that this was not an appropriate way for States to raise revenue  what about the more than 10 trillion dollars deposited in tax havens  according to reports by international advisory institutions?  As we know  not a cent from those deposits  which increase by more than 600 billion dollars every year  reaches the tax services of any Government.  In the meantime  through our failure to tax international financial transactions and the deposits made in tax havens  the global financial and economic crisis continues  citizens become indignant as they see their standard of living erode  social demonstrations multiply  Governments are threatened by the lack of governance  chaos takes over societies  and uncertainty expands everywhere.  In sum  we are forced to accept increasingly alarming levels of social injustice because of the undeniable and uncontrollable power held by a circle of the world’s economic elite.  Despite the wide range of global problems before us  I wish to address just one of them: financial speculation on the price of food and oil. The Dominican Republic will submit a draft resolution on the subject to this Assembly General.  Since 2005 there has been a steady increase in the prices of food and oil  along with that of petroleum by-products.   From 2006 to 2008  the price of soya beans has increased 107 per cent; the price of corn  125 per cent; rice  127 per cent; and wheat  136 per cent.  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  as a result of those price increases  150 million people joined those around the world who already literally go hungry.  As a result  for the first time in the history of humankind  the total number of people who lack access to food surpassed 1 billion  which represents almost a sixth of the world population.  With the recession that took place during the second half of 2008  food prices went down  and it was thought that we would return to a situation of accessible food prices and overall increased stability.   However  with the slight upturn and reactivation of the world economy in 2010  prices went up again  and this year the ravages of inflation have been felt once again in different parts of the world.  The same has happened with the price of oil. After falling to $12 a barrel in 1998  ten years later  in July 2008  two months before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers  it was priced at $147 a barrel.    11-50871 12   Paradoxically  at the end of 2008  oil prices had dropped so precipitously that the new price on the international market was $37 a barrel.  Who could possibly explain something as absurd as a price drop from $147 to $37 a barrel in just four months?  It has been argued that  with regard to both food and oil  those exorbitant price increases can be explained by the growth of the world population  an increase in demand from emerging economies  especially China and India  the effects of climate change  and geo-political tensions in regions of the world affected by conflict.  There can be no doubt that some of those factors have influenced prices to some extent  but there has also been a clear effort to downplay the importance of a new element in international markets: financial speculation in commodity futures.  According to well-known international analysts  30 to 40 per cent of the price increases for commodities or basic products can be ascribed to the impact or influence of financial speculation on futures contracts.  In light of that situation  which has a daily impact on our food- and oil-importing people  the Dominican Republic has weighed the need to propose regulatory measures of international scope in order to guarantee market transparency and price stability.  To that end  it is essential to limit the volume of transactions that may be executed by such futures market participants as insurance companies  investment banks  pension funds and equity funds  among others  which play no direct part in the physical production of the product.  Likewise  deposits on futures contracts should be raised  as a way to discourage speculative transactions that only contribute to price volatility and create uncertainty and a lack of market predictability.  We believe that by adopting such a resolution we will take an important step towards solving a serious problem that has condemned a large part of humankind to hunger and destitution.  In sum  the objective of this initiative is simple  just  and of far-reaching importance  namely  to persuade the Assembly General of the United Nations to declare  for the sake of the human race  that food cannot be considered a financial asset.  Food must be used only to guarantee the survival of the human race on the face of the Earth."
"50",2067,"DZA",66,2011,"His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  President of the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria  has given me the honour of delivering this address to the General Assembly. At the outset  I wish to congratulate the President of the General Assembly for his assumption of the presidency at its sixty-sixth session. His professional experience in the United Nations and his personal qualities will undoubtedly lead to the excellent conduct and success of our work.   I also pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his efforts. Finally  I reiterate my congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General  upon his reappointment and express my country’s satisfaction for the dynamic manner by which he is leading the work and role of the Organization.  Now that the Republic of South Sudan has joined the family of the United Nations  on behalf of my country  I warmly congratulate the people and the Government of that kindred country.   The main theme of this session  namely  the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  was chosen at a time of aggravated tensions  the recurrence of economic and financial crises  increasing unresolved challenges and diminished efforts and cooperation in multilateralism.   Today’s globalized but confused world has strayed from its social structures and balances and been crisscrossed by new  unregulated influences and unequal relationships. Therefore  the international system that was established in 1945 requires today adaptation to current demands in order to respond to the expectations of the people of the world.   Algeria is following with special interest the ongoing events in some countries in its region  which have led to numerous lives lost and huge material damage. Algeria deplores the violence experienced in some countries  and reiterates its call for a political settlement of all of those ongoing situations  based on the aspirations of the people for freedom  justice and democracy  and respect for each country’s sovereignty and for international law.  With respect to Libya  Algeria expects a rapid restoration of peace and security and the formation of a Government that represents all sections of Libyan society. We are convinced that Libya’s stability is a fundamental element for the stability of the region as a whole. From this podium  Algeria reaffirms its determination to work immediately with the new Libyan authorities to promote full  exemplary bilateral collaboration based on a spirit of brotherhood and solidarity.  Recent developments on the Arab stage will not fail to directly affect the situation prevailing in the Middle East. Continued Israeli occupation of Palestine and other occupied Arab territories  as well as the lack of genuine prospects for just and lasting peace in the region are  in that regard  a source of deep concern for Algeria. The stalemated peace process in the Middle East  the continued building of settlements and the continued campaign to Judaize the holy city of Al-Quds continue daily to further distance any prospect of a just and lasting peace based on the principle of land for peace.  That situation  which weighs heavy with risk and uncertainty in an already sensitive region  is both an affront to the peoples of the region and a challenge for the entire international community. Among those    11-51390 6  challenges  the inhumane embargo of Gaza and its seacoast constitutes a genuine collective punishment of its inhabitants.   The Palestinian Authority’s initiative  at this session  requesting that Palestine be recognized as a full Member State of the United Nations is an opportunity for the United Nations to correct  to some extent  an injustice that has lasted for over 60 years now. This admission will be a clear  unequivocal response by the international community showing its determination to impose international law and to reject a policy of fait accompli.   In the same context  Algeria reiterates its concern at the persistence of coercive economic measures and unilateral sanctions against developing countries. I would recall in this respect the embargo that has been imposed against Cuba for over half a century now.   There is another issue on the agenda of the United Nations that calls for special attention  namely  the situation in the Western Sahara. Indeed  no effort must be spared in promoting the path of dialogue and negotiation  which is the only way that will enable the Saharawi people to freely express their right to self-determination. In this context  Algeria reiterates its commitment to provide full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy  and appeals to both parties  Morocco and the Frente Polisario  to demonstrate a spirit of responsibility in settling this conflict  which has unfortunately lasted all too long.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The time has come for the international community to reiterate its full commitment to the fight against international terrorism. The progress made to date to eradicate this scourge does not yet satisfy us  nor does it allow us to let down our guard. On the contrary  we should remain ready to contribute appropriate solutions to the root causes of terrorism and its many ramifications.   Algeria would thus take this opportunity to stress the threefold need to  first  reach the necessary consensus to hasten the adoption of an international convention against terrorism; secondly  adopt a protocol prohibiting the paying of ransoms to terrorist groups; and finally  prevent the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes.   In order for this approach to succeed  we must ensure a return to strict respect for the fundamentals of our cooperation  the preservation of the universal character of our Organization  the primacy of international law and the full application of the rules of multilateralism.  The current weaknesses of world governance are illustrated on a daily basis in the various crises that we face. In this respect  I would refer first to the inability of the United Nations in general  and the Security Council in particular  to manage conflicts that threaten international peace and security or even to ensure the implementation of their own resolutions. Secondly  I would refer to the recent global economic and financial crisis and its devastating effects  in particular its impact on developing countries’ economies. This crisis has exposed a system subject to the vagaries of the market  which responds more to the need for large private companies to make a profit than to the need for growth and development. This system excludes the countries of the South from both the management of relevant international institutions and from setting the rules that govern them. Thirdly  I would mention the tragic effects of climate change  which are a real threat to the future of the international community.   Given these realities  we must adopt  within the framework of the United Nations  a global  inclusive approach in order to  first  ensure general reform of the United Nations as a precondition to the establishment of financial institutions that can respond to the expectations of our countries and counter speculative movements and the virtual markets’ dominance over the realities of the world economy. Secondly  the reform of the United Nations should make it possible for an effective collective security system to emerge that will be able to respond to the breadth and complexity of the challenges that the international community faces. Thirdly  we must ensure the success of upcoming events and programmes on the United Nations agenda  in order to achieve real awareness-raising and so that decisive action can be taken to settle the problems caused by climate change.  If Algeria is encouraging the adoption of a global approach at this crucial point of the world’s development  it is because it has participated in certain initiatives that have demonstrated how effective they can be at the regional level. Here  I would refer to the many efforts undertaken by the Sahel countries  along with their partners  during the international conference on development and the fight against terrorism held recently in Algeria. This allowed us to make important   7 11-51390  decisions on containing the phenomenon of terrorism  reducing its effects and attacking its root causes. Beyond the fight against terrorism  the conference also insisted on highlighting a priority that is often forgotten  which is putting the issue of development at the very heart of all cooperation efforts. Such cooperation  which is currently very crucial at the regional level  requires support from our partners that responds to the needs expressed by our countries.  I would like to devote the last part of my comments to recent measures undertaken by my country to reinforce political  economic and social reforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law and good governance. On the political and institutional levels  these reforms include a review of the Constitution  the adoption of a new law on information and the media  the decriminalization of press offences  an opening of audiovisual media  an amendment of the law on political parties and of the electoral law  and the strengthening of the role of women in elected bodies.   These political reforms are based on our firm desire to promote human rights as broadly as possible  as was reiterated to all the special rapporteurs who have visited Algeria since November 2010.  On the economic level  decisive measures have been taken to improve the business climate  free up productive energy and reinforce the role of companies and institutions as the drivers of growth and development. On the social level  as Algeria is concerned about the future of its youth  it has increased the number of its assistance and employment programmes for the various categories of youth so that they can make a smooth integration into the labour market. These measures will of course lead to a strengthening of the democratic process and of the rule of law through an inclusive approach that brings together all the political and social forces in my country."
"51",2114,"ECU",66,2011,"In June 2009  humankind was still witnessing with perplexity the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and its devastating consequences on employment  hunger  poverty  trade  foreign direct investment  credit  tourism  remittances and health and education. At that time  my country  Ecuador  felt a moral obligation to participate  through its head of State  in the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  convened by the then-President of the General Assembly  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann.    11-51681 28   On that occasion  the President of the Republic of Ecuador emphasized that the global financial debacle  which  it goes without saying  originated in the main financial markets of the North  was a symptom of crisis in a system in which the speculative-financial economy took precedence over the real economy. In other words  that system entailed waiting for money to create more money and stability of its own accord  instead of stimulating the production of goods and services to meet the needs of human beings.  For Ecuador  the gravity of the crisis alone should have marked a shift towards a stronger role for the United Nations in global economic governance  with a view to overhauling the international financial system and democratizing international relations by establishing a new world economic order.  Unfortunately  with the exception of a scant few cosmetic changes in the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions  the paradoxical multi-million-dollar bailout of the some of the sectors responsible for the crisis and a fragile mechanism to follow up on the commitments contained in the Outcome of the 2009 Conference (resolution 63/303  annex)  nothing has changed. The world continues to await some sign of financial and monetary regulation and coordination that would ensure economic stability  access to credit  full and productive employment  trade financing  debt sustainability  social safety nets and  of course  a true global alliance that would protect and promote development to benefit our people  which is the sole objective of our efforts.  In its current state  the United Nations has been unable to rise to the challenges stemming from global economic instability  which have been exacerbated by this new stage in the 2009 financial crisis. That is why Ecuador is aggressively and resolutely promoting the creation of a new regional financial architecture capable of mitigating the adverse consequences affecting our economies as a result of their involvement in the international financial system.  In that regard  and without abandoning the pursuit of comprehensive reforms of the global financial and economic system  my country has suggested an approach  while taking into account the political  economic and social circumstances of each region  involving the adoption of regional monetary agreements that include a semi-flexible exchange rate regime and a common reserve fund so as to create a truly regional exchange rate regime and a regional currency.  In the case of Latin America  this proposal had its origins in Latin American forums through the creation of the Bank of the South. Its main aim is to fund multinational development projects and to bolster local and regional currencies linked to a common reserve fund for Latin America  which would enable us to deal with the crisis and prevent billions of dollars from our region being paradoxically deposited into the banks of developed countries. In the same way  this fund is complemented by a regional payment system  which has started to work through the Unified Regional Payment Clearing System  with excellent results to date. This system is leading the way towards a common physical currency in our region.  These regional initiatives can  and should be  integrated into a regional integration framework that extends beyond the economic and financial spheres. Such is the case with the Union of South American Nations  the headquarters and secretariat of which is located in our capital  Quito  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America — Peoples’ Trade Agreement. My country stresses that these regional responses should be considered as complementing the urgent global measures required for better understanding and cooperation among regions.   At the same time  Ecuador urgently calls for a comprehensive reform of the world economic and financial system  including measures such as the creation of an economic coordination council and an independent mechanism to restructure and solve the problem of sovereign debt  which  among other proposals  should be discussed in a follow-up meeting to the 2009 conference.  However  apart from the economic and financial crisis  the crisis of multilateralism has also been reflected in the lack of a timely and suitable response by the United Nations to the political crises that have occurred  in particular in the Middle East. These have once again demonstrated the urgent need to conclude the long-delayed process of a comprehensive reform of the Security Council. This reform of one of the main organs of the United Nations should be primarily aimed at democratizing its decision-making mechanisms  guaranteeing full respect for the principle of equitable geographic distribution  including regional   29 11-51681  representation  improving the Council’s working methods and strengthening the relationship between the Council and the General Assembly. All of this would provide the Council with the necessary legitimacy  effectiveness and representativeness to implement its mandates.  At the sixty-fifth session  Ecuador took over the chairmanship of the Special Committee on Decolonization with the conviction that  starting in 2011  which marked the beginning of the third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism  we need new strategies that will lead  in the near future  to the decolonization of those territories that are still on the Committee’s list.   Ecuador recognizes that peaceful means of solving disputes are the only legitimate mechanisms capable of guaranteeing sustainable and lasting peace for peoples. Among these is mediation  the central theme proposed by the President of the Assembly for the sixty-sixth session. Imposing solutions by force will never perpetuate peace — quite the opposite. We have witnessed the failure of these methods  which leads to war. We have suffered the failure of these wars. My country condemns abusive interpretations of Security Council resolutions  which systematically lead to more violence  bloodshed and human rights violations and which do not foster friendly relations among countries.   Ecuador’s position with regard to the Middle East has as its founding principle our full adherence to the standards and principles of international law and strict compliance with United Nations resolutions. Forty-three years after having accepted the partition of Palestine into two States  on 24 December 2010 the Government of Ecuador  in a gesture of historic justice  recognized Palestine as a free and independent State  within its 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. My country therefore gave its full support to accepting Palestine’s request to become a full State Member of the United Nations  as formally requested by the Palestinian President a few days ago. We also support all initiatives directed towards consolidating lasting peace  to benefit not only Palestine and Israel  but the entire region. This is a historic time for the United Nations  and Ecuador hopes that the Organization will rise to the occasion.  Concerning our region  Ecuador once again firmly condemns the economic  trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against Cuba and demands the immediate and unconditional lifting of all unilateral measures imposed in an extraterritorial fashion by that country against our sister Caribbean nation. The blockade has inflicted serious economic  social and even humanitarian suffering on the population.  With regard to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held in Rio de Janeiro  20 years after the adoption of the international principles and instruments that set a new course for international relations  we are now reaching a watershed moment. Through it  we will be able to take stock of the implementation  both in the past and over the coming decades  of these principles and instruments. This would enable renewed political commitment to sustainable development  which will require action on the three pillars  which we define as the economic  social and environmental areas.   In order to implement the elements pending from the Rio conventions  Ecuador believes that we should  first  comply with commitments to reduce greenhouse gases in order to stabilize the temperature at levels that will enable us to restore balance to the planet while upholding the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities and equity; secondly  insist on the transfer of the new and additional financial resources promised by developed countries  considering the huge efforts that we developing countries are making in facing global threats; thirdly  remember that sustainability is not just an environmental question  but a shift in the relationships between capital  labour  nature and politics; fourthly  fix terms for technology transfers that will enable developing countries to make progress in capacity-building and in finding options in their pursuit of sustainable development; and fifthly  draft international instruments in the field of sustainable development in order to achieve equality  not just with regard to a green economy or a strengthened institutional framework  but also in order to include development in the comprehensive approach to improving quality of life  with adequate links between the three pillars to which I have referred — what we in Ecuador call “living well”.  Four years ago  here in the Hall  my country made an unequivocal gesture of its commitment to the fight against the global challenge of climate change and the promotion of sustainable development. Indeed  in 2007  Ecuador presented to the world the forward-   11-51681 30  looking Yasuní ITT initiative  an innovative and revolutionary idea. Under the initiative  the State of Ecuador committed to leaving 856 million barrels of oil underground indefinitely under the Yasuní National Park  thereby preventing the emission of 407 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that would have been produced by the burning of these fossil fuels. All this was conceived as a swap in compensation for the estimated value of 50 per cent of the revenue that the exploitation of those resources would generate.   The Yasuní-ITT initiative  known today throughout the world  represents a concrete  effective measure for combating climate change and preserving the rich biodiversity of the area  along with its water  the rights of indigenous people living in the park and nature itself. By foregoing the right to exploit the oil reserves that lie beneath the Yasuní National Park and the economic resources that would be required to develop them  Ecuador hopes that the international community will contribute at least half of what the country would have received in profit  acting under the principle of co-responsibility on the part of countries that have historically been most responsible for climate change.  In a parallel event that took place here at the United Nations on 23 September with the support of the Secretary-General and the President  President Rafael Correa reminded the international community about the Yasuní-ITT initiative. The proposal has been enthusiastically received by countries  organizations  citizens  visionaries and leaders from around the world  adding up to significant support from both individuals and the private sector. That response has allowed Ecuador to broaden its initiative in a manner that will transform the governance of public resources at the global level. For example  we have begun to shape the concept of net avoided emissions  which President Correa introduced last year at the Cancún Climate Change Conference. That and the Yasuní-ITT initiative are two visionary proposals from a developing oil-producing nation of the South as a contribution to global challenges in the area of sustainable development.   Throughout this session  Ecuador will continue to defend with particular emphasis the right to development  the human right to water  the rights of indigenous peoples  the rights of women  girls and boys  the rights of people with disabilities  the rights of older adult men and women  the rights of migrant workers and their families and the rights of all vulnerable members of society.   For this reason  my country reiterates its concern about  and rejects  legislation adopted by certain States whose application leads to measures or practices that restrict the full exercise of migrant workers’ human rights and fundamental freedoms. By the same token  we reaffirm that even as they exercise their sovereign right to implement such measures to control their borders  States have the obligation to guarantee the human rights of migrant workers and should promote measures that favour family unification and the protection of minors. States also have the responsibility to strengthen laws that punish any act of violence against migrant workers  particularly hate crimes that foment discrimination based on ethnic  racial or religious differences  as well as crimes against migrant workers that are committed with racist or xenophobic motives.  Ecuador is a peaceful land that espouses universal disarmament and condemns the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. For that reason  we place great importance on disarmament and international security  and note with concern the shrinking space for enforcing agreements in those areas.  The international community has not produced a single instrument through which the nuclear States pledge to refrain from using nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries during the process aimed at destroying all such arms. It would seem that within the Conference on Disarmament the only interest and concern is to advance within the framework of nuclear proliferation  downgrading or  even worse  marginalizing all possibility of progress in the realm of nuclear disarmament. For that reason  my country supports the ongoing negotiation process within the Conference on Disarmament  which includes all pending matters.  As a proponent of universal disarmament  peace and sustainable development in harmony with nature  and as a signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which established the world’s first nuclear-free region  Ecuador sincerely hopes that the pending aspects regarding the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East will be resolved.   31 11-51681   My country wishes to express its full support for initiatives aimed at establishing transparency in the area of conventional weapons and for combating illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons  including landmines and cluster bombs. We also support measures taken within the context of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We look forward to the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty  whose outcome document should be an objective  predictable and non-discriminatory instrument.  Since 1953  Ecuador has been part of the great United Nations undertaking to maintain peace and security across the world. We have increasingly contributed to United Nations armed forces for peacekeeping missions in various countries. We are currently participating in Haiti  Chad  Côte d’Ivoire  Liberia  the Central African Republic and the Sudan.  Since 2004  we have participated in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti as part of the Chilean-Ecuadoran company of engineers that is helping to build new infrastructure for that country’s development  with due recognition from the authorities and the local populace.  Ecuador foresees increasing its participation in peacekeeping operations  but our intentions go beyond that. As a troop-contributing country  we wish to increase the number of units and armed forces personnel taking part in such operations. We have made great efforts to show our commitment to joining the international community in its struggle to ensure that regions experiencing the greatest upheaval can resolve their differences and achieve the peace that is so necessary.   Let us not be deceived — global multilateralism is in deep crisis. The United Nations system has not adequately responded to the convulsive moment through which we are living. Climate change  the Palestinian question  the crisis in Libya and investment in development are just a few examples that illustrate its ineffectiveness. Solutions to the great problems of our planet are no longer reached within these walls. The most powerful countries of the world rely on other forums  exclusionary and anti-democratic ones  to decide for everyone else. If we do not act today on those and other urgent themes  such as the reform of the international monetary and economic systems as well as that of certain United Nations bodies  there will be no point in debating ways to restore the role of this world body in global governance. It is up to us to resolve this grave dilemma."
"52",2159,"EGY",66,2011,"I am pleased to congratulate the brotherly State of Qatar and Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser personally on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-six session. I am confident that Mr. Al-Nasser’s wise leadership of the Assembly’s proceedings will help us fulfil our ambitions and aspirations. I also congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on his re-election to his second term as he continues to strive to realize the purposes and principles of the Charter.   53 11-51360   I proudly stand before the Assembly today representing Egypt in a new era and with a new face as it leaves behind a fading era for one whose features are just emerging  and as it embarks on a new phase regarded by all Egyptians as auspicious and full of promise. The Egyptian people came out en masse on 25 January calling for democratic reforms and strengthened respect for human rights  fundamental freedoms and social justice. The Egyptian people wanted to plant the seeds of a brighter future deep in the land of reality  for their sake and for the benefit of their future generations.  The people obtained what they sought. They were able to impose their word and enforce their will. They were backed by the understanding and support of the Egyptian armed forces  which truly exemplify genuine patriotism and unity with the people of our nation. The stance of our armed forces will be remembered by history. It is consistent with their doctrine that they are guardians of the nation  not of a specific political regime  and with an institution that is first and foremost loyal to the people  who for their part rallied around their armed forces and expressed their appreciation.   That ideal situation was made possible by circumstances that can rarely be repeated and that enabled the Egyptians to alter the face of their country in a historic and wonderful way. Egyptians wanted to rapidly catch up with other countries that had made great strides in achieving political pluralism and the alternation of power  in upholding and applying the rule of law  in relentlessly fighting corruption in its various forms  and in providing equal opportunities to their youth to fulfil their ambitions and aspirations to decent lives.  I am addressing the Assembly today as Egypt moves forward  determined to complete the transitional phase that arose from that remarkable transformative change. Over the past few months  and indeed since the revolution took place  Egypt has witnessed a new internal dynamic and a wide national debate involving all segments of society and covering all issues on the national agenda. Foremost on that agenda are the drafting of a new constitution and the organization of the upcoming legislative and presidential elections. Those steps will increase the prospects of success of the transitional phase and launch a sound political process commensurate with the aspirations of the people and Egypt’s unique standing in the region and worldwide. It is a process that will culminate in the handing of power to an elected civilian authority.  Egypt is honoured to have held the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement since July 2009. The start of this session of the General Assembly coincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth year since the first summit of the Movement took place  and to celebrate its significant contributions to enhancing our international efforts to preserve international peace and security and achieve development for the peoples of the world in a changing international environment and in the face of multiple challenges. The commemoration comes after a series of important events organized by the Movement to promote the greater involvement of developing countries in the governance of international institutions and to ensure fair participation in the process of international norms-setting and decision-making in the political  economic and social fields.  On that basis and to that end  the Egyptian chairmanship of the Movement has undertaken numerous activities to strengthen the Movement’s capacity to respond effectively to new and ongoing international changes. The Movement has also played a vital role in coordinating the positions of its member States on various issues on the international agenda  including those related to disarmament  collective security  the reform of the United Nations  and the promotion of international ideals and values of democracy and respect for human rights.  During its chairmanship of the Movement  Egypt has sought to reinforce the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Group of 77 and China. In the light of an international work agenda loaded with issues  ideas and initiatives  we resolved to restore the issue of development in its various dimensions as the top priority of the United Nations  and together we adopted a number of important initiatives in the fields of food security  the empowerment of women and the fight against human trafficking. We will pursue those efforts until we hand over the chairmanship of the Movement in the summer of 2012 to the country chairing it next.  I reiterate here today the support of the Non-Aligned Movement for the historic struggle of the brotherly Palestinian people to regain their legitimate rights  for the efforts made towards declaring the establishment of the independent State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and for its admission as a full Member of the United Nations. I also call on    11-51360 54  the countries that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so as a contribution to the pursuit of a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict based on the two-State solution.  The Non-Aligned Movement believes that there is a pressing need for a comprehensive and substantial reform of the United Nations in order to strengthen its ability to respond positively to international challenges  to meet to the aspirations of peoples  and to address the radical changes that have altered the shape and composition of the international community so that the United Nations may become a true reflection of the realities of today’s world.  Such reform will not be achieved unless the Security Council is reformed and becomes more representative  more transparent and more reflective of the democratic nature of global action. Inevitably  major steps must be taken to end the monopoly of permanent members over the decision-making process in the Council and to put an end to the historical injustice inflicted on Africa as a result of its non-representation in the permanent membership category  as well as its inadequate representation in the non-permanent membership category  despite Member States’ growing support for the African position. In the same context  States members of the Non-Aligned Movement demand that efforts be continued to revitalize the role of the General Assembly and to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council.  The States members of the Non-Aligned Movement also reaffirm the need for the international community to support the work of developing countries to implement their development plans aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals  through an enabling international climate that bolsters efforts to realize comprehensive economic and social development  and the fulfilment by all developed countries of their financing for development commitments. It must also support their efforts to achieve more balanced international economic relations and to establish a fairer international trade system that takes into account the development needs of developing countries.  We feel nothing but deep sorrow every time we realize that  for decades  grave historic injustice has been inflicted on a people while  to date  the entire world has failed to end it. The just question of Palestine endures after two entire decades of fruitless negotiations without the desired settlement. To this day  the Palestinian people remain deprived of their legitimate fundamental rights  including their rights to freedom  independence and to establish their own sovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital.  That is the very State for which the Palestinian President yesterday submitted a request for membership of the United Nations (A/66/371  annex)  after serious and just efforts towards a final settlement had stalled and any chance of achieving significant progress in the negotiating process had dwindled  in particular since the other party insists on keeping the negotiating process open forever. Yesterday  we saw the Quartet fail yet again to come up with a balanced vision to achieve the goal that we all know and approve of  yet differ on how to realize.  It is utterly absurd to carry on talking about a peace process  while Israel continues  in all comfort and complete disregard for the objections of the countries of the world  to construct settlements on the Palestinian territories in the West Bank  altering the features of occupied East Jerusalem  using violence against civilians and continuing its blockade of Gaza  in violation of the provisions of international law.   Regrettably  anyone with a sense of justice following the situation will see in Israel’s actions the embodiment of its continuing refusal to admit that the only way to achieve its security is by reaching a just settlement with the Palestinians through serious negotiations based on clear parameters and terms of reference and a specific time frame. What is urgently needed now is to intensify all our efforts in order to put an end to the conflict.  Egypt has been and will remain committed to the goal of achieving the just and comprehensive peace that it initiated in the Middle East  and will continue to actively support it. Egypt will continue its efforts to end the Israeli occupation of the occupied Palestinian territories and to resolve all final-status issues within a specific  agreed and internationally guaranteed time frame. Egypt will also maintain its efforts to capitalize on the successes achieved in Cairo through the signing of the Palestinian reconciliation agreement  thereby strengthening Palestinian unity and efforts to achieve peace.   55 11-51360   Egypt welcomes the presence of the Republic of South Sudan among us today as a State Member of the United Nations. We hope that that nascent State will play a tangible role in regional stability  and that it will make steady progress on the road to development and institution-building. At the same time  we commend the Sudan for its commitment to implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and to respecting the will of the people of the South for an independent State.   However  even though last year witnessed significant cooperation between the two sides  outstanding issues remain unsettled. They should be resolved within a framework of cooperation and goodwill  which requires the formation of a genuine partnership to examine how to address such issues. It is no secret that the Sudan and South Sudan still look forward to the support of the international community for their development and reconstruction efforts so that the Sudan can achieve stability and development throughout its territory  within the context of its unity and territorial integrity  and so that South Sudan can build its State and institutions. On that basis  I reiterate Egypt’s resolve to continue supporting both countries at all levels.  On behalf of Egypt  I would also like to pay a deserved tribute to the revolution of the sisterly State of Tunisia  which expedited dawn of the Arab Spring. I also express our solidarity with the brotherly people of Libya  and congratulate the National Transitional Council on its assumption of the seat of Libya at the United Nations. I salute its efforts to restore stability and internal peace. I would also like to express Egypt’s readiness to provide any support that may contribute to the country’s reconstruction efforts and help it to get through this critical period.  As for the brotherly State of Yemen  Egypt supports all ongoing efforts to achieve stability and to meet the expectations of its people  in accordance with mechanisms to be agreed by the people of Yemen themselves. If the status quo remains unchanged  that will undoubtedly have grave and negative implications for the security and stability of the region.  Many Egyptians are following with great concern the serious developments in the brotherly State of Syria and the resulting loss of lives and the suffering endured by our brothers and sisters there. Today  I would like to reiterate the position previously expressed by Egypt that the only solution to the crisis in Syria lies in ending the violence and engaging in a serious dialogue among all parties in a climate of political openness.  Meanwhile  I cannot fail to mention the Arab Gulf region today and must emphasize that the security and stability of the brotherly Arab States of the Gulf are of particular strategic importance to Egypt. Given the deep historical  societal  cultural  political and security ties that bond us with our brothers and sisters in those countries  they are granted very high priority and attention in Egypt’s foreign policy. Egypt will always strive to achieve the stability of that vital region of the world.  The issues of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation remain of great importance to Egypt. In cooperation with our international partners  we will continue to urge nuclear States to undertake their responsibilities  as stipulated in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  in order to safeguard the credibility of that legal instrument and its ensuing indivisible principles. Furthermore  Egypt will spare no effort in pursuing the goal of realizing the universality of the NPT  especially in the Middle East  where all countries have acceded to the Treaty  with the exception of Israel  which is thus delaying the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.   That is why Egypt attaches great importance to the implementation of the four action plans adopted at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT  and especially the plan relating to the Middle East and endorsing the holding of a conference on the Middle East next year. In reality  we are concerned that a facilitator has not yet been appointed or a host country selected  even though more than 16 months have elapsed since the Review Conference ended.  In that context  I reiterate Egypt’s firm position that the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy must be linked to full compliance with international commitments under the Treaty  which entails the full cooperation of all Member States with the International Atomic Energy Agency  and avoiding any escalation in order to promote non-proliferation efforts in the region.  Africa has always held a privileged position and unique priority status on the Egyptian foreign policy agenda. Egypt was a consistent and effective partner of the peoples of the continent in their struggle to gain independence in the 1950s and 1960s. This partnership continued during the reconstruction period that    11-51360 56  followed independence. Egypt will increasingly work to activate and deepen its various cooperation mechanisms and frameworks with other African countries and strive to propel them towards a new dawn  thereby contributing to the realization of the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for more development and increased prosperity.  Egypt expects the United Nations to maintain its efforts to support the various components of the African peace and security architecture and to build the institutional capacity of the continent in conflict resolution  peacekeeping  peacebuilding and reconstruction. Those efforts should complement its support for the development aspirations and attempts of the African countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  in the light of the interlinkages between peace  security and development challenges in Africa.  Egypt is following with concern the ever-deteriorating situation in Somalia and calls for concerted regional and international efforts to put an end to the sufferings of the brotherly people of that country and to enable them to achieve peace and success in their capacity-building process. Egypt once again invites external parties to refrain from negatively interfering in the internal affairs of Somalia and to contribute instead to efforts to improve the humanitarian situation and achieve stability.   In this regard  Egypt has effectively contributed to international efforts to address the problem of drought in the Horn of Africa  eradicate hunger and provide food to the affected populations. Egypt also contributes to the fight to exterminate piracy along the coast of Somalia  given the strategic importance of the waters south of the Red and Arabian Seas  especially in relation to Egypt’s national security and to the safety of navigation in the Suez Canal.  The ability of the United Nations to assume its responsibilities depends on our collective will. What is required is resolve based on a robust determination to strengthen our joint international efforts to enable the Organization to deal more effectively with the various international and regional issues and problems that we face. That requires collective hard work to reinforce the principles of democracy within multilateralism and to promote dialogue and understanding as the sole means for achieving our goals  thereby advancing the ideals of humanity and achieving the ambitions of our peoples for freedom  justice  peace and security."
"53",2183,"ERI",66,2011,"Allow me begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly and his country  Qatar  on his election to preside over the Assembly at this session  and by thanking Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and achievements.  We gather at the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly at an important juncture in the history of the world. We meet at a time of exciting possibilities and opportunities for the betterment of hundreds of millions of people. Yet  these favourable prospects must be weighed against the profound dangers and sense of anxiety that currently grip our world. The persistent economic and financial crisis  massive unemployment  growing inequality between and within nations  spiralling levels of debt  recurrent famines and starvation  high levels of mortality from easily preventable diseases and an increasingly fragile environment are wreaking havoc on the lives of people and the future of nations. Despite the end of the Cold War and the premature declaration of the emergence of a new world order  wars and military interventions continue — almost invariably failing to resolve  and further complicating  the problems they set out to solve.  It is true that none of these problems are new  yet there is no denying that the malaise seems much more intractable today. Three years ago  the world was infused by a renewed spirit of hope and possibility with the historic election of President Barack Obama and the freshness of his message of positive change. However  in spite his best efforts  the strength of his personality and his many talents  that hope has not been realized. The reality is that the problems we face are systemic  were accumulated over many years and decades  and require systemic and structural change. Effecting this real  positive and durable transformation requires not only the effort of one leader and one nation and its allies  but the concerted effort of all nations. We look towards the emerging and re-emerging Powers — China  India  Russia  Brazil and others — to show more leadership and to shoulder bigger responsibilities. We also believe that all nations  whatever their size  can and should play an increasingly bigger and effective role in the endeavour to build a fair  just  equitable and sustainable world.  This year has seen stirring and courageous initiatives taken by the people of many nations to effect fundamental changes that would lead to a new and dignified beginning for them and their countries. While the epicentre of the movement has been in North Africa and the Middle East  it is not limited to the Arab world or to developing nations. In much of the developed world  there is now the same sense of anger and frustration  the same discontent with Governments that have become beholden to a small minority with special interests and the same yearning for decent jobs  meaningful political participation and dignified lives. These realities cannot  and should not  be denied. Clearly  this is not the time for complacency or arrogance. What is required today is a frank acknowledgement of the stark global reality we face  and the readiness to empower our peoples and our youth and to work cooperatively for a secure and brighter future for all.  As we ponder the future and take stock of the sweeping changes that are under way  we cannot fail to   13 11-51191  underscore that the United Nations has already become hopelessly outdated and risks becoming totally irrelevant. We all profess agreement on the need to transform the institutions and procedures of the United Nations  but we remain paralysed  with no prospects for early progress.   Eritrea firmly associates itself with those who stress the urgency of real reform and believes that what is required is not a mere tweaking of the system but a comprehensive transformation of the institution. The critical element of this transformation has to be the strengthening of the authority and role of the General Assembly. As long as this paramount body is deprived of real decision-making powers  the United Nations will remain unrepresentative of the nations of the world  even if the size and composition of the Security Council changes significantly. Similarly  there can be no meaningful revitalization without overhauling the methods of work and procedures of the United Nations  respecting the rights of Member States and ensuring transparency and accountability in all bodies of the Organization.  Half a century has elapsed since the heyday of the era of decolonization that led to the emergence of independent African nations. In spite the hope and enthusiasm of the early years and the achievements registered since  the past five decades have been largely disappointing. The trying times and the internal and external challenges that caused them are certainly not over  as Africa continues to struggle in a difficult and complex international environment. Yet  without exaggerating the possibilities or underestimating the difficulties  it is clear that a number of African countries are entering a period of political  economic and social renewal. They are convinced that Africa has the human and natural resources to succeed. It will not shun international partnerships but will give primacy to its own capabilities and to cooperation at the continental and subregional levels. It is this perspective that is spurring African countries to focus on the key requirements of developing the continent’s infrastructure and promoting trade and economic links among themselves. Another key component is the revitalization of the African Union and subregional organizations.  At the subregional level  Eritrea is committed to economic development and integration in the wider Horn of Africa and Red Sea regions. We are convinced that no country can succeed in a turbulent environment. We will work for the revitalization of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and strive to make it effective in promoting economic development and integration.   We welcome an independent South Sudan and will work with both the Sudan and South Sudan  with whom we have long-standing ties  as they grapple with their domestic situations and endeavour to build cooperative relations.   On Somalia  it has now become abundantly clear that there is a need for a new approach  as the current one has exhausted itself and can only lead to further complications. Given that the central objective remains the reconstitution of Somalia and the rebuilding of effective institutions  it is imperative to seriously engage and bring into a Somali-owned political process all stakeholders  including the Governments of Somaliland and Puntland.  With regard to the Middle East  which is a key item on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly  Eritrea reaffirms its long-standing support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and an independent  sovereign State. It also upholds the right of Israel to live in peace and security within internationally recognized boundaries. At the same time  Eritrea is genuinely concerned that the current drive for United Nations membership for Palestine does not become a symbolic battle bereft of real substance. It is only prudent and relevant to recall that with the exception of a few realistic voices  the Oslo Accords were greeted with much acclaim and that  almost two decades later  they have not led to either Palestinian Statehood or peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.  Finally  I would be remiss in my duty if I did not remind the United Nations of its responsibility to uphold its Charter  international law and numerous Security Council resolutions and take urgent action to end Ethiopia’s occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. Coupled with the lifting of the illegal sanctions on Eritrea  that would not only serve the cause of justice  but it would enable the people of the region to work together to further their collective interests and consolidate Africa’s place in the world."
"54",2229,"ESP",66,2011,"I begin by congratulating the President on his election to preside over this principal organ in which we all strive to achieve the purposes of the United Nations.  I also wish the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the greatest possible success in carrying out his mission of promoting peace and progress around the world with the same effectiveness as he demonstrated throughout his first mandate.  I also warmly congratulate the representatives of the new State of South Sudan  which has joined the United Nations family during the current session.  The economic and financial crisis continues to be a cause of serious concern for the entire world; its consequences are seen in many different fields. The capacity of the international community to take action to address any type of crisis  and to do so in a timely manner  is limited. This restrains the fight against poverty and puts at risk the implementation of sustainable development policies  which are needed now more than ever.  Spain  together with its European Union partners  is taking difficult decisions in order to tackle the crisis. However  beyond the actions taken at the regional and national levels  it is essential to undertake a    11-51378 12  coordinated global response. The United Nations system is an important part of the solution to the crisis.  Women’s equality is a fundamental human right  based upon the concept of equality among all human beings. Advancing women’s full and equal access to the labour market  as well as to the political and social world  is not only ethically imperative  but an essential measure to overcome the crisis.  Since 1 January  the United Nations has been able to count on an instrument to assist Member States to achieve that goal: UN-Women. Its Executive Director  Ms. Michelle Bachelet  will boost this effort. I assure her of Spain’s full support. We will be at the side of all women who fight for freedom and equality.  Over the past few months we have witnessed episodes of rebellion in which peoples have fought against the tyranny of rulers who denied basic human rights  as well as the dignity and value of human beings  preventing people from participating in their countries’ political life and from making use of their resources and opportunities.  We celebrate the success of the popular movements in Tunisia and Egypt and we join the efforts of the international community to support and strengthen the political transition processes in both countries  led by their own peoples.  The Libyan people will also be able to enjoy freedom and live in democracy after decades of dictatorship and months of conflict. We have welcomed the Libyan representatives in the General Assembly  with the satisfaction of knowing that the United Nations  by implementing its principles  has remained at the side of the Libyan people.  We now have the obligation to continue to help the Libyan people in the reconciliation and reconstruction processes. We are ready to do so  and we will do it under the guidance of the United Nations  following the pace set by the Libyans themselves.  Unfortunately  the international community continues to witness with indignation the brutal repression of civilian demonstrators by the Syrian authorities. I firmly condemn those actions once again  and reiterate the need for the international community to take measures to stop the repression.  The Tunisian  Egyptian and Libyan revolutions  the Syrian uprising and the acceleration of the reform processes in Morocco and Jordan are part of a profound transformation of the Arab world  with significant consequences for the region and for the international community as a whole. The legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to enjoy freedom cannot be left out of this wave of change.  The Arab-Israeli conflict has been with the United Nations almost since the Organization’s founding. This session may be remembered as the one in which the General Assembly granted Palestine the status of observer State. Spain could support such a decision  for a number of reasons.  First  the international community recognizes that a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict requires the existence of two States  Israeli and Palestinian  living side by side in peace and security.  Secondly  after more than 60 years of conflict  the international community should send a clear signal to the Palestinians underlining that its commitment in favour of the creation of the Palestinian State is deep and unambiguous.  Thirdly  in the year in which the Arab Spring changed realities in the Arab world — and  indeed  in the world at large — the just  legitimate and long-standing aspiration of the Palestinians to live in dignity in their own State  free from occupation and its accompanying suffering  deserves a clear response from the international community  a response that can no longer be postponed.  This new step could be conceived as a stage towards the legitimate objective of Palestine’s becoming a Member State of the United Nations with full rights.  Effective  sustainable peace can only be achieved through negotiations between the parties. Spain believes that the Palestinians could find in this new status a stimulus for the prompt resumption of negotiations. Precisely because that is the shared goal of the parties and the international community  such a situation should not be used for actions incompatible with the spirit of negotiations. Israel should also contribute to this spirit by refraining from measures that prejudge the final status.  Spain is coordinating its position with its European Union partners. I am grateful for the efforts of the High Representative  Catherine Ashton  to reactivate the negotiations  in a way acceptable to all   13 11-51378  European Union member States  and the declaration of the Quartet  which Spain assesses very positively.  Spain’s engagement with the Palestinian people and their struggle against occupation is long-standing and known to everyone. Spain has always given political  economic and moral support to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians.  On the other hand  the historical relations between Spain and the Jewish people date back many centuries. Spain’s historical identity cannot be understood without its Arab and Jewish heritage.  I wish to underscore Spain’s commitment to Israel with regard to the endeavour to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Since its founding  Israel has experienced a number of wars and has suffered from terrorism against its civilian population. For Spain  the security of this young State born out of an ancient people is essential.   The best way to preserve that State is through a peace treaty that  among other things  provides for the establishment of a Palestinian State along the 1967 lines  with agreed swaps and with Jerusalem as a shared capital. The security of Israel and Palestine will require effective guarantees in the future peace agreement  including possible international participation  should the parties request it.  The future peace agreement should look to the future  turning its back on the painful years of conflict. Therefore  Israel and Palestine have to be certain that claims originating from the conflict will be overcome with their signature of the peace agreement.   In addition  the solution to the painful tragedy of the Palestinian refugees must be a just one agreed by all the parties concerned  while allowing the preservation of Israel’s current character. The Palestinian State will be  in this regard as well  a key element for the final resolution of the conflict.  Some voices have raised concerns that the new democracies may be home to political groups with radical or extremist ideologies. Democracy is an open and fair system of political participation that must also be able to defend itself against possible threats.  Fortunately  we can count on instruments that may contribute to preventing such situations. The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations  which promotes intercultural dialogue and cooperation  is a clear example. The Regional Strategy for the Mediterranean  developed within the Alliance framework  may help  through youth programmes and campaigns to raise awareness  to diffuse democratic values and respect for human rights  always in coexistence with those of local cultures.  We have to prevent Al-Qaida’s terrorism from being reinforced in the Sahel region through the release of uncontrolled weapons. The international community must be united in the fight against this curse that represents a scourge to countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan  in the same irrational and cruel way as that in which it struck New York  Bali  Madrid  London  Mumbai  Moscow and many other places over the past decade.   The United Nations itself recently suffered the consequences of a terrible terrorist attack in Abuja  adding to those previously endured in Baghdad and Algiers  among others. Once again  I extend our condolences to the Secretary-General  and express our solidarity with the victims and their families  as well as with the hard-working members of staff of the United Nations.  The tenth anniversary of the attack on the Twin Towers in the city of New York took place a few days ago. We have lived through a bloody decade since the attack  in spite of the determined fight of the international community against terrorism.   I firmly believe in  and reaffirm  the need to strengthen international cooperation in order to prevent and fight terrorism. Every country must assume the obligation to address this universal scourge. That is why Spain joined  from the beginning  the initiative regarding the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The Forum was launched just a few days ago.   We firmly support United Nations initiatives within the framework of its Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  as well as the efforts of the Security Council and of the Secretariat to rationalize the existing structures in order to reach the goals that we have set in this area.  Spain is especially sensitive with regard to the victims of terrorism. Unfairly forgotten at times  they cannot be mentioned only as a rhetoric tool. Rather  there should be an effective commitment to give them recognition  remember them and provide them the assistance and support that they deserve. That is how    11-51378 14  we have understood the position of victims in Spain  and we have passed legislation on the issue  giving us one of the most advanced and efficient models in the world in assisting the victims of terrorism.  Spain follows very closely the dynamism of a region with strong links with Spain — Latin America. The strength of the Latin American economy is essential to overcome the crisis and to create a new international economic governance.  That is why enhancing and consolidating a broad dialogue with Latin America is crucial. The dialogue should include the big issues on the global agenda  such as the design of an ambitious and innovative international financial architecture  as well as the response to climate change  energy  security and migration.  Latin America’s regional integration has been an engine fuelling its growth and improving understanding. Spain has always wished to support this process in the framework of the Ibero-American Summits.  Other regions of the world also deserve special attention because of the tragic situations of their populations as a result of drought and other endemic problems.   The situation in the Horn of Africa is intolerable. We are contributing to alleviating the famine in Somalia  in coordination with other donors and United Nations agencies. However  humanitarian aid  despite being a priority  is only a first step towards development. We still have a long way to go in many parts of the world.  I therefore reaffirm Spain’s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. The fight against poverty is a fundamental objective of my country’s aid and cooperation for development policy. The challenge of the Millennium Development Goals should encourage us to redouble our efforts to achieve them within the deadline that has been set.  However  in order to realize the Goals and to provide a future for generations to come  we must make the most of meetings such as the one to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012  where the intention is to forge a new paradigm that should allow us to combine the Millennium Development Goals with environmental sustainability.  It is also important to take advantage of the momentum created by the Cancún Conference in 2010 on the climate change negotiating process. We will continue to contribute to the process constructively  together with our European Union partners  at the upcoming Durban Conference.  The financial crisis affecting the global economy cannot be an excuse to avoid our commitments. On the contrary  it should encourage us to fulfil them. That is why Spain believes in supporting the development of innovative financing instruments — in other words  the development of mechanisms through which to mobilize mid-term and long-term additional financial resources. That should be done in a way that is stable and predictable  as well as being complementary to official development aid  which should be maintained  come what may. Spain currently chairs the leading Pilot Group on innovative financing for development  of which we have great hopes.  Spain’s support for  and participation in  the activities of the Organization relating to the maintenance of peace and security in diverse parts of the world also demonstrates our commitment to the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations. Almost 1 200 Spaniards actively participate today in United Nations peacekeeping operations  with an especially prominent presence in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  a mission essential to maintaining stability in the south of the country  as well as to helping its economic development.  I thank the Secretary-General for participating in the inauguration of the United Nations base in Quart de Poblet  Valencia  thus recognizing Spain’s commitment to the United Nations. The construction of the base  which Spain provided to the United Nations  will  as the Secretary-General said  facilitate the work of the Organization  enhance the reliability of its communications and considerably improve the safety and security of staff in the field.  Spain is very proud of its participation in United Nations operations. We intend to maintain a firm  active  permanent commitment to the Organization and its purposes. In line with that commitment  Spain announced in 2005 its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the biennium 2015-2016. We hope that  with the support of Member States  we shall have a seat on the Council and in that position continue working for the preservation of   15 11-51378  international security and stability. At the same time  we will strive to promote development and human rights as fundamental pillars of lasting peace.  A year ago  Libyan  Egyptian and Tunisian men and women witnessed the Assembly meeting while they were still under the oppression of dictatorial regimes. Today they own their future. They have fought for it. The international community has protected and supported them. They  on their part  have given us hope. We can now hope that change is possible. There is no insurmountable challenge.  We are today certain that the international community  guided by the United Nations  is on the path of peace and freedom."
"55",2255,"EST",66,2011,"I would first of all like to congratulate Ambassador Al-Nasser on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly.   The twentieth anniversary this year of the restoration of Estonia’s independence  not surprisingly  coincides with our twentieth year of membership in the United Nations and our participation in the General Assembly. Given where we were then  in 1991 — a poor and beleaguered country  brutalized by a half-century of thuggish Soviet  then Nazi  and then again Soviet occupation — our transformation in one generation to a modern  technologically cutting-edge European democracy is a testament to what a committed people can do. It is  as well  a challenge to those who find excuses for not implementing   47 11-50692  democracy  for not eliminating corruption and for continuing to brutalize their citizens.  Today  20 years after the bumbling coup and ensuing crumbling of that rusty edifice of totalitarianism  the Soviet Union  we again smell in the air the hope of liberty and democracy — this time in the Middle East and North Africa. Again people have come together and said  “Enough!” — of the lies  the corruption and the 3 a.m. knock on the door by the dull-brained goons of the secret police. People want to be able to speak their minds and to run their own lives  free of harassment  or worse  by the authorities. In a word  people want democracy. They want  too  the foundations of democracy: respect for human rights  the rule of law and the freedom of speech and assembly.  With those hopes in the hearts of so many people in this year of otherwise dismal and tawdry news  Estonia welcomes — indeed wholeheartedly encourages — the United Nations to move forward on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s decision to focus during his second term on democracy and human rights. Estonia welcomes that decision because  frankly  the results of the democracy movements of a generation ago have not even come close to what we hoped for at the time. Most of the people who lived under undemocratic rule two decades ago continue to do so today. Of what was the Soviet Union then  only Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania have earned the designation “free” in Freedom House’s annual report card on the rule of law  respect for fundamental freedoms and free and fair elections. That  I submit  is a poor result.  Each country and each situation is of course different. No textbook rules can tell us how to make democracy work or how to build a prosperous society. A few basic tenets and lessons  however  hold across nations  experiences and cultures. The United Nations own Universal Declaration of Human Rights — a document everyone here is obliged to adhere to — after all  is based on the premise of common truths held by all.  Democracy  as I said  is not only about voting and free and fair elections  vital though they are for any free and democratic society. Respect for human rights and the rule of law constitute the cornerstones of an open society. If one cannot speak their mind or be guaranteed a fair trial if arrested  it matters little that they can go to the polling booth. Rights and freedoms belong to each and every person. They are not the privilege of a select few with the money  the guns or the power.  For Estonia  it is of fundamental importance that the North African and Middle Eastern revolutions have been popular reactions to sustained violations of human rights  corruption and injustice. The revolutions confirm the universal aspiration to realize one’s human rights. They show once again  as throughout history  that people naturally want to be free from fear and repression. Notice I said people  not “men”. As long ago as 2 500 years ago  Aristotle noted that where “the state of women is bad  almost half of human life is spoilt”. This is no less true today and will remain so. The ongoing revolutions could not have occurred and cannot succeed without women.   It is a profound source of concern to Estonia to notice that  while women are welcome to protest against corrupt regimes  they are not always welcome to participate in the political process. Estonia therefore places great hopes on the United Nations new gender entity  UN-Women  and will continue to insist that the United Nations as a whole do its part globally by standing up for women’s rights. We also expect that UN-Women will play an active role in helping to take the principles of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security from paper to reality.  For as long as we have lived as a free nation  Estonia has always protected and promoted human rights and fundamental freedoms at home and abroad. Our candidature to the Human Rights Council is a logical consequence of our work  but it is certainly not the culmination as we continue to live up to our national and international obligations.  Once again  ongoing events underline the need for us to focus on the protection of civilians from atrocities. Even in the democratic part of my continent  the political project we today call the European Union was a reaction to mass murder and war. The very history of Europe motivates us to take preventive steps to avoid any repetition of such crimes. Therefore  it is vital that we develop common practices and the capacity to implement the principle of the responsibility to protect. Protecting civilians from atrocities  dear colleagues  is not just about protection.    11-50692 48  It also means bringing the perpetrators of crimes and atrocities against civilians to justice.   International law  in particular the International Criminal Court  and the understanding that justice will be done  no matter how long it takes  are the tools we possess to prevent the worst human rights violations. The rule of law and respect for international law are what will help ravaged and victimized societies to regain their dignity and rebuild their communities. The common efforts of the international community  the International Criminal Court and its States parties remain a priority for my country.  While focusing on the pertinent issues of the present  we must not shy away from addressing the unresolved issues of the recent past. Afghanistan is one of those. Establishing lasting security there remains a key objective for Estonia. To reach that objective  we must focus on assisting Afghan efforts to further develop good governance and the rule of law. Along with human rights  these are the crucial elements of a sustainable society. We believe that we must all remain committed as long as is necessary to reach this goal. To that end  Estonia will continue to support the access of Afghans  in particular women and children  to health care and education through its development cooperation projects.  Georgia is another country that continues to require our attention. The 2008 war ended with the violation of Georgian territorial integrity  which is a fundamental violation of international law that remains unresolved to this day. The fundamental principles of international law must be followed by all members of the international community and not just the small  who have no other recourse. Additionally  we should continue to support the Geneva talks. The United Nations involvement is of the utmost importance and must continue in the future.  Here today in the United Nations  our attention is also focused on Israel and Palestine. A viable two-State solution must take into consideration the legitimate concerns of both sides for their well-being  safety and prosperity.  Another security- and human rights-related topic is the Internet  especially these days  when it has come to play such an important role in democratization by enabling political discussion and mobilizing popular movements. The Internet has grown beyond all expectations since people began to use it regularly some 20 years ago. Its global  ipso facto cross-border nature allows users the world over to access information and ideas  to communicate with each other and to learn. Estonia firmly believes that States should ensure that their people can freely seek  receive and impart information and ideas and have access to the Internet. In fact  Estonia believes that  in this technological age  unimpeded access to the Internet is a human right.  A transparent Government and administration  a liberal economic environment and a strong educational system all have contributed to Estonia’s success. Estonia’s development over the past 20 years is proof that information and communications technology can be a springboard to success for all States. We are quite willing to continue to share our experience  especially in increasing transparency and openness in Government  with other countries.  The Internet  however  poses many dangers as well. Increasingly disruptive cyberthreats and attacks that can seriously harm entire communities and  indeed  cause harm to countless individuals  are a new danger that we face. The large-scale cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 created a new awareness among our people. The steps Estonia has taken towards a more secure Internet  however  do not restrict our people’s freedoms. In fact  Freedom House’s global assessment of Freedom on the Net 2011 rated Estonia as the freest in the world  demonstrating that a proper balance between rights and security can be found without compromising either.  We also bear responsibility for the environment we live in. It was no accident that the democratic revolutions of Central and Eastern Europe were accompanied  and indeed often instigated  by environmental movements. Citizens had become fed up with the totalitarian system’s abuse of nature and disregard for human beings. Ignoring the state of its citizens’ health and surroundings  the totalitarian State exposed itself to be what it was — a self-serving clique hell-bent on maintaining its power  no matter what the cost to its people  no matter what pain and suffering ensued.  Today  the challenge we face is global. It is climate change. Estonia’s 2010 national security concept states that climate change is also a security issue and can have a destabilizing effect. Estonia already has decided to contribute to the fast-track   49 11-50692  financing of efforts to combat climate change. We believe that sustainable development and the green economy need a global approach  as exemplified by preparations for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development next year.   One already evident consequence of climate change is an increase in the number of people who need clean water and food. Estonia will continue to increase its contribution to the United Nations humanitarian system.  While the world’s humanitarian needs grow  we require increased coordination and strict scrutiny of the real needs of aid recipients. As donor Governments  we are doubly accountable  first to those who require assistance; but we are also accountable to our taxpayers for the effective use of every Euro cent. If our taxpayers believe that Government is spending tax money unwisely or ineffectively  they will vote for a Government that cares less for foreign assistance expenditures. In these days of ever greater financial difficulty in donor countries themselves  this is not an observation to be ignored.  The many times I have addressed the General Assembly  I have deliberated on the nature of the United Nations and the need for reform. The United Nations needs to change as the world around us changes. System-wide coherence  delivering as one  and revitalization of the General Assembly are steps in the right direction.   We welcome these changes  yet at the same time Estonia sincerely hopes that the same spirit will prevail in reform of the Security Council. If nations are not given a fair and equitable voice  proportional and appropriate to its role in today’s world — not the world of 1945 — we will find that the Organization has ever less credibility. I propose that we adopt a new attitude of openness to new developments in order to make sure that the United Nations as a whole can better deliver on the undoubtedly important issues for which it is responsible.  In conclusion  let me say that history did not end 20 years ago with the re-emergence of democratic nations in Central and Eastern Europe. Nor will history end with the Arab Spring. Democracy  freedom  human rights  the rule of law and sustainable development all require constant and consistent support and protection.  The world faces challenges  new and old. We face them daily. Today  as we commemorate the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack ten years ago here in New York  we recognize how much the world has changed since the United Nations was founded 66 years ago. We must address and act upon these new challenges. It is we  the United Nations  who need to keep pace with changes and developments in the world we live in to protect and promote universal values across the globe."
"56",2301,"ETH",66,2011,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in successfully discharging his high responsibilities. I would also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor for his excellent stewardship of the Assembly’s previous session. And allow me to take this opportunity to once again congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second term  and to express our admiration for work well done during his first term.  It is with a great sense of brotherhood that I warmly welcome the Republic of South Sudan to the family of our global Organization and offer our sincere congratulations and best wishes to the newest Member State. We also welcome the Libyan delegation  which we recognized some time ago. We are not oblivious to the Herculean challenge that they face.  The globalizing world has always presented challenges to Africa and the developing world. However  the negative developments over the past few years  which appear to be far from being mitigated  have made it even more difficult for countries such as ours to move ahead on the path to development as fast as we would have liked and our potential and commitment would have allowed. There is a need for a redoubled effort so that the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals are not frustrated. That was also the hope of the fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. For our part  we feel that we have been on track for almost all the targets  and our commitment is to be even more ambitious  in line with our five-year Growth and Transformation Plan. Nevertheless  the global economic situation is a source of concern.   37 11-51384   Within that global context  the Horn of Africa has been hit by the worst adverse climatic conditions in 60 years  causing a very tragic drought situation. At this critical juncture  the international community should be galvanized  particularly in helping to alleviate the crisis in Somalia. The call made on Saturday at the mini-summit on that issue needs to be reiterated and amplified. We should do more for the people of Somalia and those others in the region who have been affected by the calamity.  Even more crucial in the Horn of Africa is sustainable development. Our youth need to have their hopes for the future not frustrated  and the condition of our women and children requires much greater attention. On top of denying people their human rights  poverty is not a solid foundation on which peace and security can be built. That need compels us to draw attention to a number of challenges that we  in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region  face  particularly with respect to climate change. The adverse consequences of climate change are becoming evident in various ways. The challenges are global  requiring global solutions  on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility. We do not believe that enough is being done commensurate with the gravity of the threat to humanity in general. Moreover  the whole issue embodies injustice because Africa and the developing world happen to be the worst affected  while contributing the least to climate change.  As members of IGAD  we have for some time tried to bring our collective effort to bear on the various challenges the Horn of Africa faces. Realizing the fact that one of the major factors hindering development in our region is related to security and the lack of durable stability  apart from doing our best to lay the basis for the integration of our subregion through various infrastructure-related projects  we have continued to strengthen our common endeavour for peace and security in the IGAD region.   The positive outcomes are there to be seen. No regional group has been as closely identified with peacemaking in the Sudan as IGAD. In Somalia  in close collaboration with the East African Community  the African Union and the United Nations  IGAD has been the lynchpin in the effort to assist the people of Somalia in achieving peace  stability and national reconciliation. Now  with the extremists and Al-Shabaab having been driven out of Mogadishu and the tide turning against them  there is new hope in Somalia  which should be sustained. The Kampala Accord laid the basis for a breakthrough in Somalia  for which we owe gratitude to President Yoweri Museveni and Ambassador Mahiga  Special Representative of the Secretary-General.  Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to Uganda and Burundi for the sacrifices that they have made  and continue to make  as the two countries that spearheaded the efforts of the African Union Mission and the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to keep those such as Al-Shabaab and their supporters at bay. It must be underlined that it is a fight that has humanitarian and development implications  not only security or political. That is why the successful cooperation of the IGAD countries for stability and security in the Horn of Africa  and in the fight against terrorism and extremism  has been so vital. It requires the wholehearted support of the international community  the General Assembly and  most particularly  the Security Council.  I need not go into the details of what the IGAD countries have requested of the Security Council in terms of support for them to succeed in the effort that they are making for peace in Somalia and to contain those who not only encourage  but also take part in carrying out terrorism. It is particularly vital for the Council to act on the conclusions and recommendations of a body established by the Council itself. Sweet talk  devoid of any behavioural change in practice and on the ground  should not lead the Security Council to wish away concrete evidence presented to it by a committee of its own creation.  Let us admit that there are double standards in the fight against terrorism. Our counter-terrorism effort cannot succeed if we are selective in that struggle. The Prime Minister of India could not have been more correct when he said from this rostrum last Saturday:   “There cannot be selective approaches in dealing with terrorist groups or the infrastructure of terrorism. Terrorism has to be fought across all fronts.” ()  We in Ethiopia have never had a short-sighted perspective on what we need to do to ensure that our national interest and our national security are protected. In this day and age  it is only through collective effort that we can ensure peace  security and stability. Some might imagine that they would benefit    11-51384 38  by encouraging discord in their neighbourhood. The Horn of Africa has suffered because of policies emanating from that kind of mindset for too long. That should be combated. We seek the support of all fair-minded people in that endeavour.   For our part  we have been guided by the objective of protecting and defending the collective security interest of the people of our region. That has guided our policy in the Sudan and in the effort that we have been making to nurture mutual confidence between us and both the Republic of Sudan and the new nation of South Sudan. We have also followed that signpost in conducting our policy with respect to Somalia.  Ethiopia is not a newcomer to international diplomacy. As a founding member of the United Nations  we take our responsibility as members of the human family seriously. We view our vocation to be a factor for strengthening international peace and security and for enhancing friendly relations among nations  large or small  on the basis of full equality. That is why  as we continue to call for the reform of the Security Council  we also remain committed to the revitalization of the General Assembly  the true representative of the people of the world in the true spirit of the United Nations Charter  whose very first phrase is: “We the peoples of the United Nations”.  In that same spirit  Ethiopia wants to express its position on the historic turning point that the people of Palestine and the people of Israel are passing through and the challenges that they are facing. We are convinced that no great wisdom is required to realize that  at the end of the day  it is only through peaceful negotiation and mutual accommodation that the two parties can reach the final destination.   In that regard  it is not enough that the right of the Palestinians to a viable State of their own be acknowledged and be paid lip service. It is also necessary that real  tangible and practical steps be taken  and in good time  towards the realization of that objective. That has not been done. No doubt  that is partly the explanation for where we are today and at this moment. On the other hand  while it is self-defeating  and also unjust  to use it as a pretext for delaying the realization of the dreams of the people of Palestine  nonetheless  it is neither proper nor realistic to underestimate and belittle the security concerns of Israel.   When the time comes for us to pronounce ourselves on this signature issue of the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly  the position we take will be based on our objective assessment of all dimensions of the issue in good faith and in line with what we believe is dictated by the cause of justice and sustainable peace.  We are passing through a period not only of uncertainty  but also of great historic and momentous change. The world that emerged from the Second World War is almost no more. Periods such as this need to be handled delicately. That is why it is so critical that more attention be paid to the need for preventing conflicts and for mediation. We are pleased that the President Al-Nasser has made this one of his top priorities. We want to assure him that he can expect the full cooperation of the IGAD countries.   Let me conclude by asking for the support of all Member States for the draft resolution that the IGAD countries will be submitting requesting observer status for IGAD at the United Nations."
"57",2347,"FIN",66,2011,"Let me start by congratulating both the President and the Secretary-General on their elections.   We live in an era of integration and interconnection. No country can solve all the challenges it faces on its own. Every country should be part of the solution. Common responses are needed more than ever. Accordingly  the importance of the United Nations has grown.   The United Nations  or as I like to call it — the G-193 — has been a success story. The guiding principles of the United Nations Charter — peace and security  human rights and development — have served us well for decades.   The Millennium Development Goals are more recent examples of the global reach of the United Nations. These Goals have inspired Governments to introduce measures that are saving lives every single day.   The United Nations has also been at the forefront of support for the empowerment of women. The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women gives women and girls an even stronger and more unified voice. I have truly enjoyed hearing so many speakers today underlining that important trend.   Globalization has contributed to substantial economic growth. However  fruits of that growth have not been equally distributed between and within nations. That is wrong  and it is not sustainable. It is our duty to provide a sustainable future for our planet and its people. Sustainability  in brief  is about a resilient planet that supports the needs of all people worldwide.   We  the world community  have accomplished a lot since we adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development Goals 11 years ago. Both of them have proved to be effective tools in the eradication of extreme poverty.   But the work must continue with enhanced determination. We must respect the interdependence of the three dimensions of sustainable development — the social  economic and ecological. If even one of these dimensions is neglected  development cannot be sustainable.   Recent events in Northern Africa and the Middle East have once again emphasized that development  human rights and peace and security are interlinked. Everyone must be able to enjoy civil and political as well as economic  social and cultural rights.  I am pleased to chair the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability together with President Zuma of South Africa. We will deliver our recommendations towards the end of this year. The goal of the Panel is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality  make growth inclusive  and production and consumption more sustainable  while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries. We are fully convinced that the eradication of poverty and sustainable development are interlinked and can be reached together. It is really one fight.  The Panel is building bridges between economy  ecology and social justice. The empowerment of women and youth is vital for our goal. It is necessary to put into use all human resources for the development of our societies.  We have not only discussed setting the goals but also how to reach them. I believe that expanding    11-50692 40  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into sustainable development goals around the year 2015 could help the world community to continue its fight against poverty and enhance sustainable development.  In today’s world  there are far too many conflicts. As they often take place within countries  they are especially dangerous for civilians. These asymmetrical conflicts usually arise from injustice  violations of human rights and discrimination against minorities.   The President has chosen a very important theme for the general debate  namely mediation. The peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and mediation are at the very heart of the United Nations. Mediation has to be used at every stage of conflict. We need to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations in this field. Training and guidance are pivotal. Women’s participation and grass-roots activities and the work of non-governmental organizations are also vital for our efforts if we want to win.  On the initiative of Finland and Turkey  the General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on mediation in June of this year (resolution 65/283). As has been mentioned today  this is the very first resolution on this theme in the history of the United Nations. The resolution aims at strengthening the role of the United Nations in mediation. I would like to thank the Member States for their excellent support to this process. Let us continue our common efforts also during the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are ready for that.  Peace processes need to be more inclusive. I wish to stress the importance of the full and effective participation of women in all stages of peace processes. The record is far from impressive at the moment  as the number of women around the negotiation tables continues to be strikingly low. I welcome the efforts by UN-Women to change the situation  and I call upon us all to make a commitment to involve more women in this work.  Finland  my own country  is a strong supporter of the United Nations  in word and deed. We contribute more than our share to peacekeeping  to development aid and to the promotion of human rights around the world. Finland wishes to continue to carry its responsibilities  with the Assembly’s support  in the Security Council for the term 2013-2014. Our commitment  our capacity to serve on the Council and our record speak for us.  Finland warmly welcomes the Republic of South Sudan as the 193rd Member State of the United Nations. The implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement has been a testimony to the importance of mediation and regional leadership. I commend the efforts of President Mbeki and his Panel to find solutions to outstanding issues between the Sudan and South Sudan.  The dramatic and rapidly evolving situation in the Arab world has been at the centre of the attention of the international community. Women and men have marched together for a better future. It is important that they continue to participate side by side in also building a democratic society. Democracy cannot be achieved without full participation of women too.  As we welcome the new Libya into the world community  Finland commends the National Transitional Council for underlining the need to continue building a sense of national unity  reconciliation and an inclusive political system with respect for equal civil rights and freedom of expression. Finland gives its full support to the transition  reflecting the aspirations of Libyan people. We are ready to support the building of democratic society based on the rule of law and respect for human rights  including the fulfilment of the human rights of women. The United Nations should play a central role in coordinating the international community’s contribution. We very much welcome the United Nations Support Mission in Libya.  Reaching a solution to the Middle East conflict is more pressing than ever. The Palestinians have a right to their own State  Palestine. The international community gathered here in the General Assembly must show that it is united in its message to the parties. We need the urgent resumption of negotiations that will lead  within an agreed on time frame  to a two-State solution  with the State of Israel and an independent  democratic  contiguous and viable State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security. There is no time to waste.  I have had an opportunity to lead Finland’s delegation to the General Assembly since 1995. We have witnessed a remarkable widening of our common global agenda. Today’s decisions will affect not only us but also future generations. Change is necessary for the survival of humankind. I am confident that the United   41 11-50692  Nations is the sole universal forum to respond to the challenges that the world is facing.  I wish those gathered here all the best for the future."
"58",2391,"FJI",66,2011,"I bring warm greetings to all from the Government and people of Fiji. May I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss.  This year  it was my honour to open new missions in Indonesia and South Africa. The Fiji High Commission in Pretoria is our first diplomatic mission on the continent of Africa  and we see it as a gateway to that great continent. Our new embassy in Jakarta is intended to strengthen our warm  fraternal relations with Indonesia. In the same spirit  I journey next week to Brazil to open Fiji’s first embassy on the South American continent.   In May this year Fiji had the privilege of being admitted to membership of the Non-Aligned Movement. We have pledged to play our full part in the Movement’s activities  particularly in the area of South-South cooperation and sustainable development. These positive developments complement the Fijian Government’s Look North Policy and our intention to expand relations with non-traditional partners. We believe that such an expansion of outlook is essential to our national development and our full exercise of Fiji’s global rights and responsibilities. Here at the United Nations  we are active members of the Asia-Pacific Group and  along with our fellow Pacific small island developing States  we greatly appreciate the support given to us by members of that regional group.  Fiji’s guiding document  the People’s Charter for Change  Peace and Progress  has given our nation the task of enhancing Fiji’s international relations  both bilaterally and multilaterally. In pursuit of this task  since the beginning of last year Fiji has formalized diplomatic relations with 37 countries  bringing to a total of 114 the number of countries with which Fiji has formal diplomatic relations. Fiji is firmly on the    11-51197 2  path of formalizing our diplomatic relations with all States Members of the United Nations.  Fiji remains steadfastly committed to the work of the United Nations in safeguarding world peace  including all international counter-terrorism efforts. In 2006  Fiji voted in favour of the preparation of a robust arms trade treaty (resolution 61/89)  and we commend all those who have shown commitment to preparing that treaty for signature in 2012.   Fiji’s commitment to the Charter of the United Nations remains steadfast. Our tradition of service in the Blue Helmets of United Nations peacekeeping began in 1978 in Lebanon with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  in which the Fijian battalion served for 24 years. In 1982 when the multinational force and observers were deployed as peacekeepers in Sinai  a Fijian battalion was among them and has remained there to this day. In Iraq  the guard unit of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) has been manned by Fijians since 2004. With the planned withdrawal of the United States forces from Iraq this year  the United Nations has seen fit to increase the size of its UNAMI guard unit and  after due process  Fiji was selected to provide the extra personnel. We thank the United Nations for the confidence it has shown in our servicemen and servicewomen.   In addition  Fijian servicemen and servicewomen are currently stationed in peacekeeping missions in South Sudan  Abyei  Darfur  Liberia and Timor-Leste. I pause here to profess my country’s recognition and respect for the selfless service given by United Nations peacekeepers in the troubled regions of our world  and to pay tribute to those of them who made the ultimate sacrifice.  Fiji is currently the Chair of the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG)  whose membership includes Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Solomon Islands  Vanuatu and the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front of New Caledonia. This year  the MSG was pleased to admit Indonesia and Timor-Leste to observer status. Fiji wishes to commend the work of our brother MSG missions at the United Nations in bringing Melanesian concerns to the attention of the United Nations Special Political and Decolonization Committee. Through its membership of the Decolonization Committee  Fiji will continue to call for the Committee to conduct effective monitoring and assessment of the progress of New Caledonia’s Nouméa Accord. In this regard  we would welcome the establishment of arrangements for closer cooperation and information-sharing between the United Nations Secretariat and the MSG secretariat. We also express our gratitude to the Government of France for its cooperation and assistance to this end.  The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) continue to inspire our economic development efforts. In Fiji  we have concentrated our focus on national infrastructure development under our road map for democracy and sustainable socio-economic development. Under the road map  priority has been given to rural electrification expansion  access to clean water and to national road development. This focus is with a view to creating the bedrock required for sustainable economic growth.   Since the reform of Fiji’s laws to bring them into line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child  further progress has been achieved. We are experiencing increased participation by women in local decision-making bodies  thereby empowering rural women  increasing the enrolment of women and girls in tertiary education  gender mainstreaming within the Government system and increasing the provision of welfare assistance to the marginalized  including single mothers.   The Domestic Violence Decree  which came into effect last year  is now being effectively implemented by the law enforcement agencies in conjunction with civil society groups. Its regime of restraining orders is intended to deter perpetrators of family violence from inflicting further violence  while allowing families to remain together in peace. The Decree recognizes the difficulty experienced by women and children in gaining access to the justice system because of family  community  cultural and attitudinal barriers.   In order to address the MDG HIV/AIDS target  the Fijian Government enacted a new law this year that  among other things  safeguards the privacy and rights of persons infected or affected by HIV. The HIV/AIDS Decree is based on the United Nations international guidelines on HIV/AIDS and on the Declaration of Commitment to a human rights-based approach to dealing with the epidemic. The Decree has been acknowledged as one of the most progressive HIV laws in the world. Fiji participated in and was represented by our Head of State  His Excellency Ratu   3 11-51197  Epeli Nailatikau  at the HIV/AIDS High-level Meeting that was held in this Hall in August.   In addition to the HIV/AIDS Decree  Fiji this year passed the Mental Health Decree  based on World Health Organization guidelines on best practice for mental patients  and the Child Welfare Decree  which creates a system that requires the mandatory reporting of child abuse by doctors  police officers and lawyers to the Ministry of Social Welfare.  Fiji is determined to provide to all Fijians enlightened and progressive laws on health care  access to health services and justice. A large percentage of Fiji’s population is at risk of contracting a non-communicable disease (NCDs)  or lifestyle disease  including cardiovascular or cancerous diseases. We welcome the high-level commitment of the international community to address this crisis and the successful completion of the High-level Meeting on NCDs this week. The Fijian Government has taken key actions to address NCD issues  including being the first country to sign and ratify the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is also one of the first countries to pilot a salt-reduction programme.  The economic reforms undertaken by the Fijian Government have produced positive mid-term results. Last month  we were heartened to learn that Fiji’s economic standing was assessed at a higher level by the credit-rating agency Standard and Poor’s. This improved rating is also attributable to the strong support of all development partners  including the private sector  which have worked closely with the Fijian Government. I wish to take this opportunity to thank them for their cooperation  assistance and collaboration.  As a small island developing State (SIDS) vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change  Fiji has a strong desire to see positive and concrete outcomes achieved at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Durban later this year. We hold firm to the hope of a successful outcome from the UNFCCC negotiations. However  the urgency of the situation for many small island and low-lying coastal States  and the real threat posed by sea-level rise  prompted the Pacific SIDS to draw the attention of the Security Council to the security implications of climate change. Fiji hopes that the presidential statement adopted by the Council in July (S/PRST/2011/15*) at the end of the open debate on the security implications of climate change will enable the Council to look further into the plight of those countries that are most at risk of losing their territory to climate change.  As the first signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Fiji has kept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. With the increasing interest in seabed mining  and in order to avoid a race to the bottom by countries wishing to exploit the untapped mineral resources on the ocean floor  it is imperative that the International Seabed Authority remain vigilant in safeguarding the environmental integrity of the world’s seabeds. Fiji has invested much time and many resources in the responsible consideration of seabed mining  and thus welcomes the Advisory Opinion of the Seabed Disputes Chamber on the responsibilities and obligations of States parties with regard to seabed mining. We also welcome the decision by the Council of the International Seabed Authority to approve the application by Tonga and Nauru for the exploration of polymetallic nodules in the mid-east Pacific Ocean.   We see the Pacific small island developing States as legitimate participants in this oceanic resource. The Pacific Ocean is the mainstay of our country’s livelihood  our food security and our economy. Fiji views the blue economy as an essential element of the green economy. In this regard  we consider the 2012 Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be critical to protecting that economy.  Since I last addressed the General Assembly (see A/65/PV.19)  Fijians have benefited from the nation’s Strategic Framework for Change. The Framework set in place the road map that will take Fiji to the holding of national elections by September 2014. Under the provisions of the road map  from September next year until 2013 our nation must turn its attention to the development of a new constitution premised along the laudable principles set out in the People’s Charter for Change  Peace and Progress. The road map clearly states that in the process the new Fijian constitution must do away with racial categorization and discrimination so that for the first time in Fiji’s history  Fijians will go to elections in 2014 on the basis of common and equal suffrage. That will be real progress. It will undo decades of undemocratic laws and policies inherited from our colonial past and entrenched in past Constitutions that have impeded our nation’s progress.    11-51197 4  This is a determined move to create a society based on substantive equality and justice and respect for the dignity of all Fijians.   As we enter this formative two-year period in Fiji’s history  we recognize that inclusiveness will be an essential part of the process in the formulation of the new constitution. We also recognize our national responsibility at all times to ensure that the nation’s overall peace  well-being and sustainable economic development prevail over divisive factional interests. The Fijian nation will prevail  and we have every confidence that our beloved country has the homegrown ability to pull itself up by its own bootstraps. In this respect  I am happy to inform this gathering that electronic registration of voters for the national elections is scheduled to commence in January next year.  We trust that our trading and development partners  friends old and new  will give us the understanding  the space and the assistance we need to ensure that true and sustainable democracy can take root in Fiji. In this regard  we have taken great heart from recent assurances of support from many of our bilateral and multilateral friends  not least of which is the United Nations.  Once again  I offer my congratulations to the President on his election and my best wishes for a productive sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly."
"59",2438,"FRA",66,2011,"When we met in this very place in September last year  who among us could have imagined that in barely one year the world  already shaken by an unprecedented economic crisis  would undergo such change? Within a few months  the Arab Spring gave rise to immense hope.  The Arab peoples  too long crushed by oppression  were able to raise their heads and claimed the right to be free at last. They fought back against the violence and brutality with their bare hands. To those who proclaimed that the Arab Muslim world was by nature hostile to democracy and human rights  the young Arabs produced the most cogent denial.  We do not have the right to disappoint the hope of the Arab peoples. We do not have the right to destroy their dreams. For shattering the dreams of those peoples would vindicate the fanatics who have not stopped pitting Islam against the West by stirring up hatred and violence everywhere.  That appeal for justice shook the world  and the world cannot respond to that call for justice by perpetuating an injustice. That miraculous spring of the   23 11-50692  Arab peoples imposes on us the moral and political obligation at last to find a solution to the Middle East conflict. We cannot wait any longer. The method used to date — I weigh my words carefully — has failed. So we must change the method.  We must stop believing that a single country — whether the largest or a small group of countries — can resolve so complex a problem. Too many large actors have been sidelined for our efforts to succeed. I mean that no one can believe that the peace process can succeed without Europe  without all the permanent members of the Security Council and without the Arab States that have already chosen peace. A collective approach has become indispensable in order to create trust and to provide guarantees to each of the parties.  Peace will indeed be made by the Israelis and the Palestinians  and by no one else. No one can expect to impose it on them. But we must help them.   The method no longer works. Let us together acknowledge that setting preconditions for negotiation is to condemn ourselves to failure. Preconditions are the opposite of negotiation. If we wish to enter into negotiation  which is the only possible path for peace  there must be no preconditions.  Let us change the method. All the elements of a solution are known — the Madrid Conference of 1991  President Obama’s speech of 19 May  the Road Map  the Arab Peace Initiative and the parameters agreed by the European Union. So  let us stop endlessly discussing the parameters and allow negotiation to begin in line with a concrete and ambitious timetable. Sixty years without one centimetre’s progress — does that not compel us to change the method and time frame to one month to resume discussions  six months to reach agreement on borders and security  and one year to reach a definitive settlement?  As of this autumn  France proposes hosting a donor conference so that the Palestinians can complete the construction of their future State. France wishes to say that we must not immediately seek the perfect solution  because there are no perfect solutions. Let us choose the path of compromise  which is neither renunciation nor repudiation  but which allows us to move forward  step by step.  Thus  for 60 years the Palestinians have been waiting for their State. Has the time not come to give them hope? For 60 years  Israel has suffered from not being able to live in peace. For 60 years  the question of the peaceful coexistence of the two peoples — Palestinian and Israeli — has continued to fester. We can no longer wait to take the path of peace. Let us put ourselves in the place of the Palestinians. Is it not legitimate that they claim their State? Of course it is. And who does not see that creating a democratic  viable and peaceful Palestinian State would be  for Israel  the best guarantee of its security?  Let us put ourselves in the place of the Israelis. Is it not legitimate that  after 60 years of war and attacks  they demand guarantees of that peace  so long awaited? Of course it is. I say that forcefully. If anyone anywhere in the world were to threaten the existence of Israel  France would immediately and wholeheartedly stand alongside Israel. Threats made against a State Member of the United Nations are unacceptable  and they will not be accepted.  Today  we are facing a very difficult choice. Each of us knows — and let us stop with hypocrisy and one-off diplomacy — that full recognition of the status of a State Member of the United Nations cannot be attained at once. The first reason for that is the lack of trust between the main parties. But let us tell the truth: who can doubt that a veto in the Security Council will engender a cycle of violence in the Middle East? Who can doubt that?  Must we therefore exclude an intermediate stage? Why not envisage offering Palestine the status of United Nations Observer State? That would be an important step forward. After 60 years of immobility  which has paved the way for extremists  we would be giving hope to the Palestinians by making progress towards final status.  To show their determined commitment to a negotiated peace  the Palestinian authorities should  as part of that approach  reaffirm Israel’s right to exist and to its security. They should commit to avoiding using this new status to resort to actions that are incompatible with the pursuit of negotiations.  We have but one alternative — immobility and negotiations that go nowhere or an intermediate solution that would give hope to the Palestinians with the status of an Observer State.   In parallel  Israel must observe the same restraint. It must abstain from any actions that would prejudge the final status.     11-50692 24   The ultimate goal must be mutual recognition of two nation-States for two peoples established on the basis of the 1967 lines with agreed and equivalent exchanges of land.   The General Assembly  which has a power to do so  should decide to move ahead  leave behind the fatal trap of paralysis  missed appointments and short-lived attempts to relaunch the process. Let us change our approach. Let us change our state of mind. Each should try to understand the reasoning  sufferings and fears of the other. Each must open its eyes and be ready to make concessions.  In conclusion  I would like to say to the Palestinian people with the deep and sincere friendship I hold for them: “Think of the Israeli mothers grieving for their family members killed in terrorist attacks. They feel the same pain as the Palestinian mothers confronted with the brutal death of one of theirs”.  I would like to say to the Israeli people with the deep and sincere friendship I hold for them: “Listen to what the young people of the Arab Spring are saying: ‘Long live freedom!’ They are not crying ‘Down with Israel’. You cannot remain immobile when this wind of freedom and democracy is blowing in your region”.  I say with deep and sincere friendship for these two peoples who have suffered so much that the time has come to build peace for the children of Palestine and for the children of Israel. But it would be a great shame if the General Assembly did not seize the opportunity of the reawakening of the Arab peoples to democracy to settle a problem that brings unhappiness to these two peoples  who are in any event condemned to live alongside each other. If we take a compromise solution  we will rebuild trust and we will give people hope.  I say that with the utmost gravity to the representatives of all nations. We must assume an historic responsibility. It is the General Assembly of the United Nations that must keep this appointment with History.  Let us reassure Israel and give hope to the Palestinian people. The solution is on the table. Let us take this compromise solution over deadlock. Deadlock might satisfy everyone here  but it will create violence  bitterness and opposition that will imperil the resurgence of the Arab peoples. To that  France says that the tragedy must cease for a simple reason: it has gone on for too long. "
"60",2463,"FSM",66,2011,"Let me begin by extending my warm congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His strong leadership will continue the high standard set by his predecessor. I wish also to express to the Secretary-General my deepest appreciation for his many contributions and accomplishments  one of which is his recent visit to the South Pacific island countries. I congratulate him and wish him well in his second term.  Last July  the Security Council took a giant step with the adoption of a presidential statement (S/PRST/2011/15) during its debate on the issue of climate change and its security implications. We were encouraged by that bold step.  As a member of the Pacific small island developing States (SIDS)  we appreciate the unprecedented action taken by the Security Council as we continue to face the threat to our existence and the loss of territorial integrity and sovereignty resulting from the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. The concerns expressed by the Council in connection with climate change  in particular concerning sea-level rise as a security threat  is an important step.  We cannot but notice  however  the persistent failure and reluctance by some countries to address the security aspect of climate change  even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence. We believe that those who opposed the debate in the Council and those who doubted the security implications of climate change simply ignored the obvious.   We respectfully ask those members who opposed the debate and those who are still in doubt to fulfil their responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. We also take note of the positions of those who aspire to membership in the Council  and we thank those countries who supported our cause. I strongly urge the Security Council  and for that matter the whole United Nations system  to utilize innovative   25 11-51191  ways to address the concerns of the most vulnerable Members of this Organization.  We are grateful for the historic visit by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to our region on the fortieth anniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum. It was also the first time in the 66-year history of this body that a Secretary-General has ever visited any Pacific small island developing State — on this occasion  Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. We are confident that the Secretary-General’s visit will give a greater sense of urgency to the issue of climate change.  Climate change is no longer a hypothetical issue but a real tragedy  as we in the Pacific region are already experiencing its adverse effects. These impacts will continue to worsen until countries like mine disappear  unless immediate and decisive actions are taken by this body to mitigate climate change at first evidence.   It is imperative that we immediately begin to reduce emissions of long-lasting greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. We must complement the action on carbon dioxide by reducing short-lived climate forcers such as black carbon  methane  tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons in order to prevent an additional increase of as much as one degree Celsius in global warming over the next decades. Reducing these short-lived agents is one of the surest ways to protect some of the Earth’s most vulnerable regions such as the Federated States of Micronesia.  I therefore call upon the international community to join this strategic approach to meeting the challenge of climate change. The time to act is now.  More than 60 years ago  my island country  the Federated States of Micronesia  drew world attention as a battleground in the Pacific conflict. Today  the remnants of approximately 60 shipwrecks from that conflict are posing threats to the lives of our people  our environment and the marine ecosystem. Approximately 32 million litres of oil contained in the bellies of the wrecks are a ticking environmental time bomb. Leading experts on underwater corrosion have warned that the shipwrecks will collapse  and when they do  we believe that oil from these wrecks could create a spill on a massive scale  with an impact comparable to the disaster last year in the Gulf of Mexico.  Oil from these shipwrecks in my state of Chuuk has already started leaking. Any disaster could have a devastating effect on the environment  our food chain and the surrounding reefs that serve as breeding grounds for many fish species. It would also adversely impact our tourism industry  which depends largely on coral and shipwreck diving. Thus to avoid a major environmental disaster  I am now appealing to the international community for immediate assistance.  Twenty years ago my country gained membership in the Organization  just in time to become a part of the movement known as the Rio process. Out of that process  the principle of sustainability became a mandate for development. For the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  Micronesia and other small island developing States have been calling for recognition of what we term the “blue economy”. As island nations with millions of square miles of the blue Pacific  we naturally have particular affinity and concerns for the ocean.  Our ocean’s resources have enormous strategic value. We depend on them for our subsistence living and cultural identity as seafarers of the Pacific. The blue Pacific has opened up new horizons in sustainable economic development activities. As custodian of these resources  we welcome the participation of our partners in the utilization of these resources  but for too long we have not received an equitable and fair share of our ocean bounties.  The development of our ocean resources is severely hampered by the continuous selfish behaviours of illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing. If unabated  these kinds of behaviour will continue to deprive our people and our nascent fishing industries of millions of dollars in revenues every year. The fishing industry is further adversely affected by ocean acidification caused by climate change.  Conservation and sustainable management of oceanic resources is important  because we will continue to depend on the ocean in the years ahead. It is for that reason that we have committed to various conservation activities in the Micronesian region. One in particular is our support for the establishment of shark sanctuaries. The Federated States of Micronesia has joined Palau and other countries in committing a vast area in our Micronesian region to be a sanctuary for sharks.    11-51191 26   The current mechanisms for follow-up on the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation are unlikely to provide the momentum necessary to take concrete steps as part of a results-oriented approach. New and additional measures to address the unique and particular vulnerabilities and development of SIDS are required.  Along with the Pacific SIDS  we are advancing a proposal for Rio+20 to consider a third Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of SIDS. We must build upon the momentum of Rio+20 to convene a third Global Conference to refocus and develop new and additional measures that are results-oriented to support the sustainable development of SIDS.  A special category for small island developing States is imperative if the United Nations is to improve the lot of the disadvantaged peoples of SIDS. After all  realities demand it. I therefore reiterate the call made last year by my own country and other small island developing States for the creation of that special category.  I am grateful for the attention paid by the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) held earlier in the week.  It is a major concern for us in the Pacific SIDS that non-communicable diseases have reached epidemic proportions. If allowed to continue unabated  NCDs could potentially undermine our labour supply  productivity  investment and education  with devastating consequences for our economic development. I echo the sentiments on NCDs expressed by Pacific leaders regarding the importance of immediate and decisive actions by Governments  the private sector  civil society  regional and international organizations and development partners to work together to address what is now a human  social and economic crisis for us in the Pacific.  At the beginning of the current session  we witnessed history of another kind unfolding in the Hall. For the first time  a female President stood at this podium to open the general debate. I join other world leaders in congratulating Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff of Brazil on her many achievements. The challenge for this body is to continue to encourage women from all nations to participate on an equal basis at all levels of political decision-making processes. After all  women are equal partners in families.  In joining the debate on the Israeli-Palestinian issue  my country urges the international community to remain steadfast in upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We continue to support Israel’s right to live within secure and recognized borders  free from the fear of terrorism. We also acknowledge Palestine’s right to statehood  which can be achieved only through a negotiated settlement between the two parties. I agree with President Obama that there are no shortcuts to solving this problem.  Just halfway into the year  people everywhere are experiencing the impact of natural disasters  making it the costliest year on record. They have caused not only property damage but also the loss of human lives. I want to extend my people’s sincere sympathies for the lives lost and the suffering everywhere.  On the twentieth anniversary of my country’s admission to the United Nations  we pledge to do our best to support the goals of this Organization for the benefit of our people and all peoples around the world."
"61",2506,"GAB",66,2011,"Allow me  first of all  to warmly congratulate the President on his election. His human qualities  along with his experience  will be invaluable throughout this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. To his predecessor  His Excellency Joseph Deiss  I wish to    11-50871 22  express our gratitude for his extremely skilful presidency. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his unanimous re-election  and reiterate Gabon’s full confidence in him.  Allow me to recall that Gabon has always striven to contribute to peace and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue and mediation. We firmly believe in the link between peace and security  on the one hand  and development and democracy  on the other. Because the people of Gabon enjoy peace at home  as well as with their neighbours and the world as a whole  we are able to achieve new development goals.  This firm belief  which I proposed to my compatriots when I was elected as head of Government  lies at the heart of Gabon’s future vision for development. Since my last statement before the General Assembly a year ago  my Government has moved to take action. We are humbled by the scale of the task and the time required to ensure further progress.  We are already building strategic infrastructure  including preparations for the African Cup of Nations  which Gabon will host in 2012 together with Equatorial Guinea. We are also moving forward with industrial processing projects  beginning with wood  manganese and gas. In addition  we are also making progress with policies to support the service sector. In terms of agriculture  we intend to develop agro-industries  and to support food production and sustainable fishing  which are both so valuable for our food security.  Finally  we are working on a daily basis to implement our steadfast commitment to sustainable development in the context of a green Gabon.  With regard to international peace and security in Africa and throughout the world  Gabon has reiterated its commitment and has contributed according to its means. Since 2010  we have had a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. Last June  Gabon held the Presidency of that body  a role that we discharged with responsibility and commitment.  Turning to Côte d’Ivoire  Gabon has endorsed the actions taken by the United Nations  aimed at respecting the will of the Ivorian people and ensuring the return to a peaceful political environment. We must now support the efforts of the new Government to achieve national reconciliation and reconstruction in our sister country.  With regard to Libya  Gabon has recognized the National Transitional Council and welcomes Libya’s return to the African Union and to the international community at the United Nations. In the Security Council  along with the other two African members  we approved resolution 1973 (2011). It was incumbent on the international community to prevent the bloodbath that threatened to take place in Benghazi. We also needed to cut short a conflict that posed great danger to the civilian population. Today  it is important that Libya emerge from this crisis in order to begin reconciliation for all Libyans and the reconstruction of the country. It is with this aim in mind that we took part in the conference of friends of Libya in Paris. We welcome the role played by the United Nations. It is important to work together with the African Union and other stakeholders. We are ready to contribute to the efforts of the international community in Libya.  South Sudan has also joined the international community. Gabon congratulates the authorities of that newborn sister country and assures it of our support. We welcome the clear determination of Sudan and South Sudan to seek a peaceful way to settle their post-referendum issues.  In Somalia  we must act resolutely because of the serious and urgent nature of the situation. Everything must be done to deliver humanitarian aid to those who need it in the towns and villages in Somalia itself. Gabon responded to the appeal of the international community and has made a contribution.  The issue of Palestine affects us all  so far-reaching are its implications for peace in the Middle East and throughout the world. It is important to stress that we all share the goal  which is the existence of two States  Palestine and Israel. On this question  I wish to express my desire  as I did here in this Hall last year and do this year with even greater hope  namely  to see soon a Palestinian State that exists in peace alongside Israel  within secure and recognized borders. The Israeli and Palestinian peoples  both friends of Gabon  aspire to live in peace and security. The peaceful future of these two peoples is essential for the future of the Middle East and for peace in the world.  Syria represents a new situation that requires efforts on all our parts. We hope that the Arab League’s   23 11-50871  mediation efforts will ensure a peaceful and democratic outcome as a matter of urgency.  Gabon will be particularly attentive to the priority issues throughout this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Gabon is  of course  in favour of reform of the Security Council and reform of the United Nations system in general. We must enable our Organization to better discharge its mission of peace  cooperation and justice throughout the world.   Africa should  in a manner that remains to be determined  have a permanent seat in the Security Council. Africa’s voice must be heard more on the international stage. This expectation on the part of Africa and even other regions of the world is part of our aspirations for a true democratization of global political and economic governance.   As you know  Gabon is fully committed  including within the framework of the United Nations  to protecting the environment and combating global warming. Since I assumed the highest office in my country  Gabon has taken major steps to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to increase the carbon sequestration rate of our forests. My Government has committed itself to modern ways of preserving our tropical forests and biodiversity within our 13 national parks  which cover a little more than 11 per cent of our territory. Gabon has thus launched an extensive campaign to prevent the pillaging of its natural resources and the poaching of its protected species. We are striving to develop our timber industry  while preserving the ecological wealth of our immense tropical forest.   We should also recall that the issues of the environment and international security will face us in the future. At the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban  in South Africa  we will have to deal with that complex of issues in our work and bear in mind the link that exists between the environment and international security.   Finally  we are closely following the efforts under way to delineate the limits of the continental shelf. Given the potential of undersea resources  we should ensure that their future exploitation does not lead to natural disasters.  Gabon is concerned by the impact of the economic crisis on countries of the South  particularly in terms of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The impact of the international financial crisis on public investment in basic social sectors  such as education  health and the provision of drinking water and electricity  is constraining our efforts to promote human development.   Despite significant progress in implementing the Millennium Development Goals  the deadline of 2015 remains for many countries  including Gabon  a difficult challenge to meet. The Millennium Development Goals cannot be achieved unless additional funds are mobilized before 2015. Development assistance is stagnating  and I see real concern as a result of the situation. The international community must make an effort to live up to the commitments it agreed to in Monterey  Doha  Gleneagles  Paris and Accra. We need a new global partnership for development to ensure lasting economic growth in our countries. Aid should be accompanied by more direct investment and more fair and equitable trade. To mobilize new resources  we encourage and support the efforts under way aimed at institutionalizing innovative mechanisms for funding development.  The President of the General Assembly has asked us to discuss the issue of mediation. This issue is at the heart of the very raison d’être of our Organization  which is to guarantee peace and security throughout the world.   Mediation and conflict prevention must remain our primary means of collective action. We all feel the need  in a complex world  to achieve greater democracy  a world where economic and cultural exchanges are better balanced and where crisis prevention  whether it be of political or other crises  is better organized  with  in particular  better early warning systems and mediation.   Gabon is historically attached to mediation and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. This approach has always been one of the bases of our relations with our neighbouring and brotherly countries in the Central African subregion and has played a part in our contribution to the resolution of conflicts in Africa. My country will never depart from that path  in particular at the very moment when Africa is striving to achieve political and economic integration.   Our commitment to the peaceful settlement of conflicts is also part of the commitments that we have undertaken under a number of conventions and treaties    11-50871 24  on human rights  humanitarian law  the promotion of democracy and the rule of law  and international cooperation and solidarity.   We are well aware that mediation has its limits  and the international community must always be ready  if necessary  to consider other ways of ensuring conflict prevention and conflict resolution. Conflicts will be more complex and multidimensional in the future. Economic crises  environmental crises and aspirations for democracy and freedoms  which are taking on new forms  will worsen tensions  and we must follow these developments closely.  Gabon will continue to support and contribute to the mediation efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General on several different fronts and in the various areas of the world where there are conflicts. Those efforts are essential. They must be enhanced by increased resources and be carried out in an impartial way  with full respect for the sovereignty of States. It should also be said that the participation of women is important in all aspects of mediation  since they are always the first victims of conflicts  along with children.   Finally  the United Nations must enhance its cooperation with all the other actors playing a role in this area. In Africa  the African Union  which continues to enhance its mediation capacities  is an essential player.  I would like to conclude by recalling the motto of my vision for our society aimed at making Gabon an emerging country: peace  development and sharing. The climate of peace and stability that Gabon is now enjoying will be invaluable as our country enters a new phase of rapid modernization. More than ever before  Gabon wishes to cooperate with other countries. We are deeply committed to peace. The people of Gabon are therefore ready to exchange  create and build with the rest of the world. "
"62",2553,"GBR",66,2011,"It is an honour to address the General Assembly for the first time  and it is a particular honour to do so as such momentous events unfold in the Arab world. Last week I was in Tripoli and Benghazi. I saw the hunger of a people eager to get on with reclaiming their country  writing themselves a new chapter of freedom and democracy. This has been the most dramatic episode of what has been called the Arab Spring.  My argument today is that Libya and the Arab Spring show that the United Nations needs a new way of working  because the Arab Spring is a massive opportunity to spread peace  prosperity  democracy and  vitally  security  but only if we really seize the opportunity.   So the events of this year present a challenge to all of us — a challenge to Europe to show it can reform its aid and trade strategy to be truly progressive; a challenge to the African Union  to meet the opportunities of this century with the same courage that won liberation in the last; a challenge to the Israelis and Palestinians  to take the bold steps to come to the table and make lasting peace; a challenge to Iran and to Syria  to give their peoples the freedoms they deserve; and a challenge to the United Nations.  One can sign every human rights declaration in the world  but if one stands by and watches people being slaughtered in their own country when one could   25 11-50865  act  then what are those signatures really worth? The United Nations has to show that we can be not just united in condemnation  but united in action  acting in a way that lives up to the United Nations founding principles and meets the needs of peoples everywhere.  The peoples of the Arab world have made their aspirations clear. They want transparency and accountability of Government  an end to corruption  the fair and consistent rule of law  the chance to get a job and to have a stake in how their country is run  the freedom to communicate and the chance to participate in shaping society as citizens with rights and responsibilities.  No one says that achieving those ambitions will be easy. There will be false starts and wrong turns along the way  not least where countries have inherited sectarian and regional divisions  weak political parties  State institutions enfeebled by misuse and a politics distorted by the false choice between repression on the one hand and Islamist extremism on the other.  The long process of developing a new and accountable Government is just beginning. And across the region  we cannot guarantee that the process of reform is irreversible. But let us be clear. These developments present a great opportunity for many who have long been sold short by their Governments  and there is an opportunity and responsibility for all of us  too.  Just as after 1989 we helped those who tore down the Berlin Wall to build robust democracies and market economies  just as in 1994 we welcomed South Africa back into the commonwealth of nations when it chose the path of reconciliation and democracy instead of racial conflict  so now in 2011  as people in North Africa and the Middle East stand up and give voice to their hopes for more open and democratic societies  we have an opportunity  and  I would say  a responsibility to help them.  Now the mistake we often make in the West is to think that because the people in this region want democracy  they will want it in the same way and with the same outcomes that we do. We should not be trying to impose Western values or a single template on the region. Democracy is a process  not an event. Participatory Government involves so much more than just the simple act of voting. The Assembly heard not long ago from President Ahmadinejad. He did not remind us that he runs a country where they may have elections  of a sort  but they also repress freedom of speech. They do everything they can to avoid the accountability of a free media. They violently prevent demonstrations. And yes  they detain and torture those who argue for a better future. So we should never pretend that having elections is enough. The building blocks of democracy have to be patiently developed from the grass roots up. The process will be different in every country. And it is not for us to dictate how Arab nations should respond to those challenges  or to lecture them about how to do it. But there is an important opportunity for us to help  and we must seize it.   There are important lessons from what has happened in Libya. The Libyans liberated themselves. Ordinary Libyans from all walks of life came together and showed incredible resilience and bravery as they rose up and drove out Al-Qadhafi. The people of Benghazi  the brave fighters of Misurata  the people of Zawiyah  the warriors from the Nafusa Mountains  all of them showed incredible courage in liberating their country. The National Transitional Council  which demonstrated great leadership  not least as Tripoli fell  urged people to avoid reprisals and to look to the future — a message that still holds true today.   That revolution truly belongs to the Libyan people. The United Nations played a vital role authorizing international action. But let us be clear; the United Nations is no more effective than the nation States that come together to enforce its will. And on this occasion a coalition of nations across the Western and Arab world had the will to act. In doing so  they stopped Benghazi from joining Srebrenica and Rwanda in history’s painful roll call of massacres that the world failed to prevent. Today  Tripoli and Benghazi are cities transformed. Where there was fear  now there is hope and an optimism and belief that are truly inspiring.   But there are challenges ahead  not just in Libya but all across the region. Economies in the region have underperformed when compared with their peers. In 1960  Egypt’s gross domestic product per capita was comparable with Korea’s. Today it has fallen to around just one fifth of the size. Across the region  some countries dependent on oil revenues  and others held back by heavy State control have failed to diversify and create jobs in productive new sectors and failed to connect themselves to the economies of the region and the wider world.     11-50865 26   Indeed  less than four per cent of North African trade is within the region  making it the least integrated neighbourhood in our world. And the promise of economic reform has not been fulfilled. Too often people were told economic reform would bring them market economies with greater freedom to start up businesses  to trade  to grow and to create wealth. But it did not. It brought them corrupt and crony capitalism. Now the future is for the people of this region to determine  but I would urge them not to reject something they have never had — a genuine  open  fair and transparent market economy  which has proved the world over to be the best way to create jobs and wealth. And the need for economic success is vital  because this is a region where 60 per cent of the population is under 25  and youth unemployment is nearly double the world average.  It is a region that must create 50 million new jobs by 2020 just to keep pace with its population; that means 700 000 new jobs every year in Egypt alone. And these jobs should not be just for men. Let us be honest. It is not just the men of the region who want a job and a voice. The unemployment rate for Egyptian women is more than three times that of men. And it is not only the economy where they are denied the chance to play a fuller role. It is society and politics and culture too. But look at the crowds in Freedom Square and we see it is the women too  finding their voices  showing clearly that they want to play a part in building their future.  So  in this historic period  when the voice of this region is finally being heard  there is now a unique opportunity for women to fulfil their ambitions too. This is not just in the interests of women. It is in the interests of those countries as a whole. Let us be clear. You cannot build strong economies  open societies and inclusive political systems if you lock out women. So the Arab Spring will not succeed if the opportunities that are opening up are denied to half of the population.   Now  of course  the actions we take to support the people in each country must be tailored to that country  with respect for its particular culture  history and tradition. What is right for Libya will not necessarily be right for everywhere else. But the international community has found its voice in Libya  and we must not now lose our nerve. We must have the confidence to speak out and act as necessary to support those who seek new freedoms.   In the European Union  it is time to ensure that the billions of euros we spend in this region each year are used to support reform that will meet the aspirations of the people. And there should be no more excuses for denying the people of the region fair access to our markets  including in agriculture. Here at the United Nations  we have a responsibility to stand up against regimes that persecute their people. We need to see reform in Yemen. And above all  on Syria  it is time for the members of the Security Council to act. We must now adopt a credible resolution  threatening tough sanctions.  Of course we should always act with care when it comes to the internal affairs of a sovereign State. But we cannot allow this to be an excuse for indifference in the face of a regime that  week after week  arrests  intimidates  tortures and kills people who are peacefully trying to make their voices heard.   The voice of the African Union is vital too. Africa has rightly challenged the world to meet its aid commitments. I am proud that Britain will meet its commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income from 2013. And all the countries that made promises at Gleneagles and elsewhere must meet those promises too. In the case of Britain  it means we have been able to provide £124 million of emergency aid to 3 million people facing starvation in the Horn of Africa. But at the same time  Africa must meet its responsibilities too.   Many will find it hard to understand why countries in southern Africa which fought so hard to throw off oppression themselves  have been so slow to respond to the Arab Spring. Of course  I recognize that many have long been committed to non-intervention. But my argument is that where action is necessary  legal and right  to fail to act is to fail those who need our help. So it is welcome that the African Union is taking steps to recognize the National Transitional Council in Libya  as many African countries have already done. Africa’s responsibility now is to embrace and support Libya’s new  inclusive and democratic future. And this must include ensuring that those wanted for serious crimes are brought to justice  and that the wealth stolen from the Libyan people is returned to them.   We all have a responsibility to the Palestinians too. A key part of the Arab Spring is the right of Palestinians to have a viable State of their own  living   27 11-50865  in peace  alongside a safe and secure State of Israel. And I strongly support this. There has been much speculation about what will happen here this week. Let us be clear about one fact. No resolution can  on its own  substitute for the political will necessary to bring peace. Peace will only come when Palestinians and Israelis sit down and talk to each other  make compromises  build trust and agree. So our role must be to support this  to defeat those who embrace violence  to stop the growth of settlements and to support Palestinians and Israelis alike to make peace.   But the opportunity in Libya and elsewhere in the region is not just about achieving a more open society  prosperity and the building blocks of democracy for their own sake — it is about security too. Some have argued that stability in the Arab world can only be achieved by the tight control of strong authoritarian regimes and that reform is a threat to stability. In fact  the opposite is true. Reform is the basis of long-term stability. Authoritarianism threatens it.   While there is never a justification for resorting to terror  if people’s hunger for a job and a voice are denied  there is a real risk that the frustration and the alienation they feel will cause them to be drawn to more violent and extremist responses. That is not just a problem for one region. It is a problem for all of us. Here  in this great city  where 10 years ago  people of 90 different nationalities were killed in the most horrific terrorist attack in history  we must recognize that political and economic reform in the Middle East is not just good in its own right  but that it is also a key part of how  in the end  we will defeat Al-Qaida.   Of course  we must meet terrorist activity with a strong and resolute security response. Al-Qaida and its offshoots must know that they will have no safe hiding place to plot or recruit young men to train as terrorists. But in the long term  we must defeat not only the terrorists  but the extremist ideology that feeds them. Al-Qaida’s poisonous ideology has thrived on repression. Democracy is what it fears most. People are not in Tahrir Square in Cairo and Freedom Square in Libya for an Islamist caliphate  but for a job  a voice and a future. And we must heed their call  for their freedom and for the security of us all."
"63",2577,"GEO",66,2011,"It is of course a great honour and a profound responsibility to address the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly on behalf of my people.  The United Nations is the international community’s great legacy of the past century  an institution resulting both from history’s most outrageous crimes and from humankind’s capacity to confront  reckon with and overcome the consequences of such crimes. Such human contradictions — “the highest heaven and the deepest abyss”  to quote Friedrich Schelling — are symbolized by the two remarkable anniversaries we commemorate this year. I am surprised that no one in the Hall has mentioned that this year marks the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union  which freed captive nations and emancipated oppressed peoples  unleashed the dreams of millions  put an end to decades of cold war and an apocalyptic nuclear race and heralded a new era of international relations. It was clearly not  as one nostalgic leader put it  the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century. Nor was it  as some analysts and diplomats dreamed  the end of history.   Ten years later  in this very city  another major event took place  this time a real catastrophe. It reminded us in the most horrific way that history was not over and that it remained tragic. On that terrible day  even those who had failed to pay heed to a decade of grim wars in the Balkans and the Caucasus  in Africa and in Afghanistan  had to abandon their illusions that a new world order free of conflicts had emerged for good.  The attacks on New York and Washington  D.C.  were not aimed at a single country  but instead targeted a set of values and a way of life — freedom and democracy. That day  11 September 2001  reminded us that the world remained a true battlefield — a battlefield not among religions  as many people claim  or of nations  but a battlefield within every religion  every nation and every culture; a battlefield between those who try to build and those who seek to destroy  between those who choose freedom and those who pledge to eradicate it; a battlefield between nihilism and the very idea of civilization.   Ten years later  the remarkable upheavals in the Arab world have offered us yet more proof that there is no end to history  nor is there a clash of civilizations. Instead  a universal call to freedom is rising even in places where some doubted it could ever rise. It is being met by a monstrous effort to quell it. As we speak  the highest heaven and the deepest abyss are once again in conflict. It is our duty as leaders to weigh in and speak out  to decide and to act.  The first anniversary I evoked earlier — the fall of Soviet tyranny — continues to reverberate today in important ways. When the moment came 20 years ago for us  the former subjects of the Soviet bureaucracy — students  artists  dissidents  workers  men and women  old and young — it was hardly the end of history; on the contrary  it was a new beginning of history. Communism had frozen our will in a cold and closed museum. When it collapsed  the doors of history swung open again. We found ourselves confronted at once by both the best and the worst. The best transpired for those nations quickly integrated into the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The others — like the people of my country  Georgia —   7 11-50871  were left to the mercy of failed States  civil unrest  wars  ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation.  Two years ago  from this very podium  I suggested that there were two ways to leave communism behind and to re-enter history — the way of Vaclav Havel and the way of Slobodan Miloševic  the way of liberal democracy and tolerance  on one side  and the way of authoritarianism and ethnic nationalism  on the other. There are  in other words  men who embrace freedom and men who erect mental and physical walls against it.  To the latter  who still see the extension of the European Union and NATO as a threat  I would like to say that the Cold War ended in December 1991 and that they should not be afraid of having democratic neighbours who wish to join wider democratic clubs. There is no hidden agenda or secret plot in any of those capitals to undermine the sovereignty of big nations. The Cold War ended 20 years ago and  slowly — too slowly — new rules are emerging. And even those rules are still too rarely applied.  Little by little  tyrants are beginning to fear that they could one day be held accountable for their crimes. I am convinced that there will be less and less tolerance for the ethnic cleansing and other war crimes that have stained my country and so many others. That is the very reason for the existence as the United Nations  is it not? The United Nations exists to make the world a little better  to finally enforce the rules  charters  laws and principles upon which we have all come to agree.  It is time to understand that the world has changed and that an army  as powerful as it might seem  cannot ultimately deny the will of the people; that a Government  as strong as it might look  cannot unilaterally and freely dismember sovereign nations; and that we are not in 1938 or in 1968  but in 2011.  As I speak  the Russian Federation militarily occupies 20 per cent of sovereign Georgian territory  in violation of international law and the 12 August 2008 ceasefire agreement. As I speak  almost 500 000 internally displaced persons and refugees in a country of less than 5 million people continue to suffer because they are denied their right  a right reaffirmed over a dozen times by this very body  to return to their homes and villages. They cannot go back because  in Moscow  a foreign leader has decided that their home is no longer their home.  To such cynicism and brutality we respond with calls for justice and commitments to peace. Last year  on 23 November  I addressed the European Parliament and solemnly pledged that Georgia would never use force to liberate those of its regions currently occupied by the Russian Federation. Even though the United Nations Charter gives us the authority to do so  as we well know  we definitively renounced military means to restore our territorial integrity. The commitment I made before the European Parliament is legally binding; I have sent relevant letters to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to other international organizations.  It will soon be one year since Georgia renounced the use of force. One year has passed  and we are still waiting for Russia’s leadership to reciprocate this gesture of peace. Unfortunately  instead of dialogue  the response we have received has come in the form of a dozen terrorist acts targeting Georgia  attacks directly organized and supervised by confirmed officers of the Russian secret services  which has been authenticated by different international actors.  The Cold War is over  but some leaders have yet to realize that fact and stop reasoning in terms of spheres of influence  near-abroad domination and zero-sum games. The Cold War is over  but embargoes  blackmail and brutal diktats are still used against Ukraine  Moldova and Belarus. The Cold War is over  but even the Baltic States have to deal with manipulation of their democratic political landscape and neo-colonial games with their minorities. The Cold War is over  but the old Soviet habit of playing on ethnic and religious hatreds is still alive. That is especially true in the black hole that the North Caucasus has become  with brutal violence  displacement and the killing of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants.  Georgia is responding to these brutal and dangerous policies by opening its borders  inviting people to come to engage in exchange  debate and dialogue  by trying to overcome the information blockades  by trying to rebuild bridges between nations — those essential bridges that others are systematically trying to destroy. Georgia is responding to military build-up with programmes to lift children out of poverty through access to modern technologies — computers  the Internet — and with new hotels and new boulevards and cycling paths. Georgia is responding to methods of the past by embracing the    11-50871 8  promises of the future  and many others as well — new health-care systems  hundreds of new hospitals  advanced programmes to deal with communicable and non-communicable diseases  and insurance for all.  The end of the Cold War launched an era of opportunity and turbulence  liberating local dynamics in ways both tragic and exultant  and leading to a constant flux in the world order. It has unleashed hatred  ethnic conflict  mass terror  genocide and many other human calamities. But it has also generated fantastic emancipations.  Think of the “coloured” revolutions in Eastern Europe  the dazzling development of Asia  the progress of democracy in Africa or  more recently  the Arab Spring; none would have been possible if the Soviet Union still existed as a global player and a global threat to all the continents  including Africa  Asia and Europe alike. Since 1991  history has become more and more unpredictable  swinging violently between the highest heaven and the deepest abyss that Schelling referred to. Indeed  who could have anticipated the global consequences of a desperate act by a 26-year-old Tunisian  Mohamed Bouazizi  in the remote town of Sidi Bouzid?  One poor man  in an unknown place  was denied his rights by an imperious police and  like a distant echo of the Czech Jan Palach in front of the Russian tanks in 1968  he immolated himself. This breathtaking act of despair has literally turned the world upside down.  Some dictators are jailed or on the run; regimes considered untouchable have collapsed; new constitutions and orders are being born. An entire region and culture derogatorily labelled as unfit for democracy by some people in more developed countries has given the whole world  including the developed world  a lesson in freedom.  Such historical eruptions always come as a surprise. They require from us all the radical astonishment that Aristotle considered as the very beginning of philosophy  the first step towards true wisdom and a radical emancipation from our prejudices and dogmas.  Very few predicted the revolutions that swept across Eastern and Central Europe in 1989  or the “coloured” revolutions that followed 15 years later. Even fewer predicted Tunis  Cairo  Benghazi and Tripoli. The popular call for freedom that has shaken the world in 2011 is the best and most definitive answer to the hatred that motivated the attacks against this very city 10 years ago.  When aspiring populations are free to live their lives  practice their trades  raise their children  voice their ideas and press their grievances  the space for terrorists to recruit or demagogues to sow ethnic hatred starts to evaporate.   International police  military and intelligence cooperation in the war against Al-Qaida over the past decade have been  and still are  essential in protecting our freedoms. I am proud that Georgia has borne more than its share in the international effort in Afghanistan. I am proud of our thousands of soldiers who risk everything in order to defeat the international movement of hatred — and I want to pay tribute to those who have died on the battlefield. I am proud of our police who are engaged in the struggle against nuclear trafficking. I am proud that Georgia has become a provider  not just a consumer  of international security.  I am proud of all of this  but I am also very aware that extremism will not be defeated and terrorism will not be eradicated by military and police means alone. Terrorism and extremism can be defeated only if freedom  democracy and prosperity extend their reach in the world.  This is why we welcomed so genuinely the efforts of President Obama and President Rousseff in launching the Open Government Partnership. The world has to respond to the universal call for freedom and justice  and only a coordinated response to this call can guarantee our common long-term security.  Georgia is ready and willing once again to take on more than its share in this international effort. Our experience of radical post-revolutionary transformation over the past eight years could very well be useful for the newly liberated lands.   We were not always free. We were a totally failed State  a dying economy  a country destroyed by corruption and authoritarian structures. In 2003  a peaceful  popular revolution brought to power a young team of reformists. From one day to the next  we were in charge of a fragile country in a hostile geopolitical environment. We discovered quickly that the slogans  roses  flags and other tools we used as opposition and   9 11-50871  civil society leaders would no longer suffice. We discovered  in fact  that revolutions are not only  and not even mainly  about the crowds gathered in the streets  but that they consist essentially of the long and difficult process of reform that follows the uprising.  This is the main challenge that Tunisia  Egypt and Libya now face. The uplifting images of people celebrating liberation in Tahrir Square  or Libyan citizens dancing in Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s palaces  are already in the past. The success of those revolutions will depend on what happens after the legions of reporters from CNN  the BBC and Al-Jazeera have left.  This is precisely the moment when our Georgian experience — both successes and shortcomings — could prove useful. Of course we hardly succeeded in everything  and we made many mistakes. But we have also had astonishing results.  In the aftermath of the Rose Revolution  we fired 100 per cent of our entire police force. Georgia lived for three months without a single policeman. Amazingly  during that period  crime rates went down dramatically. Why? Not only because the police were responsible for a large part of our crime rate  but also because there was a shared feeling that our citizens finally had a stake in their country and that they were living actors in a very specific moment of our nation’s history — a moment when everything seemed possible  when values became the basis of politics and when one had the feeling of inventing one’s own future. This feeling is the true engine of history and our best ally against extremists. But it is a fragile feeling that has to be nurtured and sustained.  In Georgia  we have managed to keep this feeling alive until now by a permanent process of reform with clear benchmarks. Thanks to radical changes in our police force  customs  tax service and bureaucratic structures  and thanks to the widespread feeling among people that they own these transformations  we have made greater progress on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index since 2003 than any other State in the world. We are the second or third least corrupt State in Europe  according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) survey.  We have built a highly favourable investment climate based on efficiency  transparency and the rule of law. As a result  we are now ranked as one of the easiest places in the world to do business. The World Bank ranked Georgia  based on five years of records  as the world’s number one economic reformer. No other country has progressed in that five-year period as we did. We are ranked first in Eastern and Central Europe in terms of business  as I said  as one of the easiest places in the world.  The 2011 EBRD survey on countries in transition singles out Georgia as the most successful country in our region in terms of institution-building  on par with developed European countries.   There is still a lot to be done  obviously. We are more committed than ever to pursuing our path of reforms and to continuing to build our democracy  even as the barrels of hostile tanks point at us just 40 kilometres away from our capital.  Of course  the path to efficient democratic Government is difficult  but it is the only path. Of course  people will be impatient and disappointed  but there is no alternative to the success of this call for freedom. This is why it is so important to support this call and to deter those who want to suppress it.  This is why we supported the NATO-led intervention in Libya at the initiative of the United Kingdom  France and the United States. The very fact that the National Transitional Council is now sitting here  in the Hall  and that Al-Qadhafi can no longer speak from this rostrum should give hope for the future to all of us. The very fact that this effort was approved by the Security Council has shown that that institution can actually be the essential framework for the defence of human rights.  The two anniversaries we are marking — the anniversary of the fall of the Soviet empire and the anniversary of 9/11 — continue to confront us with this central question: how can we ensure that the new spaces that have opened in our world in the past 20 years thanks to the fall of dictators and thanks to the spread of new technologies are filled by peace rather than violence  by tolerance rather than extremism and by freedom rather than new forms of enslavement?  History will judge our generation by how actively we help to answer this question  particularly in a series of pivotal arenas  in what people call abusively frozen conflicts in and near my own region  in the many countries in the international community that remain under tyranny’s yoke and in the places like those Arab    11-50871 10  States that have achieved a new spring of freedom and are starting the difficult work of reforms.   Wael Ghonim  the young Egyptian Google executive who helped connect and mobilize so many of his country’s people to stand up for freedom  recently said that the new revolutions  like the one his country experienced  are a little like Wikipedia: they are grand  open projects to which everyone can contribute.  The need for participation applies to us as well. As national leaders and as key decision-makers  we can contribute and we must contribute. Let us rise to that historical imperative. Let us all make our contribution  so that  together  we may avoid the deepest abyss and strive instead for the highest heaven."
"64",2624,"GHA",66,2011,"Permit me to extend hearty congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session. May I also use this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the able manner in which he presided over the sixty-fifth session.  Ghana joins the rest of the world in welcoming our sister country  South Sudan  to the family of the United Nations. It is our fervent hope that South Sudan  having taken its rightful place in this body  will grow and prosper. We also want to congratulate the Secretary-General on his appointment to a second term. It is a clear manifestation of his excellent performance during his first term.  It is a long-established fact that United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities have contributed immensely to the Organization’s efforts for the maintenance of international peace and security over the years. We observe  however  that this activity continues to take on complex dimensions that require long-term planning and urgent reforms in order to enable the United Nations to tackle the challenges that crop up.   It is in this connection that Ghana reaffirms its support for the ongoing reform agenda being undertaken by the United Nations in consultation with the troop- and police-contributing countries. However  we do want to emphasize that regular tripartite consultations are needed among the United Nations  the Secretariat  the Security Council and the troop- and police-contributing countries.  As one of the top contributors of police and troops to United Nations activities  Ghana remains unwavering in its commitment to the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. Accordingly  I want to assure Members that as long as financial  human and material capacities exist at the national level  Ghana will continue to provide troops and police personnel for United Nations operations.   But it is important that the burden and costs to the United Nations of these activities be equitably shared among Member States. We think that countries such as Ghana that provide troops and police personnel for these operations must be financially supported by donor countries in a timely manner. We are aware of    11-51185 2  the financial constraints existing at all national levels  but we want to encourage Member States to meet their obligations to the United Nations so that the Organization can execute its mandate.  Allow me to pay tribute to all United Nations personnel — including those from my own country  Ghana — who in the course of the year made the ultimate sacrifice while on United Nations peacekeeping missions. May their souls rest in peace and their sacrifice be cherished and remembered.  Another issue that we are following with keen interest is the proposed arms trade treaty. Ghana fully supports this and thinks it is necessary. Hence our satisfaction thus far with the outcomes of the meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty held in New York last year and in February and March this year.   As a nation  we consider a strong and effective arms trade treaty to be an indispensable step in preventing the flow of arms to destinations where they can cause mayhem and wreak havoc by fuelling conflicts that may in turn undermine national and regional peace  security and development  or exacerbate tensions that in the long run may create situations that need the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers.   For developing countries such as Ghana  the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons and other conventional weaponry continues to pose a serious threat to our national security and to our socio-economic and political stability  given the linkage to other crimes such as terrorism  organized crime  drug trading and indeed human trafficking  among others. It is therefore imperative that the remaining meetings of the arms trade treaty Preparatory Committee produce proposals that would close the loopholes that allow the flow of these weapons from legitimate to illicit markets.  The United Nations reached a significant milestone with the launch of UN-Women — the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. It is critical as member States of the international community that we break gender stereotypes  which after all are the root cause of the myriad of gender-inequality challenges facing us throughout the world. Ghana’s efforts are focused on addressing gender imbalances and misconceptions and on improving the living conditions of women and girls  bearing in mind that in solving the gender issue we would be taking concrete steps towards the attainment of a majority of the Millennium Development Goals. It is our expectation that the objectives of UN-Women will be met.  On the occasion of the High-level Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action  Ghana recognizes the progress so far made in this area by the opportunity given to Member States to reaffirm and strengthen their political commitment to the prevention of and fight against racism and racial discrimination in all its forms. We are confident that the effective implementation of the outcome policy (see resolution 66/3) will indeed ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all  including the victims of racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance  in all societies.  It is noteworthy that the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases focused on the developmental drawbacks and socio-economic impact on developing countries where the relevant facilities are not available. Indeed  we are of the opinion that the effective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases not only helps to reduce poverty but also decreases health-care costs  thereby improving productivity and ultimately helping with rapid economic development.   Efforts in Ghana to improve the health-care system include the completion of the health-care infrastructure in several parts of the country  the scaling-up of the National Ambulance Service to cover all districts and the training of emergency medical technicians. We have re-engineered our policies in order to give more meaning to health-care delivery.  Ghana recognizes and appreciates the contribution of youth to nation-building and the growth and sustenance of our democracy. We believe that the adoption of the political declaration urging Member States to adopt comprehensive plans and measures to give meaning to youth development is commendable  especially since this is the International Year of Youth. In Ghana we are implementing policies that are intended to situate young men and women in the centre of nation-building.   One of the main reasons for our relentless fight against drug trafficking is to ensure that we secure the future of our young men and women  who  after all    3 11-51185  will be the future leaders of our dear nations. As we continue to invest heavily in our youth by expanding educational opportunities and making it possible for the disadvantaged to have access to formal schooling  we believe we are laying the right foundation. The provision of free school uniforms  free exercise books and the elimination of more than one thousand schools under trees  turning them into brick-and-mortar structures  should be ample evidence of our determination to brighten the future of youth. Certainly Ghana’s oil and gas find should present us with a greater opportunity to create the conditions under which we will be able to create more jobs to solve youth unemployment in our country.  Climate change is the defining human development challenge of the twenty-first century and one of the greatest threats to sustainable development in Africa. Although as a continent we contribute only 4 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions  we are the most vulnerable when it comes to climate change. Therefore urgent and concerted action is needed to enable us to maximize the opportunity that climate change offers.  We believe that with the right investments in technology  institutions and infrastructure by the international community and nation-States  we will be able to unleash the potential of agriculture  harness the maximum benefit from water resources  expand access to modern energy sources  fight diseases and conserve tropical forests.   As we move closer to the climate change negotiations scheduled for Durban  South Africa  it is our expectation that the critical political questions that could not be answered during the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Cancún will be addressed. With regard to mitigation  we believe that we need political commitment  a high sense of flexibility and strong leadership to ensure that at the Durban Conference the second round of commitments under the Kyoto Protocol will be addressed or some transitional arrangement made.   Again with regard to mitigation  we believe that all pledged commitments and actions should be quantified  monitored and verified by the international community. We commend the obvious progress made in the design of the institutions of adaptation  such as the Green Climate Fund. What remains to be done is to determine the sources of funding for the Fund and also to empower the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to have control over the Green Climate Fund.  On the political and security fronts  Ghana notices a paradigm shift  or at least a shift in emphasis  from national security to human security. We agree that interventions targeted on human security will eventually define our national security. We are therefore implementing measures that will help us make this concept take form through the adoption of the necessary legislative measures  institutions and reforms. We are taking steps to expand our adherence to the rule of law  the promotion of transparency and good governance  the maintenance of the independence and integrity of the judiciary  and the promotion of a free media. We also subscribe to the global norm of the responsibility to protect  and we promise to work hand in glove with member countries  the United Nations and others to achieve this.  A little over a year from now Ghana will be going to the polls to elect a President and Members of Parliament for another four years. To ensure that the elections are free  fair  transparent and credible  our Electoral Commission — which has successfully organized the last three elections  since the year 2000 — has put in place the necessary measures to enable Ghanaians to make their choices in a free atmosphere. Our democratic credentials stand tall  and we would not want anything to affect the standard that we have achieved.  Just as the United Nations and the rest of the international community kept an eye on the 2008 elections in Ghana  I should like to invite you  Mr. President  and all others to come and do the same in connection with the 2012 elections. We want to make sure that people are given the right to vote and choose their own leaders  instead of having leaders imposed on them or come in through unauthorized means.  Finally  I wish to reaffirm Ghana’s total commitment to the aims  objectives and ideals of the United Nations. I also want to advocate that all Member States muster the necessary political will to ensure that the United Nations functions more effectively. "
"65",2670,"GIN",66,2011,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly as the first democratically elected President in the history of my country since its independence  following a free  transparent and credible election whose result was accepted by all. My country paid a high price for the dawn of democracy  to which I have devoted almost 50 years of my life.   Today  Guinea has turned an important page in its history. I would like to take this opportunity to express the people of Guinea’s gratitude to the international    11-51191 10  community  in particular the International Contact Group on Guinea  for their untiring efforts in the context of my country’s return to constitutional normality. To those thanks  I add my brother and friend President Blaise Compaoré  President of Burkina Faso  who  as mediator in the Guinean crisis  spared no effort to restore constitutional order in Guinea.  My presence in this Hall  which says much about the history of peoples and nations  represents Guinea’s return to the international stage. This is the place for me to assure the international community of my Government’s commitment to respect and promote human rights  strengthen unity and national harmony  build a democratic society and ensure the progress and prosperity of the Guinean people.  The challenges to be addressed are many and complex. The socio-economic situation that we inherited was hardly bright: an utterly failed economy with the resulting inflation  corruption and a completely dysfunctional State.  The outcome of the presidential election in November 2010 therefore expressed the legitimate aspiration of the people of Guinea to profound change that would foster the economic and social development of the country. That thirst for change is also justified by the considerable backwardness evident in our country despite its considerable human and natural resources. That is why  the day after the presidential election  we committed without delay to a series of remedial measures in order to provide the way for better governance in the country.  Strategies and dynamic policies were drawn up and implemented to improve people’s living conditions. Among the reforms pledged  the Government grants agriculture priority in order to achieve food self-sufficiency. Likewise  the mining sector is being reorganized through the adoption of a new more attractive policy that takes into account the interests of Guinea and its partners.  As part of that momentum for change  actions continue for the modernization and restructuring of the judicial system in order to ensure the promotion and protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms and to establish an attractive investment climate.  On the financial level  reform will make it possible to control inflation  prevent the misappropriation of public funds and avoid having to print money  as well as allow us to combat poor governance  impunity and corruption. Strict management measures  such as the State one-stop shop  strengthening economic oversight and the overhaul of the administration  as well as undertaking audits  will stop financial losses and correct malfunctions.  Apart from the steps to improve macroeconomic management and the structural reforms that I have just described  the Government has drawn up poverty reduction strategies to meet the population’s basic needs for income and access to basic social services  in particular drinking water and power supplies. Sustainable development being a major goal of the Government  it is clear that the health-care  education and environment sectors are among our Government’s priorities.  However  that ambitious programme to combat underdevelopment and poverty cannot be fully accomplished without the ongoing and effective support of the international community. Moreover  negotiations are under way with the Bretton Woods institutions on the signing of an agreement  which is almost complete  on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative to considerably reduce the Guinean debt. That will enable us to free up considerable financial resources and devote them to the sustainable development of our country.  I wish to acknowledge our deep appreciation for  and to renew our faith in  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank for the efforts already agreed on implementing our development strategy. I would also like to take this opportunity to express the Guinean people’s gratitude to all bilateral  regional and multilateral development partners for their valuable contribution to the national development effort.  National reconciliation remains the cornerstone of our action. My approach in that process is to directly involve the population at the grassroots. In that context  I set up a provisional commission of reflection  co-chaired by the Grand Imam and the Archbishop of Conakry. That commission will work with the wise men of the regions and prefectures on the ways and means to bolster national unity for a genuine reconciliation.  As a component of the nation  the army is among our priorities. The reforms seek to make it a truly   11 11-51191  republican institution — guardian of peace  security and development.   Women and young people are key stakeholders in our socio-economic development. Those sectors of society receive my Government’s constant attention. In that regard  the empowerment of young people and women is another important factor.  Following the presidential election  the people of Guinea are now working to prepare legislative elections  which will enshrine the return to constitutional order. In that context  we decided to establish a secure computerized electoral roll that will make it possible to correct the anomalies noted during the presidential election and to ensure the participation of all Guineans of voting age in the election.  The Millennium Summit  held in New York in 2000  committed itself in an ambitious declaration to reduce extreme poverty by 2015 (see resolution 55/2). Despite several meetings  strategies drawn up at the State level and the participation of the international community  in particular through the Monterrey Consensus  the Rome summit on food security  the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development and the Beijing summit on social development  many challenges are still to be addressed.   We therefore need to periodically assess the direction of the supporting measures to ensure that the lofty goals that have been set are met. That approach is shared by external partners  political parties  civil society  unions and other actors.   Despite the international community’s repeated calls for peace  areas of conflict and tension continue in several regions of the world  in particular in Africa  the Middle East and Asia. The occupation of Palestinian land by the State of Israel is an ongoing concern. The Palestinian people must exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights  including the right of return to their lands and the right to establish an independent State  within the borders established before June 1967  in peace and security alongside the State of Israel. That principled path alone could lead to a comprehensive and lasting peace  which is a guarantee for all countries in the region  including Israel.  The advent of a stable climate in Côte d’Ivoire  a brother country and neighbour  is reassuring after years of fratricidal clashes.   My delegation welcomes the entry of the Republic of South Sudan into the body of free nations.  The tragic humanitarian situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa is a source of serious concern. The efforts of the United Nations  the African Union and humanitarian organizations and institutions currently under way to provide assistance and protection to populations in distress must continue. The adoption of a comprehensive regional plan for food security and self-sufficiency would provide a lasting solution to the current crisis. However  Guinea attaches great importance to the positive settlement of the fratricidal conflict in Somalia.   The Republic of Guinea has always participated in the collective effort to promote international peace and security  and it seeks to strengthen its role in that area. Indeed  my delegation believes that mediation is the most effective tool for the prevention and settlement of conflicts and for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is clear that States must create the domestic conditions to prevent and settle disputes with the support of the United Nations.   In addition  subregional  regional and international organizations must adopt mediation mechanisms  while working closely with other actors  such as civil society and youth and women’s organizations. In the particular case of Africa  my delegation would hope that priority be given to African mediation mechanisms  whose action has shown to be effective on several occasions.   Given the relevance of the central theme of the current session  the Guinean delegation hopes that our debates will further strengthen the role and action of our universal Organization. The United Nations is the crucible of our aspirations and the mirror of our collective vision and our joint fight for improved well-being and peace. To that end  it must pursue in-depth reforms of its structures  operation and decision-taking mechanisms so as to be more effective and credible.  I wish to reaffirm the joint African position agreed at Ezulwini for fairer representation on the Security Council. In that regard  Guinea will continue to support the action of the Secretary-General  whose re-election fills us with great joy. We are convinced that the new mandate will enable him to continue and to strengthen his efforts towards achieving the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter.    11-51191 12   I could not finish without conveying my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-sixth ordinary session. I wish him every success in carrying out his difficult task. To his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  I would like to express our gratitude for his excellent work during his term."
"66",2709,"GMB",66,2011,"We praise Almighty God for making another gathering of world leaders possible. Allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His proven leadership and competence will certainly be in great demand as we collectively confront some of the daunting challenges of our time. My delegation also views his election as a demonstration of the strong commitment of the brotherly State of Qatar to the fashioning of a stable and just world order. He will have our full support in the discharge of his mandate.  His predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  also deserves our praise for the sterling work he did as President of the General Assembly. We wish him well in his future pursuits. We also congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment and wish him a fruitful second term. My delegation will render him all the support he will need as he helps to tackle the issues that are dear to us  especially the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the resolution of conflicts in Africa  among others.  The United Nations was founded as a world body primarily to maintain international peace and security. For this reason  the theme chosen for this General Assembly — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” — is particularly apt. My delegation is a strong believer in the role of mediation as a conflict resolution mechanism at both the national and international levels. We can all agree that mediation produces results. That is what our experience in West Africa  my own part of the world  tells us. At the national level  for example  in the Gambia we have instituted the alternative dispute resolution mechanism  among other mechanisms we have in place  with a view to settling disputes between and among our peoples and institutions.  For us in Africa  the mediation of conflicts  particularly with a view to amicably resolving them  has always been part and parcel of our rich cultural heritage and customary law. We must revive those time-honoured dispute-resolution traditions of our forebears. Experience has also shown that with strong regional and subregional leadership many of the intractable civil  political and electoral conflicts that beset and plague Africa could certainly be resolved through mediation.   Regional ownership of mediation processes is also essential. For example  recent conflicts in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau were all resolved through a combination of interventions by the Economic Community of West African States  the African Union (AU) and the United Nations. We must therefore always give mediation a chance before resorting to the use or threat of the use of force. The international community must give priority to mediation in any conflict before it threatens military invasion or outright military intervention without giving mediation a chance. It costs less to mediate — we all agree — than to launch a full-scale military intervention  only to have to come back again and rebuild and reconstruct.  Over the past decade  the leadership of West Africa  in close collaboration with the international community  has invested great material and human resources to bring the conflicts that affected that region to peaceful ends. Today  the region enjoys relative peace  but that does not mean that spoilers have given up attempts to derail the peace. We must be vigilant at all times. For example  the evils of drug trafficking  piracy  and the trafficking of illicit goods and arms have reared their ugly heads across our subregion of West Africa. The nature and extent of those crimes call for swift international action to nip them in the bud before it is too late.   All these crimes feed on each other and sow the seeds of terror  economic sabotage and indeed the collapse of social order. We must therefore pool our resources in the areas of detection  surveillance  law enforcement and prosecution in order to deny the culprits safe havens. In order to do that  we must come together and agree on a framework for cooperation  of   15 11-51384  course with the support of the international community. We look forward to greater United Nations engagement with regional and subregional leaders and organizations in stamping out those menaces.  The Gambia will always be an agent of peace through mediation and shuttle diplomacy in West Africa and beyond. As we have done in the past  we will support all efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of conflicts and disputes within our subregion. We will also continue to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world  as we have already done.  With strong African leadership  we continue to witness the amicable resolution of many civil conflicts that plague the continent. The key lesson in most of those situations is early intervention by leaders who mediate between stakeholders. Regional leaders should always be put at the forefront of mediation efforts.   For that reason  we salute the untiring leadership of the African Union in bringing about peace in the Sudan. We equally salute the leadership of the Sudan for its magnanimity in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Accord  which led to the independence of South Sudan. My delegation encourages both sides to invest in their shared future through a negotiated settlement of the pending issues.   Let me also take this opportunity to encourage our brothers in Guinea and Niger  after successful democratic transitions  to bury the hatchet and move forward as united peoples. National reconciliation efforts should be diligently pursued by all stakeholders. We therefore call on the international community to render them all the support they need as they try to bring peace and development to their countries.  As a developing country  like all others we have our eyes set on the countdown to 2015  a landmark year for all of us. The Gambia and the entire international community have only a few more years before we can tell how many of the MDGs we have met. What is evident from all the reviews  however  is that we are surely on track to meet some of the MDGs but still struggling to meet others. We know for certain  for example  that the critical element for achieving all MDGs on the target date will remain international donor support and collaboration. We have just embarked upon our new programme for accelerated growth and employment  which is our blueprint for development in the Gambia for 2012-2015  which we earnestly believe will be generously supported by all our development partners and friends.  It is no secret that the ongoing financial and economic crisis  worsened by market volatility  is taking a huge toll on the meagre economic gains of our fragile economies. In view of our situation as least developed countries and of the vulnerabilities that we continue to encounter  it is urgent that we all support the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action. We must not allow it to suffer the fate of its predecessor  which suffered from weak implementation.   It is our hope that our partners from the North will do all in their power to support the enhancement of our productive capacities. We also call on the emerging economies of the South to enhance their cooperation with us in ways that will render true meaning to South-South cooperation. My delegation is ready at all times to forge meaningful partnerships across the North and South in order to bring food security to our people  tackle youth unemployment through education and skill development  and enhance the quality and coverage of our health-care delivery systems.   In addition  we have to revisit the various programmes and strategies adopted by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and other global forums in order to comprehensively address the food security needs of developing countries. The small-scale farmer — including the female farmer — must be placed at the centre of the new Green Revolution.  The impact of climate change continues to pose a formidable challenge to all of us. The solutions to reversing the negative impacts of climate change through adaptation and mitigation initiatives are well known. Our problem today is the refusal of the biggest polluters to assume their responsibilities in reversing the negative trends of climate change occasioned by human activity. We cannot afford to be in denial for long. The science is solid and there for all to see  and the solutions are very clear  so let us embrace them by fulfilling our international obligations.   The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) should be about the implementation of commitments and not about reneging on them. It should also be about the announcement of workable initiatives and not about the    11-51384 16  repackaging of previous unfulfilled commitments. Rio+20 should ultimately be about binding commitments. Let us bequeath to our children  and their children an Earth that is resilient and a better world for them.  My delegation would like to congratulate the delegation of Libya  especially the leadership of the National Transitional Council  on being steadfast in their drive to rescue Libya from the brink of the abyss. We have faith in that leadership and are convinced that it will institute the necessary reforms that the Libyan people have so valiantly fought for. As Libya embarks on the crucial task of reconciliation  reconstruction and nation building  we — as the first African country to have officially announced its recognition of and support for the National Transitional Council — would like to assure the Libyan leadership of our full collaboration and solidarity at all times.  The conflicts in the Middle East  both recent and long-standing  require fresh and honest mediation efforts with a view to stabilizing the region once and for all. The disorderly change that is sweeping across the region is a cause for concern as livelihoods are shattered and industries like tourism are destroyed  thereby creating more unemployment and entrenching endemic poverty. With regard to the Arab Spring  my delegation fully supports and hereby salutes the leadership role of the League of Arab States  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Gulf Cooperation Council in finding peaceful resolution to those conflicts through mediation  diplomacy and brotherhood.   In the same vein  we salute the role the AU has been playing in bringing to an end some of the most violent conflicts in human history on the African continent through mediation and in some cases through military intervention as a last resort. We have used former Heads of State as mediators in Africa and in councils of the wise  and some of those efforts have proven to be very successful.  One of the most intractable conflicts of our time is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The sad reality is that numerous United Nations resolutions continue to be flouted. The daily killing  collective punishment and humiliation of Palestinians are going on unabated. Denial of humanitarian assistance  essential medical supplies and construction materials to Palestinians has become the norm. For that reason  my delegation not only supports but recognizes an independent and sovereign Palestinian State within the confines of the 1967 borders. An independent Palestinian State with full rights and privileges like any other is long overdue. That is the only guarantor of lasting peace in that region.  The Islamic religion  which is synonymous with peace  is misunderstood and misrepresented in some quarters. We condemn those who turn themselves into suicide bombers to kill innocent people or conduct inhuman behaviour in the name of Islam  as such acts are contrary to Islamic values and teachings. Muslims  Christians  Jews and peoples of other faiths must all join hands  for once  in fighting terrorism of all shades. We must also be tolerant and indeed respectful of each other  no matter our beliefs  and live side by side in peace and harmony as one human race and one human family.  In the case of Syria  we call on the international community to encourage and support the Syrian Government and people to resolve their internal problems through diplomacy and peaceful means. Poverty should not be a pretext for violent and disorderly change of Government in developing countries.  The need for constructive dialogue in finding lasting and timely solutions to transboundary problems  wherever they exist  is more urgent today than ever before. Let us avoid postponing the search for a permanent solution to the decades-old conflict in the Nagorno Karabakh region. It is the responsibility of the international community to work with a greater sense of urgency to address the Nagorno Karabakh conflict without further delay.  The developments in Cuba continue to demonstrate to the world the inhumanity of maintaining the decades-old embargo imposed on that friendly country. The embargo is a manifestation of intolerance of other people’s right to a political system of their choice. There is universal agreement that the embargo needs to come to an end without precondition and be replaced with good-neighbourliness  tolerance and respect for the legitimate right of Cubans to have a political system of their choice. We therefore once again call on the United States of America to lift the sanctions and embargo on Cuba now.  The case of Taiwan deserves better scrutiny by the international community. Taiwan  with a population   17 11-51384  of 23 million people  continues to play an active and positive role on the international stage. In a highly integrated and interconnected world  almost all issues demand the full participation of and cooperation among all nations. Taiwan’s efforts in promoting peace  particularly in the Asia-Pacific region  deserve commendation and further encouragement by the General Assembly.   For example  over the past three years  Taiwan has engaged mainland China in dialogue on a wide range of issues ranging from agriculture and health to intellectual property rights and economic and commercial cooperation  among others. Furthermore  since 2009 Taiwan has been invited by the World Health Organization to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer. That practice and the related arrangements have established what has been termed the WHA model  which sets a useful precedent for Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations system generally.  Given that Taiwan is today one of the leading technological and economic powerhouses of the world  its participation in global affairs is quite relevant  bearing in mind the numerous issues that we collectively confront. We must give it the prominence that it deserves. Issues such as natural disasters  terrorism  climate change  epidemics  financial meltdowns and many others require the engagement of every member of the international community  including Taiwan. We therefore urge the United Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized agencies and mechanisms of the United Nations system  including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Climate Change Conferences immediately.  Reform should be a permanent feature on the agenda of all international organizations. Cosmetic reforms or the deliberate stalling of overdue reforms seriously undermine the effective responsiveness of organizations. In 2005  as we all remember  a draft of reform measures was introduced by the General Assembly  which led to reforms in management of the Secretariat  human resources administration  the creation of the Human Rights Council  the Peacebuilding Commission and the elaboration of new norms.  The then Secretary-General remarked that no reform of the United Nations is complete without reform of the Security Council. Let us not delude ourselves. The Security Council urgently needs comprehensive reforms. A major element in the reform of the Council is the glaring underrepresentation of Africa  for example  in all its categories of membership. Africa certainly needs to be adequately and properly represented  and we will not give up on what is a legitimate demand. What is even more appalling is that negotiations are progressing at a snail’s pace. Although we are mindful of other positions  we are convinced that negotiations must lead to a just outcome. Security Council reform is long overdue  and the lack of it is undermining the credibility of our Organization and the legitimacy of the Council’s decisions.  In conclusion  my delegation would like to repeat what we said before. Reform of the United Nations must recognize the geopolitical realities of the African continent and its peoples. Africa is no longer the colony of any country and must be respected and treated as such. The system of veto power and flawed representation in the Security Council is not acceptable  can no longer be tolerated and in fact runs counter to the spirit and letter of the basic principles of equality and fair play as enshrined in the United Nations Charter."
"67",2749,"GNB",66,2011,"I would first like to congratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to express our most sincere wishes for his success in fulfilling his mandate. Similarly  I would like to convey to Mr. Joseph Deiss Guinea-Bissau’s appreciation for the spirit of engagement and dedication he brought to his successful conduct of the work of the sixty-fifth session.  Let me also reiterate my congratulations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon  on his recent reappointment  the fruit of the excellent    11-51360 12  work he has done to help consolidate peace and development around the world.  And I would like to take this happy occasion to salute the Republic of South Sudan on having joined the United Nations  becoming the Organization’s most recent full Member.  Today  24 September  Guinea-Bissau celebrates the thirty-eighth anniversary of its independence. That historic achievement was the Guinean people’s first major victory  and from this rostrum I pay the homage that is owed to our country’s freedom fighters  whose courage and determination enabled us to attain the status of a free and independent State.  As our national authorities have stated and has been unanimously recognized by the international community  defence and security sector reforms are urgent priorities for us  since their implementation can strengthen peace and stability in our country and thus create the conditions needed for sustainable development. With the signing of the Tripartite Agreement Protocol or Memorandum of Understanding between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and the Government of Guinea-Bissau  which will take place at the margins of this session of the Assembly  we will be able to make a major qualitative leap in the implementation of defence and security forces reform  as well as in effectively implementing the programmes contained in the ECOWAS road map.   In that regard  Guinea-Bissau’s commitment to mobilizing resources to sustain the reforms has led to a decision to create a special pension fund  into which we will have deposited $200 000 of the $500 000 we pledged to the fund by December 2011  as proof of our firm commitment to contributing 10 per cent of the total resources required. We therefore expect to hold a high-level meeting with our development partners this year  in order to obtain the financial and technical resources required to implement the reforms  and we appeal to all our partners to participate in and commit to the meeting.  Drug trafficking and organized crime are a current subject of discussion in the Organization  and  as is well known  the West African region to which we belong cited as a hub and Guinea-Bissau is also often singled out as a transit point for illicit drugs. In full awareness of this reality and recognizing our known problems  we are proud to say that we were one of the first countries to request the good offices of the United Nations  through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  to help us deal with the issue with determination and effectiveness.  In order to combat drug trafficking and organized crime  the Government  through its Council of Ministers  has adopted two important instruments  a political declaration and a plan of action  which include large-scale actions in the following three areas: strengthening the legal system  strengthening the criminal justice system  and combating drug use and HIV/AIDS. Alongside such measures at the national level  the Government is seeking to sign bilateral agreements to strengthen the fight against drug trafficking  keeping in mind that  without strategic cooperation between the countries of origin  transit and consumption of drugs  there can be no effective fight against drug trafficking.  Therefore  from this rostrum  we reiterate our appeal  as we have many times before  for help in controlling our maritime borders. We address this appeal to countries that are better prepared than we are to do so. We are making a formal request for the support of the United States and the European Union and its member States  since we cannot single-handedly fight drug trafficking  which  as we all know  is increasingly powerful and sophisticated.  We are approaching the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  but despite ongoing efforts  Guinea-Bissau continues to face challenges with regard to basic sanitation  supplies of drinking water and energy  and the provision of primary health services  to cite only the most pressing issues. The high rate of poverty that still prevails in our country has forced the Government to adopt an ambitious agenda for the future  embodied in our national poverty reduction strategy document and based on the pillars of stability  peace  economic growth and poverty reduction. That document defines the main challenges and recommends priorities for the next five years. As a result of serious and rigorous implementation of this strategy  the Government that I have the honour to lead has already successfully reversed this negative trend.  The current economic situation is clearly improving  the result of progress made in the last two and a half years in strengthening public policy and   13 11-51360  improving macroeconomic performance  as our partners  especially the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  will testify. As a result of our excellent macroeconomic performance  the country reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative  thus achieving forgiveness of about 90 per cent of its external debt and the recent re-evaluation of the growth rate of its gross domestic product  which is now fixed at 5.3 per cent  which is higher than originally predicted. We have all the conditions needed to maintain and accelerate this trend during the next year.  To that end  in addition to relying on our own resources  which can now be devoted to poverty reduction programmes  the Government will organize a round table of donors in the first quarter of 2012 to mobilize the necessary financial resources for the implementation of those programmes. In that context  we appeal once more for the participation of and contributions by all traditional donors that are interested in our country and that wish to support national efforts aimed at overcoming our current weaknesses.  Let me once again welcome the establishment of UN-Women  an entity that reflects the firm commitment of our Organization to the struggle for gender equality and to ensuring that women have the conditions necessary for a more representative and active participation in the process of transformation that is under way in our societies.  In the same context  my country is taking measures to uphold the dignity of women  including measures to promote their empowerment and the affirmation of their autonomy. I welcome the steps taken recently by the Guinean Parliament  which approved the criminalization of female genital mutilation and increased penalties for trafficking in minors.  Guinea-Bissau’s status and credibility in the international arena depends largely on its ability to define and implement a foreign policy that takes into account the great universal values of democracy  freedom and human rights  which are our values as well.   In our diplomatic efforts  we have to be consistent with our historical commitments and  above all  faithful to all who selflessly helped us in the struggle for the affirmation of our dignity.  From that perspective  we welcome the decision of the Palestinian Authority to submit a request for the recognition of the State of Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations. We encourage a constructive dialogue on the basis of the possibility of peaceful coexistence and mutually advantageous cooperation between countries and peoples.  This session of the Assembly is taking place at a time when major changes are occurring in the Arab world. These changes call for greater political and social rights  as well as values such as freedom and democracy  and  for that very reason  the Arabs have our sympathy and solidarity. We regret  however  the cases where transition incurs high costs in terms of human lives.  With regard to Libya  Guinea-Bissau fully supports the position of the African Union and expresses its full readiness to cooperate and to strengthen the increasingly friendly relations and cooperation with the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people.   We urge the United States Government to draw on the values that define that great nation and to resume its relationship with Cuba  ending the embargo that has lasted for more than five decades and freeing the Cubans still being held in its prisons.  The responsibilities of the United Nations are increasing  and the globalization of the decisions that it is called upon to take is becoming increasingly urgent.  The historical reasons that led to the establishment of the Security Council are no longer current. The demographic representation of the different regions of the world  the emergence of new countries and new geopolitical configurations oblige us to accept as natural the reform of the Security Council. We deem it legitimate to want the decisions of the Security Council to be made more inclusive and participatory through giving our continent both permanent and non-permanent seats  as is the wish of the African Union  because of the large representation of the African continent.  Under the auspices of the President of the Republic  Mr. Malam Bacai Sanhá  the National Assembly launched a process of national reconciliation involving all the forces of the nation. That important initiative has contributed to the establishment of the    11-51360 14  climate of peace and understanding that now prevails in the country.  To conclude  I take this opportunity to thank all friends and partners of Guinea-Bissau for their support and solidarity and to assure them that we will spare no effort in consolidating peace and building a more just society to create better living conditions for the Guinean people."
"68",2788,"GNQ",66,2011,"I participate in this debate of the General Assembly in our dual position as President in Office of the African Union and President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. I do so in the full conviction that the passage of years and the experience accumulated in the 66 years of the life of this world Organization will inspire the international community morally and united in social and political solidarity around universal norms and principles in order to address any threat or situation that may affect the planet. With this conviction in mind  I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  Permanent Representative of Qatar  on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. He represents an ancient culture that has contributed much to the development of humankind  and hails from a peaceful country that demonstrates solidarity and contributes to the maintenance of peace  stability and development in the world. We are certain  that under his leadership  the United Nations will be able to solve the serious problems affecting our countries.  We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his re-election to the helm of this world Organization  in recognition of the work that he has done over the past five years despite the various political  economic and social crises that our planet has faced and is continuing to face.  On the basis of that conviction  the United Nations  given the current trend whereby it is being converted into a club for the powerful  must reconfigure itself so that it can resume its place as the most representative and equitable organization in the world — one in which those whose problems it is endeavouring to resolve can participate and have their voices heard. That would ensure the democratization of all of the organs of this universal institution.  With respect to peace and security  Africa  which is witnessing various fratricidal conflicts caused  in most cases  by internal and external factors and by third parties  has firmly stated that it is in favour of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  wherever they may be taking place  through dialogue  mediation and negotiation.  Africa  a continent whose countries and peoples have been exploited for centuries by foreign Powers  today is experiencing a new iteration of neocolonialism  involving the intervention of forces on the basis of humanitarian principles and democratic freedoms. In this connection  Africa must bring to the fore its international political personality so that the African Union is respected  moving beyond internal differences caused by unspoken interests.  Intervention by force  internal or external  has never provided a lasting solution to conflicts since the creation of the United Nations  as has been seen in the various conflicts that have taken place in the past 50 years. Unfortunately  we can see that the United Nations is being used dishonestly  under the pretext of humanitarian interventions  when in fact those interventions have served only to further violate the human rights of the peoples affected. The use of force in a conflict is not a unifying factor but rather one of division and destruction.   The African Union recognizes the victory of the National Transitional Council of Libya in its fight against totalitarianism and recommends that its Government undertake a programme of transition aimed at the holding of free and transparent elections  ensuring their legitimacy through the participation of all of the groups that constitute the community of Libyan people.    11-50692 36   With regard to the situation in Tunisia and Egypt  we also call on their Governments to adopt the legal and administrative structures necessary for democratic processes and State institutions.   I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the State of South Sudan on its accession to membership of the United Nations and to express our wish that the peoples of the Sudan and of South Sudan will live in peace and harmony with all of their neighbours and with the international community.  Today’s world is suffering from an economic and financial crisis whose consequences are unpredictable. It is the result of the irrationality of the current political  economic and social world order  which has moved away from the social and humanitarian principles of equality  justice and fairness.  In the political realm  we cannot transplant the cultural values of a country or a group of countries to others simply because the world  and policies themselves  are becoming increasingly globalized. Rather  we must promote dialogue and coexistence among cultures and civilizations  because  if we do not do so  the principle of the self-determination of peoples will automatically disappear.  It is true that democracy is a noble principle and applies to any cultural value that is practiced and accepted by peoples. To say otherwise would be to betray the spirit of democracy that must develop in consonance with the cultures of respective peoples.  On the economic front  the social dimension of peoples must manifest in the form of productive activities that benefit humankind. In that context  we cannot see any justification for the barriers  blockages and discrimination that we see in current economic  scientific and technical exchanges among nations  which only perpetuates the impoverishment of some and the ever-increasing enrichment of others.  Indeed  the level of participation of the African continent in world markets is ridiculous  not even topping 1 per cent despite its economic and human potential  which studies have described as representing the future salvation of humankind. Africa calls on the developed countries to show solidarity and help us to develop our economy so as to become an integral part of this planet.   Africa is not asking for a handout. Africa requires a level of economic and technological support that would enable it to process its vast resources  which  while contributing to accelerating its development  would also have an effect on the economic stability of its partners. All of this requires profound changes in the way in which we think about the current system and a readjustment of the methods and procedures used in international economic trade.  The social order is determined by the political and economic order  but the political cannot develop properly unless the economic does as well. In that respect  Africa is making great efforts to develop its national democracies  and many African States have adapted their political  legal and administrative structures to the basic requirements of democracy.  Nevertheless  in order to translate theory into practice  certain basic requirements must be met that meet the material needs of humankind. Thus many countries failed in this respect. Instead of their plans coming to fruition  they became engulfed in fratricidal conflicts because they did not meet such basic needs.   Moreover  the African continent is facing  in addition to the economic crisis  the devastating effects of climate change  natural disasters  drought  famine and communicable diseases  which claim millions of victims. In that respect  the African Union recently organized a donors conference to support victims in the Horn of Africa  with Somalia being one of the countries most affected. The African Union has honoured its commitment to tackle this emergency. However  the helping hand of the international community is still needed.  We believe that developed countries whose industries are responsible for atmospheric warming should meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and compensate developing countries for the damage and harm resulting from the effects of atmospheric warming.  The groups at greatest disadvantage in this crisis are women  children and young people. However  young people without physical  intellectual and moral development cannot take up the mantle from the current generation to ensure the future of nations. Hence there is a need to provide the necessary moral and material assistance to young people to ensure the development of the continent in the future.  In that regard  the African Union Summit held in Sipopo  Equatorial Guinea  adopted a programme for   37 11-50692  promoting the employment of women and young people and the fight against underemployment  as well as to provide professional and academic training. This programme needs the support of the international community.  In my own country  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  we are committed to the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015. During the national economic conference held in 2009 to plan for the rational use of our oil resources and others  the Government adopted a national economic development programme  with the aim of ensuring that Equatorial Guinea joins the ranks of emerging economies by 2020.  In parallel to this programme  the Government is carrying out political  legal and administrative reforms in order to optimize the development of democracy and ensure control  transparency  good economic and political management and guarantee maximum respect for human rights.  The political environment in my country is optimal for promoting peace  stability and reconciliation among all political forces  who work together in harmony with a unified set of consensual political criteria.  Finally  Equatorial Guinea is participating in these discussions with a good measure of optimism  based on our belief that  contrary to the selfishness that prevents many States from joining their efforts to tackle the problems facing our world  what we are seeing every day is a growing awareness and international moral determination that the United Nations should be a veritable centre for the unity and cohesion of the international community.  Indeed  while Africa was isolated in the past  today the groups of countries who trust in Africa  its States and the contribution they can make to the global development continue to grow. We wish the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly every success."
"69",2834,"GRC",66,2011,"I should like to thank the outgoing President of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  and congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar on his election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May I also express my gratitude for the efforts and leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has skilfully guided our Organization in these difficult and demanding times. Two world wars taught humanity the necessity to infuse national relations with respect for a few simple yet powerful ideals. That is what the United Nations is all about — respect for peace and good-neighbourly relations; respect for the rule of law and the international justice system; and respect for the fundamental right of every person on this planet to have a chance for a better life. The United Nations is what we  its Member States  make of it. We are the driving force behind its accomplishments. We are the reason behind any of its failures. The United Nations is where we meet and agree or disagree on global cooperation  and when we agree  humanity becomes stronger.  Today the United Nations is leading vital international cooperation in tackling climate change and desertification. There is also the challenge of non-communicable diseases  which hinder macroeconomic development and keep the bottom billions of people locked in chronic poverty. Unregulated migration is putting huge pressure on some countries  including Greece  as a result of — even to the further detriment of — the low level of development in the countries of origin  poverty and wars. There is the crucial contribution of the United Nations and its Human Rights Council on human rights issues  a contribution that can grow with a stronger mandate for the Human Rights Council. Greece is standing for election to the Council for the 2012 term and deeply values the support of every single one of its partners in that effort.   Perhaps the most overarching responsibilities of the United Nations lie in the area of peace and security  for without peace and security it is much more difficult  if not impossible  to pursue the myriad other goals of the Organization. Those goals include ensuring nuclear security  combating terrorism and combating piracy. They also include managing crises as they arise  as in the recent case of Libya  and working together with our partners in the international community to establish and keep peace. This also    11-51197 16  means  as I said earlier  fostering good-neighbourly relations the world over.  Just as we need to work together as global partners to face the challenges of our time and the challenges of the future  each of us also has a role to play in a given region. Greece’s immediate region is South-East Europe  the Balkans. Greece has a vision for peace  stability and cooperation in our region. Its key component is the European perspective of our region as a whole and of our individual neighbours. To this end  two years ago Greece launched Agenda 2014  which is aimed at revitalizing our neighbours’ efforts to realize European aspirations  on the one hand  while also re-igniting the European Union’s vision of welcoming the countries of the Balkans into the European family. Indeed  creating a European neighbourhood of peace and cooperation in south-eastern Europe should be our collective goal  and that is because peace and cooperation are anything but a foregone conclusion in the Balkans. Recent history  often bloody history  makes that abundantly clear.  There are still pending issues that need to be resolved. One serious obstacle to the consolidation of peace and security in our neighbourhood is the Kosovo issue. Recent progress in the European Union-brokered talks between Belgrade and Pristina gives some cause for optimism in the wake of the tensions we saw in the region over the summer. Those tensions remain. They still need to be dealt with and defused. Greece wishes to facilitate the process of reconciliation and compromise. It wishes to foster the kind of understanding that our neighbourhood needs on the path to its common future in the European family. That is a policy that works. Regional cooperation platforms  the South-East European Cooperation Process  the Black Sea Economic Coordination Organization  the regional Cooperation Council and others are bringing us closer together as partners. Serbia has made impressive progress on its path to the European Union  progress that must be recognized without question marks. So has Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina must be supported in its efforts towards reconciliation  unity and progress. Albania is in the process of overcoming internal divisions and returning to the path of reforms under specific European Union criteria. Croatia’s success story gives impetus to the entire enlargement process for the Balkans.  Another issue that needs our attention is that of the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  which is not really and has never been a name issue per se  but instead a sincere effort to ensure that in our volatile region we put behind us  once and for all  notions of irredentism  of attempting to rewrite history and borders  so that our children can be raised not with suspicions and bitterness towards each other but with friendship and hope for living next to each other. Greece believes  and has repeatedly stated  that the solution lies in a fair compromise  in a name with a geographical qualifier since Macedonia is a geographic region that overlaps the territory of more than one country  and that this name must be used in relation to everyone  erga omnes. We want to resolve this issue so that we can finally realize the huge potential of our relationship on the basis of openness  honesty and trust. It is high time to reach a successful and mutually beneficial conclusion. As I have often said  this should be a time to write history  not to keep trying to rewrite it.  South-East Europe is only one side of Greece’s neighbourhood. In our southern neighbourhood  the eastern Mediterranean  we have witnessed the awakening of people’s desire for democracy  the hope for a better future. We have witnessed the Arab Spring. Our proximity to the region and to the countries there that have been swept by calls for change is reflected in our active presence in the region. Add to that a long-standing tradition of relations of trust and friendship with the Arab world and Members can see why Greece has embraced a vital role in these developments.   In Libya we conducted unprecedented evacuations for tens of thousands of non-Libyans  provided ground support for the implementation of the Libya no-fly zone  mediated the release of European military personnel early in the crisis and established a diplomatic presence early on in Benghazi to liaise with the National Transitional Council. We are now offering infrastructure on Crete as a staging area for the efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation in Libya. The importance we attach to developments in Libya  Egypt  Tunisia and throughout the region derives from the point I made earlier. Without peace and security one does not have cooperation  the cooperation needed for development and for improving the day-to-day lives of the people.  We  as the international community  have an obligation to help our southern neighbours achieve their goal of democracy  of having a voice in their affairs and of hope and future prosperity. I am talking   17 11-51197  about the same rights that the Syrian people have also been demanding for months  the rights that their own leadership is at present violently denying them. The Arab world does not need new hegemons who see the present turmoil as an opportunity to promote self-serving agendas or for establishing new spheres of geostrategic influence or economic power. It needs genuine friends who see Arabs as equals and who are willing selflessly to assist the Arab world in its transition to democracy and true self-determination. Greece and the European Union  under the guidance of the United Nations  can and must play that role.  Nowhere is the lack of peace and security more pronounced and more chronic than with regard to the Palestinian question. Greece supports unequivocally Palestine’s right to statehood. It is now our responsibility  the responsibility of every Member State of the United Nations  to respect the Palestinian decision to request membership and  more importantly  to turn this into an opportunity that will jump-start new  direct negotiations. Palestine has a right to exist finally as an independent State  just as Israel — let us not forget — has an equal right to exist in full and uncompromised security. The European Union  on its own account and within the Quartet  has a crucial role to play in this effort. Greece will continue to engage in dialogue with both sides and support Catherine Ashton and the European Union’s efforts within the Quartet and with the parties.  Within this context of regional tension and volatility but also great potential hope  it should be self-evident that we need to avoid adding still greater tensions in the eastern Mediterranean region  which is why we are deeply concerned by the recent threats and hostile actions against the Republic of Cyprus by our neighbour Turkey  in violation of international law. As the European Union  the United States  Russia and others have already stated  Turkey’s threats and actions over the past few days and weeks are contrary to international law and they must cease. We believe that the path of tension is a wrong and dangerous path. Instead of threats our region needs strong countries that can work together to promote stability  cooperation and good-neighbourly relations among all  and always within the confines of international law.   That is the hope and example that we can give to a region and that a region expects of us  which is why Greece is committed to the peaceful path of exploratory talks with Turkey for the delimitation of a continental shelf  failing which we believe we should submit the issue to the International Court of Justice for resolution. We expect Turkey to refrain from actions that undermine that spirit of cooperation. That is why we strongly support the United Nations sanction talks currently under way between President Christofias of Cyprus and Mr. Eroglu  talks aimed at the reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal  bicommunal federation and the ending of Turkey’s illegal occupation in accordance  with United Nations resolutions and European Union law.  Finally  economic development and fair distribution of wealth are key prerequisites for long-term stability and security. My country  in the midst of its own worst financial and economic crisis in recent history  has not only not shut itself in its shell but remains a leading investor in a region  especially in the western Balkans  contributing to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. Internally we are overhauling our economy by investing in sustainable growth and in Greece’s competitive advantage sectors  including green energy  shipping  tourism  sustainable agriculture and high-tech infrastructure. Externally  our businesses are becoming even more outward-looking. The economic integration of our region along the growth axes I have described  and other complementary ones  is certain to multiply its economic potential. It is thus certain further to enhance the peaceful integration and cooperation of all of its people.   It has often been said that every crisis is also an opportunity. If that is true  then our region  riddled as it has been for decades with big and small crises  is arguably today the region in the world that harbours the greatest opportunities for peace  growth and stability. It is in our hands to make this happen. Let us begin."
"70",2875,"GRD",66,2011,"I am honoured to extend congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his appointment to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth regular session. As two small countries  Qatar and Grenada share much in common. Accordingly  we look forward to his leadership and stand ready to support him for the good of all the members of the General Assembly and the United Nations itself. We welcome   9 11-51197  his theme on mediation because we believe that when mediation is properly applied it can minimize confrontation in the world. I also commend the outgoing President  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his stewardship and dedication during the past year. Grenada congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to a second term as Secretary-General and wishes him continued success.  Now in its thirty-seventh year of independence and membership of the United Nations  Grenada renews its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter  believing that universal adherence to those principles provides guidance to the United Nations to act on what may seem intractable  for the United Nations is intended to lead  perhaps more so in difficult times.   Grenada supports the pursuit of international peace and security. We believe firmly in the rule of law  the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights. We also support the fight against terrorism  as well as the campaign against the illicit drug trade. All these pose serious threats to the security of our changing world. My Government reiterates its commitment to the United Nations Charter. In support of the role of the United Nations  this year the Government of Grenada has signed three global conventions  including the Convention on Cluster Munitions  helping to bring about disarmament.  We are all obliged to work selflessly to preserve our planet for future generations. The avoidance of nuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore congratulate all Governments that have expended much time and effort on nuclear non-proliferation.   Since we met a year ago  the world and the United Nations itself have faced many challenges — economic  social and political — all of which undermine stability and people’s survival. The economic crisis continues to weigh heavily on Grenada. Our population is experiencing high food and fuel prices  national revenues have decreased  and debt continues to be high. The green shoots of recovery that others have experienced have not reached us. For us  the economic crisis of 2008 still rages and we must find a way out of it. Social and political strife remain  if not in Grenada  in other parts of the world. These demonstrate that the search for freedom and justice is far from over.   Human suffering and instability anywhere in the world hurt us all  even in tiny Grenada  where unemployment in major capitals affects our tourism and even our remittances from abroad. The major challenge facing Grenada as a small island developing State is how to reduce our weaknesses  how to increase our resilience  and how to pursue development for people today and for their children tomorrow.   How are we to respond? We must attempt to achieve growth with equity  especially for women and youth  and to support general improvements towards people’s advancement — that is  create stable environments and opportunities for our people to thrive — and we must do so while contributing to a just  peaceful and democratic global framework. We believe that whatever the challenge  our common political will for fairness and justice must remain our overarching guiding principles in matters economic  social and political.  Grenada’s main response so far has been to strengthen our democratic processes and to advance the Caribbean regional integration movement. At the national level  we promote social inclusion in the governance of the country that engages civil society  the media and the people as a whole. We have instituted consultations and participation in major policy and legislative matters  including the revision of old laws and the making of new ones. At the regional level  we are working with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  two groupings that constitute the unbreakable link with our national undertakings and how we engage internationally.  Grenada’s efforts to achieve sustainable development can be helped by both the December 2011 Durban Climate Change Conference and the June 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Grenada appeals to all parties to negotiate seriously and to meet commitments at both of these Conferences. These global meetings must bring added value to the ongoing efforts of Grenada and other developing countries  especially small States. Durban 2011 and Rio+20 must surely deliver meaningful and attainable outcomes  including fulfilling old obligations and delivering on new ones  especially on climate financing and the broader financing for development.     11-51197 10   Developed countries must meet their commitments to poorer nations. At the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Cancún last year we made some progress on climate change and we must build on that. We welcome the establishment of the Transitional Committee of the Green Climate Fund and hope to see it capitalized and fully launched in Durban. We are deeply disappointed that some countries are blocking the mandated review of 1.5 degrees Celsius as the potential global average warming limit. We call on those States to withdraw their objections and support the movement to a safe threshold for islands and for the world. We are convinced that an adequate global response to climate change must remain at the top of the global agenda. A legally binding outcome must be part of the outcome of climate negotiations.  I call on partners to hasten the disbursement of fast-start funds  especially to small island States. These disbursements must be consistent with the scale of the damage already done and the continuing threats that we face from environmental degradation. We express solidarity with our Pacific sisters and brothers  who are daily losing territory to sea-level rise  perhaps faster than we are in the Caribbean. They have my pledge that we will continue to support them.  Naturally  we are taking responsibility for ourselves. This year we are launching a sustainable energy programme for 24 small island developing States. The Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK) will provide the foundation for low carbon economic growth and adaptation to climate change. It will facilitate energy efficiency and provide renewable energy to 24 small island developing States. On behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States I thank the Government and people of Denmark for making the first contribution of an initial US$ 14.5 million to SIDS DOCK. We also thank our partners the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for facilitating the programme. We invite the international community to join Denmark in financing this effort.   In a similar vein to our climate change efforts  we look to the Rio+20 meeting to advance our path to sustainability. One of the key outcomes for Grenada and other SIDS must be the development of a green economy  one that combines investments  jobs and livelihoods with environmental resources; and a blue economy  one that takes into account coastal- and ocean-based income generation. For indeed  peoples’ livelihoods are largely based on environmental resources and services  including agriculture  agro-industries  forestry  mining and tourism. The Rio+20 meeting can and must be a turning point for political commitment and financing for development.  We know that the United Nations is capable of leadership. However  it can be more effective if it anticipates and responds to twenty-first century challenges. That includes recognizing the fact that dozens of mature States  many in the developing world  are ready and able to take responsibility for the management of the global agenda. The United Nations must be reformed. How else will it support its growing agenda? How else can it manage this new global agenda for global sustainability  peace and peacekeeping and disaster response within a democratic multilateral system that is constantly evolving? What worked for 65 years must be reshaped for today. That is why we call for reform of the Security Council to make it more representative and inclusive. Failure to do this will deny that body the political legitimacy it needs to maintain and indeed enhance its leadership role in the world and to make the best decisions. Grenada joins with other member States in the Caribbean Community and calls for expansion of the Security Council in both its permanent and non-permanent categories and more openness in its working methods. We call for a Security Council seat for small island States within a reasonable time frame and we also call for stronger and more enhanced United Nations-CARICOM relations to benefit the people of our Caribbean region.  Grenada welcomes the formation and launch of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  which is aimed at promoting the rights of women and girls and equality between the sexes. That is an early success of United Nations reform.  Grenada is firmly committed to the principle of self-determination. On 14 July Grenada joined with other Member States in welcoming the Republic of South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations. We salute the efforts of its people to usher in peace at home and within the region.  I turn now to the seemingly intractable problem of moving Palestine from a State-in-waiting to an   11 11-51197  internationally recognized State. This cannot be separated from the international clamour for democratic rights now led by the Arab Spring. The just aspirations of the people of Palestine must be addressed  and Palestine must not be left behind in the historical sweep towards open and sustainable democracies. Equally  the Arab Spring should also be the occasion for the renewal of a commitment to Israel’s security. Peace depends on viable democracies and sustained security. That is why Grenada is disappointed that the Palestinians and Israelis have not concluded talks over their long-standing dispute. We urge a return to these talks and look forward to the peaceful coexistence of these two States.  It is quite obvious that the world continues to experience the wrath of nature. We grieve at the waste of human life and the environmental destruction caused by disasters worldwide. We express our solidarity to Member States that have experienced floods  earthquakes  tsunamis and droughts in the past months. Grenada calls for a strong global response especially for the humanitarian crisis now unfolding in the Horn of Africa.  Grenada welcomes the new President of the sister CARICOM State of Haiti and wishes him and his team success as they rebuild Haiti after the devastation of the earthquake. While we thank all those who have helped  much still remains to be done. We call on all who have pledged to help Haiti to deliver on their pledges and support the efforts of the Haitian people. Turning now to another Caribbean concern  Grenada again urges the United States of America to completely lift the harsh economic embargo against the people of Cuba. All but a handful of the United Nations membership have consistently voted for the removal of that embargo.  We acknowledge that responding to the complex and interconnected issues on the United Nations agenda is a major task  even for the United Nations. Nevertheless  responding must be at the top of the United Nations agenda. We maintain support for sustainable development  action on climate change  and support for justice and peace. Grenada commends the Secretary-General for organizing a number of high-level meetings on important topics. We are moved to single out the High-level Meeting on non-communicable diseases. This scourge is negatively affecting not just developing countries but many developed countries as well. The proliferation of non-communicable diseases poses a very serious challenge to small island States like Grenada because of their effects on the labour force and demands on the shrinking finances of the country. We therefore welcome the outcome of the High-level Meeting and we pledge to implement its recommendations.  Finally  last year  building on the conclusion that the United Nations is a real force for good in the world  I challenged the Organization to harness its strength to better achieve that purpose. This year  drawing on the message of youth to make the world a better place  I repeat that call. It is my hope that  under the stewardship of the President  the General Assembly — and the United Nations as a whole — will continue to be the main global force for the good of humanity. Grenada will do its part to advance this singular and inspiring goal."
"71",2922,"GTM",66,2011,"I begin by saluting Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  who presides over the current session. His long experience at the United Nations augurs well for our work.   I also acknowledge the outstanding work of Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  the outgoing President. Our delegation worked very closely with Mr. Deiss  and we can testify to his exceptional commitment to the United Nations and his immense capacity for work.  I also salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I reiterate our appreciation of his management  and congratulate him on his re-election for a second five-year term. I thank him for the support he has given to my country and Central America  shown especially by his recent visit to Guatemala.  My presence at every General Assembly session during the four years of my presidency testifies to our backing for the United Nations and our gratitude for its support.  This occasion is unique  for two reasons.   First  I can tell the Assembly about the achievements of my Administration over the past four years and also about some pending issues. Secondly  I can report that just 10 days ago the first round of general elections was held in my country  in a calm  normal climate with broad citizen participation  thus consolidating our progress towards a democratic and participatory society.  Let me then start with a few words about the progress made in Guatemala  despite the exceptional obstacles created by the international financial crisis of 2008-2009  a severe political crisis in Guatemala in 2009 that was overcome in compliance with the rule of law and truth revealed by investigations  and the impact of three major natural disasters  which led to a 109-day state of emergency  as well as historical challenges that we face now and shall face in the future.    11-50847 2   I shall sum up in a few words the significance of my period in office  as follows.  First  my Administration gave priority to the individual by dealing with social issues that had not been addressed for 50 years. We have tried to reduce poverty and extreme poverty  with tangible results  especially through our social cohesion programmes  particularly conditional transfers of cash to mothers of extremely poor families — more than 940 000 families.  Second  space was recovered for the State in areas previously dominated corporately by private interests.  Third  we began to contain and reverse a shocking escalation of the criminal violence that had started in earlier periods  by reorganizing the security forces and promoting policies that confronted  instead of coexisting with  organized crime.  Fourth  in accordance with those measures  we recovered whole territories previously dominated by drug traffickers  particularly the Mayan biosphere in the northern Department of Petén  consisting of more than 138 000 hectares; 48 000 head of cattle were expelled from the area  and the Government has retaken control of it. Unprecedented seizures of drugs have taken place. In three and a half years we have seized $12 billion  the equivalent of almost two national budgets. By comparison  over the eight-year period before my Government came to power scarcely $1 billion was seized.  However much we do in the Central American region  Mexico and Colombia  it is essential that drug consumption be controlled. Drug-consuming countries must accept co-responsibility for the daily killings in our countries  and for the uncontrolled sales of arms entering it. They must take co-responsibility for the control of money-laundering and of arms  which bring death to our region  and for the control of factories producing chemical precursors for drug production. Responsibility must be taken for the destination of the products and arms.  We cannot control organized crime in Central America without the support of Mexico and Colombia. We can win the battle only if the consumer markets do their share. We cannot go on shedding blood and being wounded by bullets. That is unfair. The consumer markets must assume true co-responsibility.  Fifth  a series of wide-ranging policies was adopted to gain greater transparency. They included the creation of the Secretariat for Transparency and the adoption of a law on public information.  Sixth  the energy matrix was renewed and upgraded to make it more environmentally sound and to counter the effects of the rising cost of hydrocarbons.  Seventh  we promoted two major economic corridors in poverty-stricken regions. In addition  the construction of the Northern Transversal Strip will unite the Mexican State of Chiapas with our neighbour  Honduras  and Polochic.  Eighth  we pursued a dynamic foreign policy  putting the Central American region on a new footing and making possible a closer understanding with our neighbours of Latin America and the Caribbean. I shall return to this matter a little later.  Ninth  municipal power was given full respect and strengthened  being recognized as a fourth power in the democratic system.  Tenth  the independence of the different branches of the State was faithfully respected.  Finally  while everything that I have described was achieved we preserved and improved a solid  stable macroeconomic system. Guatemala is one of the three countries that had no shrinkage of their economy during the financial crisis.  Some important topics require the participation of every State institution; we need legislation by the Congress of the Republic and rulings by the institutions that constitute the country’s judicial system. Among other matters  I wish to refer to the struggle we have waged against impunity  experienced in Guatemala for many years. Seven of the most wanted drug traffickers  who are known to all Guatemalans  are now in jail  awaiting trial. The Government has initiated trials for crimes against humanity committed during our 36-year civil war  which ended in 1996. Sentence has already been passed in some cases  and other trials are continuing.  Here I wish to highlight the crucial role played by the United Nations through the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala  a unique United Nations exercise which enjoys the strong support of not only my Government  but also   3 11-50847  Guatemalan civil society. We are pleased that the Commission’s mandate has been extended for two more years  until September 2013. We recognize the significant achievements it has recorded since its establishment.  Among the main challenges facing us  I wish to mention the following.  First  despite the progress in social matters  we must acknowledge how much remains to be done to eliminate poverty and raise the level of wellbeing of the Guatemalan population. There were many years of neglect  especially of the most vulnerable  such as children  single mothers  and a disproportionate part of the indigenous population.   I am convinced that the actions taken should be institutionalized through social cohesion programmes and presidential programmes. That will require a substantial fiscal transformation to provide the State with the necessary funds. It should be recognized that that is not possible without the support and participation of Congress  even where the Central Government promotes it  as in my case.   In economic matters we need a revival of productive activities in a framework of financial stability and fiscal reform compatible with financing for development.  Secondly  due to our geographical location  Guatemala has become an important transit point for illicit activities  including drug trafficking and human trafficking  both of which are increasingly in the hands of transnational organized crime. We have made strenuous efforts to deal with them and to address the public demand for improved security for every citizen.   It is essential to have regional and international cooperation. Member countries of the Central American Integration System have adopted a historic Central American Security Strategy  which was jointly presented  with the support of the Governments of Colombia and Mexico  to the international community at an international conference held in Guatemala on 22 and 23 June. The main point is that we have acted forcefully  but that it is imperative to implement the 22 projects that need funding.  Here I recall the words of President Calderón of Mexico at the June conference  when he asked what peace there would be in Central America  and Mexico and Colombia  if we were north of Canada; if we simply changed our geographic position we would eliminate the problem of drug trafficking. Once again I stress the co-responsibility of the drug-consuming markets.  Thirdly  it is difficult to promote development when we repeatedly face severe natural disasters  which recently have been occurring at a rate of at least one a year. This can be attributed  at least in part  to climate change  given the high vulnerability of Central America to the effects of this phenomenon. Therefore  it is imperative that humanity close ranks in defence of our common habitat: our planet. So far  progress has been minimal. We urge the international community to redouble efforts to take tangible steps at the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Durban  South Africa  in December.  In my previous statements to the Assembly  I have concluded with references to our foreign policy  especially as it affects  or is impacted by  the United Nations agenda.  My Government has developed an active foreign policy  which includes strengthening the integration process in the framework of the Central American Integration System. We are confident that  as part of that active policy  in some three weeks we shall attain one of our main objectives at the multilateral level — Guatemala’s election by the General Assembly to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the next biennium. This will renew our commitment to the United Nations  and also strengthen our foreign policy  exposing us to a broad and complex diplomatic agenda. We shall carry out our work with responsibility and independence  and with respect for the principles and values enshrined in the Charter.   I thank our regional group  the Latin American and Caribbean Group  for endorsing our candidature  and I thank all Member States in advance for the support that I trust we shall receive when new members are elected to the Security Council.  The central theme of the session is mediation. I reiterate our full commitment to strengthening preventive diplomacy and the instruments that the United Nations possesses to prevent conflicts. In this context  we can even accept sanctions regimes  provided that they come about as a result of collective decisions taken by the Security Council.     11-50847 4   The other side of the coin is that we reject sanctions and coercive measures taken unilaterally. In this regard  we urge the Government of the United States of America to abandon the economic embargo of the Republic of Cuba. We believe that such a step would have many favourable consequences in both countries.   We are following closely  and with hope  the events affecting several countries of North Africa  which will give a greater voice to their peoples. Clearly  it is up to them to decide their own destiny.  But in the midst of the current turbulent situation  it is not possible to delay a solution to the secular conflict resulting from the confrontation between the State of Israel and its neighbours. We support the creation of a viable and prosperous Palestinian State living in peace and harmony  behind secure and defensible borders  side by side with the State of Israel. We understand that the international community can take part in the process of fulfilling that vision  as indeed is happening through the so-called Quartet comprising the United States  the Russian Federation  the European Union and the United Nations  but its realization is up to the two parties — Israel and Palestine — and should be achieved through direct negotiations to resolve all outstanding issues.  We reiterate our commitment to the relaunching of the regional integration process of the Central American Integration System to bring about even closer relations with our neighbours of the Caribbean and Latin America  and we enthusiastically support the creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.  In another crucial area  we regard as an important step towards resolving our age-old territorial dispute with Belize the signing of the Special Agreement  which  when the domestic juridical processes are concluded  will enable both countries to seek a legal solution through the International Court of Justice. I am pleased to report that the Congress of Guatemala has approved the Agreement unanimously. The next step will be to submit it to a national referendum.  In the ancestral Mayan calendar today is the day of balance  the day of dawn  the day that the Guacamaya sings  announcing the coming of a new dawn. Today we have come together to witness a new dawn. It should be the dawn of peace  the dawn of less poverty  the dawn of harmony and above all the dawn of respect for fundamental human rights."
"72",2965,"GUY",66,2011,"Allow me first to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to guide the work of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that under his leadership  Qatar will be instrumental in the service of his presidency  and  indeed  in that of the Assembly as a whole  as we face the challenging times ahead. I also recognize the service of his predecessor and wish to record our appreciation for that service. To our Secretary-General  I offer my delegation’s congratulations on the renewal of his mandate  an act that bears testimony to the confidence placed in him by the Member States of this body.  This is the last time that I will address this great Hall as President of my country. Before the end of the year  I will be proud to be the first President of Guyana to demit office under the constitutional term limits that I signed into law in the early days of my presidency. Inevitably  that milestone has caused me to look back on the changes that have taken place in this body since I first stood here 12 years ago. Three things strike me    11-50702 16  as I reflect on the role of the United Nations over those 12 years.  The first is that the central point that I and others have repeatedly made from this rostrum stays as true today as it was when we first articulated it. The core point is that  while the values that inform the work of the United Nations and our Member States — the values of peace  equality and justice — are timeless  they are of limited use unless we  as the United Nations and as individual Member States  draw on them to catalyse consistent  meaningful and practical responses to the contemporary changing challenges that our peoples face.  The second point that strikes me is how utterly different today’s contemporary challenges actually are when compared with those of just 12 years ago  not to mention those of the 1940s  when the United Nations was founded. The rise of China  India  Brazil and other developing countries is transforming the globe for the better. Billions of people have been lifted out of poverty; new businesses are generating millions of jobs  growth and capital; and there is once again genuine intellectual debate about the right way to embed rights and justice at the core of the global governance structure.  However  the emergence of those great Powers is happening in a totally different way to how Powers emerged in the past. They are emerging in a world that is interconnected through instant communications capabilities and globalized trading and financial systems. What we are witnessing is unlike anything that has happened before  and few communities and no country on the planet are not impacted  almost in real time  by those changes as they happen.  That presents the United Nations and its Member States with a great opportunity to realize our values and to secure the global peace  justice and security to which we aspire. But to do so  we must face up to the opportunities of interconnectedness with responses that are interconnected. Our record on international collective action in recent years is not good.  That leads me to my third point  which is that the search for justice and the achievement of rights for all require us to broaden our traditional understanding of security. We must struggle to achieve rights in a new way and  as many have said before me  alongside the physical security challenge  there are many other aspects to human security and the realization of rights. I think that there are four other elements of security  in particular  that we need to properly understand.  First is the challenge of food security. We are heading for 8 billion  then 9 billion people. Rising prosperity means that those people want greater amounts of  and more nutritious  food. By current trends  we need 100 million hectares of new land by 2020 to meet that demand. How do we do that and avoid excessive price increases and volatility?  Second is the challenge of energy security. As the world gets richer  our demand for energy increases massively. We are likely to demand 36 per cent more energy by 2035. How do we generate the energy needed to meet such demand in a way that helps people everywhere to develop and does not choke off economic growth through high prices caused by energy scarcity?  Third is the challenge of resource security. If we are to alleviate poverty  countries need to develop. And if countries are to develop  they need minerals and other commodities. China alone accounts for more than a third of the demand for many of the most important global commodities  and countries across the world  most notably in South America and Africa  can supply them. How do we help global development by sourcing such minerals and using them efficiently and justly?  Fourth is the challenge of climate security. If we are to avert the biggest economic and social catastrophe ever seen  we must stabilize our planet’s climate. At the absolute limit  that means stabilizing global temperatures at a maximum of two degrees above pre-industrial levels. Yet we are on track towards perhaps a four- or five-degree rise  according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The disaster that this could represent is beyond anyone’s comprehension. And the fact that we are not treating it as an emergency will be viewed by history as the biggest derogation of responsibility by societies and Governments to ever take place. How can we rapidly change that situation before we run out of time?  Those four challenges represent both opportunities and difficulties. The difficulties are obvious  but they are opportunities in the sense that we have enough land  innovation and human ingenuity to feed the world. We have enough clean energy potential to power future prosperity. We have enough resources to provide the foundations for economic growth. We know that to avert climate change means using fossil   17 11-50702  fuels and land in the right way. Once we start realizing those opportunities  we can create new platforms for peace  development and physical security.  That sounds an impossible task  but I would argue that it is not. There are solutions to enable those opportunities to be grasped today  and the United Nations can provide the platform for making the changes that are needed. We can do that if we draw motivation from the realization that the idea of integrated sustainable development  where we optimize our response to the interlinked security challenges  is not some abstraction for environmentalists. It is not a piece of rhetoric about a theoretical better future. Instead  it is an essential and specific call to action that has the potential to be the key global breakthrough of our time. It can change the global paradigm of development in a way that enables us to address the interconnected security challenges we face in the world today.   Pursuing this integrated response to our global challenges presents unparalleled opportunities for peoples across today’s developing world. The food we need  the energy we generate  the minerals and other commodities from which we grow our economies  along with our forests and other land that can be the drivers of climate solutions  are all largely in the developing world. With the right international action  the developing world can lead the globe in the creation of the transformational shift we need to see.   Importantly  within the United Nations  we already have many of the entities we need to solve these problems in an integrated way. That realization should motivate us to understand that by next year’s United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  we can start to make the progress that is necessary.  But that means consistency in our efforts to address all forms of insecurity. We need to support peaceful peoples everywhere to assert their basic rights to physical security and development. The global response to the Arab Spring and other peace movements across the Middle East has been remarkable for its inconsistency. Guyana supports the right of the Palestinian people to full statehood and urges the acceleration of the negotiations to achieve this. Palestinian rights and blood are as valuable and important as those of people everywhere else. I urge all Members to support the draft resolution when it comes before this body.  Guyana was delighted to co-sponsor resolution 65/308 that resulted in the entry of South Sudan into this General Assembly. But we need to do much more. Guyana will be supportive of all peoples who struggle for democracy and dignity.  This also means that we need to rapidly upgrade our response to supporting development  food  energy and resource security. We need to see the Doha trade round not as some zero-sum game between the developed and developing world  but as a critical component to enable the world to meet the urgent challenges that an increasingly prosperous  growing population will present. We need to redouble our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals  and to defeat non-communicable diseases. Guyana therefore welcomes this week’s meeting on non-communicable diseases and the adoption of the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2  annex).  Finally  we need to move beyond the global insanity that is our response to climate insecurity. Existing pledges on greenhouse gas emissions under the Copenhagen Accord will not contain global temperature rises within limits that will avert catastrophic climate change  and some States will face extinction. Moreover  the anaemic delivery on financial pledges made at Copenhagen and formalized in the Cancún agreements is leading to a disastrous breakdown in trust between the developed and developing world. The prospects for reaching an internationally legally binding agreement on climate change at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban  South Africa  would appear rather bleak. There is therefore an urgent need for high-order political leadership to re-energize the climate change process and deliver credible results.  To address these challenges  the United Nations and other international institutions need to modernize fast  and the international system needs to correct the inconsistencies between aid  trade and climate policies as I have outlined. In part  this means making the Security Council more democratic  transparent and legitimate. Fifty-four African countries have no permanent seat on the Council; neither do the 33 countries that comprise the Latin American and Caribbean region. Guyana strongly supports early    11-50702 18  reform of the Security Council through an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories and enhanced representation of developing countries.  Today’s developed world needs to catch up with the realization that the world has changed  and it is in its vital national interests to change its approach to development issues. Food security is not just about people in poor countries; prices in Europe and the United States are rising too. Energy insecurity will hit today’s developed countries and destroy their competitiveness as rapidly as it will hit the developing world. Resource insecurity is already driving up imported inflation in many developed countries and elsewhere. Climate insecurity could be the tipping point for today’s Powers to be relegated to history  with all the suffering that would entail for their peoples.  So the narrative is changing and I hope that we will rise to the challenge. From now on  I will watch the proceedings in this Hall from afar  but for all of my invocations to the United Nations to do better  it remains the place where noble ambitions are pursued. I wish the United Nations and its Members all the best for a secure  prosperous and socially just future. On behalf of my country and people  I express our full support for the Organization and for strengthening its capacity to better fulfil the many mandates entrusted to it. "
"73",3010,"HND",66,2011,"For Honduras  it is a source of great satisfaction to participate in this important session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Honduran people  I should like at the outset to express our great pleasure at the re-appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon for another term as Secretary-General. I also wish to convey to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  Mr. Joseph Deiss  my greatest respect for the contribution he made to this global forum through the fruitful work achieved under his leadership. We also congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser upon his election as President of the General Assembly.  I congratulate the State of South Sudan on having become the newest Member of the United Nations.  It is also timely to reaffirm my decisive commitment as a leader to this Organization  which represents the best forum for addressing and resolving the problems facing the world in the quest for the common welfare of humankind based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I reaffirm our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and in particular to the principle that we are all free and equal in dignity and rights. This concept includes peoples and nations alike. Over and above geopolitical interests  the self-determination of peoples is inviolable and inalienable. All peoples have the right to their own territory  cultural identity and traditions.  In this context  my Government has recognized Palestine as a State and endorses its legitimate aspiration to become a full member in the concert of nations. Full security for the State of Israel and full international recognition for Palestine are essential conditions for a comprehensive negotiated two-State solution providing for strong and lasting peace through mutual understanding. If we want peace  we must recall that peace is based on respect not only for human rights  but also for the rights of peoples and nations.  With regard to my country  Honduras  I must say that the political crises it suffered and the coup d’état of 28 June 2009 led to a deterioration in the human rights situation. Overcoming it is one of our highest priorities. Since I took office in January 2010  my task has been to build unity and reconciliation among the Honduran people through peacebuilding founded on social justice. That process of reconciliation and    11-50702 2  democracy-building in our country has enjoyed the constructive support of the international community as a whole.   I take this opportunity to express my particular thanks for the mediation efforts of Presidents Juan Manuel Santos Calderón of Colombia and Hugo Chávez Frías of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  which led to the signing of the Cartagena Agreement  which in turn facilitated the return of Honduras to the Organization of American States.   We have demonstrated by our actions that there is no State policy to violate human rights in Honduras; on the contrary  we work every day to promote a culture of respect for human rights based on ongoing dialogue with all sectors of society  with special attention to those sectors that have generally been deprived of the right to participate. We are building a participatory democracy  derived from the principle that all social groups have the full and legitimate right to take part in our history.   We have a secretariat for justice and human rights to advise on relevant policies. With the participation of civil society organizations  the secretariat is enthusiastically working on developing our country’s first public human rights policy and a national action plan on human rights. It is also following the recommendations made by the Human Rights Council to Honduras during the Universal Periodic Review. In line with those aspirations  in July our Truth and Reconciliation Commission — having worked in absolute legitimacy and transparency — completed its fully independent mandate and presented the people of Honduras with its report and recommendations so as to ensure that such things never happen again and to foment reconciliation within the Honduran family. We are taking the necessary steps to implement those recommendations.   At the same time  faced with the global crisis that resulted from serious problems in developed economies  we have met with trade unions  entrepreneurs  workers  farmers  civil society and political parties to reach an overall national agreement that will enable us to face the challenges that the crisis created in our country. Our Honduran response has been to propose a social pact to establish conditions propitious for economic growth  employment  appropriate remuneration and productivity. The national plan for the next 28 years is under way. We are empowering our citizens. The optimum Government we can shape is comprised of a people who themselves want to develop within a framework of equitable economic growth.  Alongside that overall national agreement  all sectors and stakeholders in the field of education are reaching agreement on wide-reaching educational reform in Honduras to propel a dynamic education administration guaranteeing equal opportunity for all  especially those who have the least.  In the social sphere  we have a family assistance programme with conditional monetary benefits. More than 400 000 families have received such payments  and by 2013 we hope to reach 600 000 families  representing 50 per cent of families in Honduras. The condition is that children go to school and that parents attend child-nutrition programmes.   In September 2010  along with President Johnson Toribiong of Palau  we called upon heads of State of United Nations Member States to save sharks  stop the traffic in shark fins and put an end to global overfishing of the species. I repeat that plea with the same passion today.   Although our country does not contribute much to greenhouse gas emissions  we have signed many international treaties and conventions that aim to guarantee the planet’s security and climate for its inhabitants in the context of the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. Beyond those important conventions  today we will sign the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.   Honduras reiterates its strong approval of all measures to protect and conserve natural resources and the environment  based on the principles agreed upon 20 years ago. We ask the States Member of the United Nations to renew those past commitments and to draw up national policies so that we can build our capacities and establish mechanisms that respond to the needs of the population.  Although it is not enough in itself  my Government has made significant progress in promoting the just historical claims  rights and profile of indigenous peoples and people of African descent. In accordance with the Durban Declaration and Plan of Action  we have adopted public policies to work   3 11-50702  towards those commitments. Among them I would mention our ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  the institution of an African Heritage Month in Honduras  and the creation and inauguration of a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples and People of African Descent.   I note that the United Nations  through General Assembly resolution 64/169  proclaimed 2011 the International Year for People of African Descent. In that context  civil society members of African descent  in cooperation with the Organization for Ethnic Community Development convened and celebrated the First World Summit of People of African Descent in August  amply supported by my Government  other Governments  international partners and United Nations system bodies. One of my Government’s aspirations is to complete our constitutional reform to define Honduras as a multi-ethnic  multicultural country.   My Government joins its voice to those of millions of people of African descent in calling for the United Nations to institute a decade for people of African descent beginning in 2012  create a development fund for people of African descent  and establish a permanent forum for peoples of African descent within the United Nations.  Before concluding  I would like to raise an issue that is one of the greatest and most important challenges that our region faces: citizen insecurity. The most recent analysis carried out by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank show that Central America has become the region in the world with the highest levels of violence and organized crime. Their economic impact has escalated in the past decade to reach  in the case of Honduras  a level close to 10 per cent of our gross domestic product.   Violence and transnational organized crime  primarily evident in the commission of crimes such as drug trafficking  kidnapping  murder  money and asset laundering  people trafficking  arms trafficking  the commercial sexual exploitation of women and minors  among other crimes  are a serious threat to our possibilities to create well-being. Without security  there is no economic growth or development.  The evidence shows that many of those crimes  from the organized crime and lack of security to which they give rise and that prevail in our societies  have their roots in the use and trafficking of drugs. Owing to their very nature and to the sums of money involved  they have a serious impact on our societies and add to the erosion of our system of values. They steal our young people  destroy conviviality and community life and create parallel economic systems that are true enclaves of crime  violence and degradation.   Today  the countries of the region invest huge amounts of money in combating the production and trafficking of drugs. However  practically the only instances in which the production and trafficking of drugs significantly drop in a region occur as a result of a change in routes or production being in other areas. Given that demand in developing countries has not decreased  the strategy that we follow in the region today  in the best case scenario  has only a partial and limited impact on the trafficking  transport and use of drugs.   For that reason  we note that  first of all  a pilot project that we have put to the United Nations should be launched to strengthen the capacity for the investigation and trial of organized crime in Honduras. Secondly  we need to gather together all the strategies that were discussed at the International Conference in Support of the Central America Security Strategy on 22 and 23 June in Guatemala. We should also point out  and it must be reaffirmed  that consumer countries must act bravely and resolutely in order to reduce or eliminate the use of and the trade in drugs because we must realize that without that  it will be very difficult for our societies to end the scourge. We must succeed in aligning our strategies so as to end the drug scourge and organized crime.   I would like to end by expressing my best wishes for this sixty-sixth session to meet the expectations of all Member States  which  I am sure  are founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of States."
"74",3035,"HRV",66,2011,"It is a distinct pleasure for me to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly for the first time since my election as President of Croatia.  At the outset  I would like to congratulate Ambassador Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly in its sixty-sixth session. I also thank Joseph Deiss for his excellent work during his presidency of the General Assembly in the preceding session.  Let me also congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to that important and challenging post and assure him of the full cooperation of my country.  Current challenges — the fall of autocratic regimes  nuclear non-proliferation  terrorism  the continuing global financial and economic crisis  climate change  underdevelopment — require all of us here at the United Nations to firmly stand together and offer common solutions on the basis of solidarity  responsibility and respect for the rights and dignity of every person on the globe. Our responses to challenges must not remain just words. We need to translate them into concrete actions  aimed at advancing democracy  enhancing development and well-being  protecting human rights  respecting international law  ensuring    11-50871 32  social justice and promoting the rule of law  at the domestic  regional and international levels.  I welcome the President’s decision to hold this debate under the theme of “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes”. Mediation has rightly been recognized as an efficient and cost-effective tool  which the United Nations has at its disposal in addressing threats to the maintenance of international peace and security. Political issues often lie at the heart of crises. Therefore  the importance of early engagement and preventive diplomacy  including mediation  is even more significant in this period when United Nations peacekeeping operations are experiencing unprecedented demand and strain.  My country has come a long way since the conflict in the 1990s  when Croatia hosted a total of five United Nations peacekeeping operations on its territory. We have developed a stable democracy and a free-market economy  and we serve as an anchor of peace  security and stability in the region of South-East Europe.  That experience and the lessons learned have been the backdrop for our engagement in the Security Council  where Croatia has proved to be a responsible and dedicated partner in the common effort to maintain and build peace. We intend to pursue efforts with the same vigour in the Peacebuilding Commission  the Economic and Social Council and other United Nations bodies for which Croatia is a candidate.  When all efforts to avoid conflict fail  the international community turns as a rule to the United Nations to stop the hostilities and maintain peace. Croatia will continue its engagement in peacekeeping operations under United Nations auspices. But keeping the peace is not enough. In countries emerging from conflict  peace needs to be strengthened and consolidated.   Croatia has  in a relatively short time  effectively transitioned from a donor-recipient to a donor-provider. Today we share our knowledge and experiences with countries in the region  as well as with other countries in crisis  where our post-conflict experience in nation-building is particularly relevant. My country  working together with other Member States and the United Nations as a whole — and acting with the same enthusiasm and spirit that clearly characterized the international community’s ambitions almost six years ago when the Peacebuilding Commission was established — stands ready to play its part in the revival of the peacebuilding architecture and thorough implementation of its core functions.  Croatia has completed its accession negotiations with the European Union (EU) and expects to become a full member in 2013. Once it joins the EU  Croatia will consistently advocate further EU enlargement and will not use its outstanding bilateral issues to set conditions for the progress of individual countries in the process of their integration with the EU.  I have held numerous meetings with my counterparts in the region  in particular the Presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In our meetings  we have discussed the continuation of the reconciliation process  the resolution of outstanding issues among the three States and our mutual political support. Croatia has pledged technical assistance in the process of integration into the European Union and has stressed the need to jointly define regional networks of infrastructure systems and submit them as regional projects for funding from EU funds.  As a member of NATO and a future member of the EU  we have a keen interest to see South-East Europe become a region of security  stability and development. That may not happen overnight  but I firmly believe that with sustained effort and targeted actions by all politicians and peoples  the region will lose its negative reputation as an arena of political fragmentation often accompanied by bloodshed  and will deservedly become known as an area where good-neighbourly relations  tolerance and mutual cooperation prevail  thus making it a European success story of peacebuilding and reconciliation.  However  without justice  efforts to ensure true reconciliation and sustainable peace may be unable to take root firmly. Croatia strongly supports determined efforts to put an end to impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to humanity and  in that context  reaffirms its commitment to international criminal justice in general and to the activities of the International Criminal Court in particular.  Croatia supports the main purpose and primary functions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)  namely  the establishment of a lasting peace and reconciliation. Croatia appreciates the efforts to implement the ICTY completion strategy and its transformation towards residual mechanisms. Full cooperation with the ICTY   33 11-50871  and respect for international justice are a lasting commitment for us  not only in the context of the Euro-Atlantic integration processes  but also as an expression of Croatia’s core values and its role in the international community. We greatly appreciate the legacy of the ICTY  especially its contribution to international law  justice and reconciliation. That legacy has already improved national judiciaries in the region through its promotion of high standards of criminal responsibility for breaches of humanitarian law. Further development of international law  both international and national judiciaries and a better understanding of justice will be based on this positive legacy  but also on the lessons learned from some of the ICTY’s weaknesses.  Future development of international criminal law should consider improving the efficiency of international courts and of State cooperation  as well as instituting a critical evaluation of some procedural and substantive laws. In that regard  we should consider more efficient measures to be taken in cases of non-cooperative States  the position of victims and their compensation  and the protection of witnesses  as well as the concept of joint criminal enterprise  and others.  The protection of fundamental rights and freedoms must be ensured when addressing very serious security challenges  such as international terrorism. Croatia strongly supports the values and objectives of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  since it confirms that the United Nations is at the centre of global counter-terrorism efforts. We had the privilege of chairing the Counter-Terrorism Committee during Croatia’s membership in the Security Council  and we are willing to share our knowledge and experience with others  in the region and beyond.  The Arab Spring  which is rooted in the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people for improved economic opportunities and political participation  has just moved into summer  but its democratic gains must be preserved if we do not want to see another relapse into instability. I believe that the course of recent events in Libya has clearly confirmed that the coalition forces and the Security Council took the right approach in protecting civilians from the brute force of the old regime. I hope that the democratic forces in Libya will begin to build a new State that will provide the same level of protection and equal opportunities for all Libya’s citizens. It is crucial to work towards establishing the rule of law throughout the country. We trust that the National Transitional Council will succeed in achieving that goal. My country is ready to participate in Libya’s reconstruction  especially given its experience in post-conflict nation- and institution-building. Taking into account new political and humanitarian priorities in the field  Croatia has sent targeted humanitarian assistance to Libya  with an emphasis on medical and humanitarian needs.  In the same vein  Croatia has recognized the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people  who need and deserve wide and undivided support. We share the international community’s belief that it is essential to normalize the situation and prevent further mass violations of human rights  strengthen democratic standards and the rule of law  and assist those who share the vision of a democratic Syria.  Croatia shares the sense of urgency concerning the importance of securing an early resumption and conclusion of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations  aimed at achieving a two-State solution. The current unprecedented and deep changes in the political landscape of the Middle East call for urgent and highly responsive action by all parties concerned. Mutual recognition — Israel’s recognition of a Palestinian State and Palestine’s recognition of the Jewish State — constitutes both the starting point and the desired outcome of peace negotiations. Failure to move forward on a two-State solution now may have unpredictable negative consequences  not only for Israel and Palestine  but for the whole international community. Given our recent experience of war and reconciliation  Croatia calls on the leaders of the parties concerned to shoulder their historic responsibility for the future of their peoples and for peace and stability in the Middle East.  Recently  we witnessed an example of a new State being created in a generally peaceful manner  and I welcome South Sudan as the newest Member of the United Nations. However  this and many other ongoing crises  in the Sudan  Somalia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other places  confirm the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in ending conflicts; and in this context mediation  as the theme of our debate  becomes even more relevant.  Croatia continues to promote universal human rights and supports the mainstreaming of human rights    11-50871 34  within the United Nations framework. In that context  we give particular attention to issues such as the abolition of the death penalty  gender equality and combating all forms of discrimination  as well as the promotion of the human rights of the most vulnerable social groups  including women  children and persons with disabilities. Croatia strongly supports the concepts of the universality  interrelatedness and indivisibility of all human rights.  Croatia welcomes the establishment of UN-Women  the new United Nations body focused on supporting gender equality and the empowerment of women. Croatia also supports relevant initiatives on the rights of lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender persons and will continue to be actively engaged in the follow-up process to the 2008 joint statement on human rights  sexual orientation and gender identity (see A/63/PV.70).  In response to dramatic changes in the world in the last few decades  comprehensive reforms of the United Nations system as a whole have been put forward. Those proposals include structural reform and improvements in the way United Nations bodies function  as well as revitalization of the General Assembly. Although there are many important elements in this process  reforming the Security Council remains essential. Croatia believes that the Security Council must adequately represent the current structure of the membership of the United Nations. We therefore support enlarging the Security Council in both permanent and non-permanent membership categories. Taking into consideration that the number of members of the Eastern European Group has almost doubled  Croatia proposes that one seat be added for the Group in the non-permanent category. Croatia is also aware of the importance of resolving all the other elements of Security Council reform.  As we witness the increasing challenges appearing around the world  it is clear that we must all make every effort to strengthen the capability  efficiency and credibility of the United Nations in general. We welcome the establishment of the Change Management Team  and look forward to seeing proposals for streamlining processes  increasing accountability and improving the efficiency of the United Nations in delivering its mandates.  The challenges and consequences of climate change are undermining efforts to achieve sustainable development. Climate change must be further mainstreamed into the work of the whole United Nations system  with a view to supporting efforts to help the transition to low-carbon economies consistent with sustainable development  to strengthen countries’ adaptation and resilience in the face of climate change  and to minimize the possible security implications.  In the light of diminishing natural resources  environmental degradation  extreme poverty  hunger and diseases  and social unrest  we agree with others that sustainable development has become the defining issue of our time. Our highly globalized and interdependent world means that we share not only the same challenges but a common fate. As a member of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee  Croatia will be an active contributor to the preparations for next year’s United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  the Rio+20 Conference. This summit meeting will provide a unique opportunity to reinvigorate the spirit of Rio and to restate a blueprint for political commitment  partnership and action on the ground without revisiting the agreements reached at Rio in 1992 or at Johannesburg in 2002.  Finally  let me return to what this Organization stands for. In order to achieve our common objectives  we must demonstrate unity of purpose  firm resolve  solidarity and responsibility. Or  as a famous composer once said  “Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.” "
"75",3080,"HTI",66,2011,"First of all  I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I also want to use this occasion to commend the leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to laud the dynamism and wisdom he brings to the management of world affairs.   From this rostrum  I extend a brotherly welcome to our sister nation  South Sudan  which just proclaimed its independence on 9 July. We share in their pride  and we welcome them with great respect as the 193rd Member State of the great family of the United Nations. On behalf of the Republic of Haiti  I send warm congratulations and our hope that the country may enjoy peace  happiness and prosperity. I honour the memory of those who died in the struggle before seeing the dawn of a new day shining in that part of the African continent.  Speaking here today on behalf of Haiti  I join my voice with those of all the Member States that  like us  have known the heavy burden of post-disaster and post-conflict circumstances  in saying that even among the weakest and most vulnerable hope lives on. They carry the hope of rebirth  because they know that the pre-crisis reality is no longer a possibility. They know that change — change in their mentality and change in their political  economic and social affairs — must be their creed. They cannot afford not to change. In the case of Haiti  it is precisely because an entire people were firmly convinced of the need for change that I was elected with a very clear mandate  namely  that of bringing about that change.   I am convinced that that leap in awareness that resulted from suffering is what will lead to a new global order. That was the case at the beginning of the nineteenth century  when Saint-Domingue broke its chains and brought about the birth of Haiti. It was the case in 1945  when countries of good will  including Haiti  came together to bring about this body which brings us together this week around noble ideals. It also seems to be the case in the light of the political changes affecting North Africa.  In a country of the South where the human development index is still of concern  a major disaster unfortunately arises  the great question of responsibility comes brutally to the fore again  whether the responsibility be local in terms of governance  or whether the responsibility lies with the global order. Today’s world and the United Nations in particular will be more and more called upon  because those post-disaster situations include both situations resulting from natural disasters and those of a passing nature or those that are simply caused by human folly.   When on top of that  in some of those cases  all of these factors come together  the response must be   21 11-51191  more carefully designed  more responsible  more coordinated  bolder and more determined.   I strongly believe that  first of all  it is for the affected countries to seek and find solutions  because any solution that is imposed from the outside  however generous it might be  will  in the medium term  only produce adverse effects. It is up to the people of the South to determine how they use their wealth  their raw materials and their future. In the case of Haiti  I have to say that the international community  through the United Nations  showed by supporting  six months after the earthquake  presidential elections in a difficult context  that it understood the urgency. I would like to thank it for that.  But I also strongly believe that it would be irresponsible for a country that has been hit by disaster to deny itself the assistance  expertise and cooperation of sisterly nations  whether they be from the emerging South or from the North  which is supposedly well-off.  It is that balance  as I was saying  between mature governance and well-conceived international assistance that should be sought after and codified  genuinely and without any embellishment. I would cite as an example the various peacekeeping and stabilization missions of the United Nations in numerous places around the globe  including Haiti.   The same situation arises everywhere: a country initially welcomes the missions  but in the medium term  they lose steam. Why? Problems arise because the expectations of the host country are excessive. Furthermore  missions cannot operate when they work under inflexible terms of reference. That is to be regretted  because nothing would more irresponsible and dangerous than to let missions leave before an effective national alternative is in place.   In the case of Haiti  what would the United Nations Mission have accomplished if today  suddenly and without any warning  it were to be withdrawn? Of course  I am aware of the fact that unacceptable errors have been committed and have affected the prestige of the Mission  but the trees must not be allowed to hide the forest. I believe that political stabilization goes through a number of stages. It cannot be based simply on an intervention force or a more or less neutral observer presence. That would reflect a very simplified view of the primary role of the United Nations. Stabilization is more than that. Thus  the Government policy that I stand for consists of four main pillars: education  employment  environment and the rule of law.   How can we build peace unless there is universal and free basic education in a country where there is massive illiteracy? How can we promote sustainable development without high quality education that promotes citizen values  ensures gender equality  values cultural identity and openness to the world  and leads to tolerance?  With respect to jobs  allow me to say that we can talk as much as we like about human dignity and human rights  and about stabilization and peace  but an empty stomach is deaf to words. It is by creating decent jobs that are properly paid and that respect the rights of vulnerable categories of people that justice begins. It is by a fair distribution of the income from raw materials that we will stop smothering the countries of the South and put an end to the speculation that undermines democracy.   On these major themes  nations must come together and come still closer together. They must be committed to combating deforestation and climate change. We must also seriously take into account the problem of water. There will be no peace in the world as long as the living conditions of countries such as mine are so poor that they lead to natural disasters becoming even more tragic  floods even worse  drought even more deadly and the rural exodus even more widespread.   Stabilization today also means  above all  establishing the rule of law  but the rule of law requires  inter alia  an independent  responsible and strong justice system. It also means the ongoing and difficult but necessary establishment of strong institutions that are stronger than privilege and group interest.   The world will become more beautiful when we stop talking about condemning or accusing people. Haiti has been witness to that fact. But Haiti can also say that in post-disaster assistance  the disbursement of funds that are not subject to inflexible  complex and clumsy red tape are those that are best adapted to needs. Therefore  those procedures  even if they are supported  allow the affected countries to take ownership of the strategic initiatives concerning their future. Specifically  in terms of the resources made available to the affected populations  it is also desirable    11-51191 22  that pledges be followed up with action and that reconstruction projects be actually implemented.   In a word  I would say that it would be very sad to see the left hand taking back what the right hand had given. The temptation exists; it is the result of a difficult global economic context. But  once again  truth alone must prevail  because when reconstruction is left to wait  the long wait can lead to impatience and bring harm. In the case of Haiti  as in other post-conflict situations  the United Nations and friendly nations should come to our aid to help us to reconstruct more than just a physical space  but reconstruct men and women  to whom we must give hope. Beyond concepts and abstractions  this is above all a human story. This is the new order we are here to speak of today: putting human beings back into the heart of the central debates of our time. This is the momentum in which we are caught up and which is shared by billions of people in the grip of disasters  forced exoduses  conflicts and epidemics.   In solidarity with those other victims  the Haitian people wish to send a very clear message from the platform of the United Nations. As long as there are men and women of good will  there will be hope. As long as there are nations united in solidarity  there will be hope. We in Haiti have experienced every conceivable kind of catastrophe: every form of man-made disaster and all the natural ones  aggravated by the systematic  irresponsible destruction committed by human beings. We have known epidemics and hunger  even marginalization  but Haiti is now back on its feet  ready to rebuild and ready for a new start. Nothing is predetermined. It is this new Haiti that is open to the world  this new Haiti that is open to new investments and collaborations  to reconstruction  dialogue and peace. And it is this new Haiti that says thank you to all those assembled here."
"76",3126,"HUN",66,2011,"Let me at the outset welcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations. I commend the successful conduct of the referendum on independence as a manifestation of the principle of self-determination. That historic act has put an end to a long civil war on the African continent and opened up new horizons for the stability and prosperity of the people of South Sudan.  Hungary fully aligns itself with the statement made earlier by President Van Rompuy on behalf of the European Union. To complement this  allow me to outline my country’s position on three issues figuring high on our foreign policy and development agenda  namely  the Arab Spring  sustainable development and the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.  More than 20 years ago  Central and Eastern Europe  including my country  Hungary  was the scene of sweeping political changes. Beginning in early 2011  the world has witnessed  yet again  the outburst of popular will for profound transformation  this time in North Africa and the Middle East. Those of us who took active part in the democratization process and the transition to the rule of law and market economies in our region have been following the events of the Arab Spring with great empathy and understanding.   The revolutions leading to sweeping shifts in Tunisia  Egypt and other countries were equally driven by sincere desires for a better life and for putting in place new political systems capable of better responding to the aspirations of all parts of society. The voices of Tahrir Square echoed the aspirations of millions of people.  The overthrow of autocratic regimes is  nevertheless  only the first step in that direction. As shown by our own experience  the most difficult stages of the transformation process are yet to come. The victorious popular uprisings of the Arab Spring have encountered tremendous challenges in terms of establishing new power structures  drafting new constitutions and other basic laws  as well as conducting free and democratic elections  just to mention a few. Essentially those measures require an    11-51191 2  internally driven process  carried out with the support of the international community.  Hungarian society has  on the one hand  already successfully met many of those challenges and  on the other hand  made some avoidable mistakes. We therefore feel equipped to share our experiences and to offer a substantive toolkit for good governance and democratic change. As a good friend and supporting partner  Hungary truly hopes that those undergoing transitional periods today will be able to benefit from both our achievements and our omissions.  Far be it from us  of course  to try to give advice or provide ready-made solutions. While we advocate the universal character of human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as the virtues of the rule of law and good governance  we believe that those ideals can be implemented only in conjunction with respect for the cultural  religious and other traditions of each nation.  At this stage of what we see as a long transformation process in the Arab world  we thus offer to share our own experiences and lessons learned. The Hungarian Government  in cooperation with non-governmental organizations  has already carried out  and plans to carry out in future  concrete projects and programmes aimed at  inter alia  assisting the new emerging democracies in North Africa and the Middle East in the field of institution-building  security-sector reform  and drawing up the legislative framework for political and economic renewal. We welcome the central role and increasing involvement of the United Nations and its various agencies in support of the democratization of those countries. Hungary stands ready to contribute to such efforts and provide its specialized expertise.  Over the past two decades  since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  the three pillars of sustainable development have been the focus of the international development agenda. Time has shown that only a coherent approach to the environmental  economic and social aspects of this concept can ensure the long-term survival and prosperity of mankind. We should not miss this chance to formulate new courses of action in this era of reinforced mutual interdependence and globalization.  Against the background of the constantly deteriorating global environment  it is an increasingly demanding task to strike the necessary balance between ensuring growth in all regions of the world  a decent life for our societies and the preservation of natural resources in the interests of the survival of our planet. One of the responses to this dilemma is the concept of a green economy  which is gaining ever-greater support. We consider the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development as a unique event aimed at generating the widest possible support for and acceptance of this green concept. Its goal is to support the sustainability of socio-economic development at the national  regional and global levels.   In addition  the concept of a green economy has the potential to also contribute to job creation and the eradication of poverty. If implemented in a coherent manner  it will create new resources for achieving the internationally agreed development goals. There is no doubt that achieving these goals will require innovative thinking in terms of technology transfer  investment and fair trade.  In order to put this concept into practice  a reorganization of the environmental architecture of the United Nations is needed. Such reform should pursue the goal of streamlining and unifying the existing structures  with a view to increasing the coherence and efficiency of the system as a whole.  It is our shared responsibility to develop joint strategies to mitigate the effects of non-communicable diseases. Their rapid growth is preventable and can be controlled to a significant extent. Hungary has been in the forefront of this fight  with national cancer and diabetes control systems in place that may contribute to paving the way for functional alternatives around the world. It is also our fundamental belief that the development of comprehensive national and regional strategies for control programmes can significantly lower the incidence of these illnesses. This can contribute to prevention  early detection and adequate treatment in a cost-effective way. We are also proud of Hungary’s long-standing tradition of sharing knowledge and providing educational and training programmes for students and experts from all over the world. In the past decades  hundreds of students from outside Hungary have obtained their medical degrees in our country. We are cooperating with various countries  sharing knowledge and experiences in order to contribute to the collective efforts that need to be made to bring about better health worldwide.  The High-level Meeting gave momentum to this fight  which needs to be fought not only on an   3 11-51191  individual level by the victims of these diseases  but also by our countries and by the international community working together. We need to capitalize on this in order to reach the ultimate goal of saving lives around the world and thereby move further towards one of the founding objectives of the United Nations: human development.  As members may know  Hungary has put forward its candidacy for Security Council membership in 2012-2013. We continue to uphold the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law  such as the equality of nations  the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights. Hungary also stands ready to contribute in a meaningful way to all efforts aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the United Nations in the field of conflict prevention and mediation. We believe in an integrated approach to conflict resolution and will advocate a stronger integration of security and development concerns  as well as enhanced interaction between the Council and other main organs of the United Nations.  Let me conclude by assuring the Assembly once again that Hungary will continue to contribute its utmost to strengthening the global cooperation of countries within the United Nations system  which is so strongly needed to tackle today’s challenges."
"77",3173,"IDN",66,2011,"Allow me  Sir  to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to preside over the Assembly at the sixty-sixth session. Let me also commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his leadership in guiding us over the Assembly’s sixth-fifth session. May I take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment.  Indonesia would also like to welcome South Sudan as a Member of the United Nations.   Our world continues to be full of challenges  political and military tensions and conflicts  as well as threats of nuclear weapons and of acts of piracy and terrorism. There is the financial and economic crisis. Worse and more fundamental still  in many corners of the world there is abject poverty and hunger  environmental threats and natural disasters  energy and food insecurity  intolerance and discrimination. There are authoritarian regimes bent on suppressing the clamour for democracy and respect for human rights.  We believe that in convening in this historic Hall  as we do every year  we must seek more than simply to review the past year  to lament opportunities lost and to congratulate ourselves on the gains made. Rather  we must ensure that  moving forward  as nations we stand united — United Nations — in addressing and anticipating the challenges ahead.   In particular  we must stand united in transforming challenges into opportunities for nations to forge mutually beneficial partnerships  anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter. We must change challenges into opportunities to promote a new kind of international relations that accentuates partnership rather than confrontation  and that places primacy on the building of bridges rather than the deepening of fault lines and divisions  and on nations aggressively waging peace and development.  Waging peace and development in the Middle East must  first and foremost  entail correcting the historic injustice to the Palestinian people that has been allowed for too long. Indonesia’s support for the legitimate aspirations and rights of the people of Palestine to live in freedom  peace  justice and dignity in their own homeland has been steadfast and will continue unabated.  Indonesia therefore strongly supports Palestine’s present quest for full membership in the United Nations. Such membership is consistent with the vision of the two-State solution and of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Indeed  the recent heightened worldwide focus on the issue of Palestine can  and must  be channelled in a constructive way towards the promotion of an inclusive partnership among nations that leads to the fulfilment of the historic responsibilities shouldered by our United Nations.  The continued denial of the most basic rights of the Palestinian people becomes all the more glaring in the face of the welcome democratic transformation that is under way in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. Like many  Indonesia has been deeply concerned by the untold losses and casualties suffered by innocent civilians. The bloodshed and use of force must be brought to an immediate end  for  ultimately  political solutions must be found. That means that conditions conducive for people to shape their own future must be promoted. Thus in Libya  for example  Indonesia    11-51390 28  supports the National Transitional Council in its efforts to promote a peaceful and democratic transition.  A decade or so ago now  Indonesia too went through a tumultuous process of democratic change. Today  as the third largest democracy  Indonesia is reaping the democratic dividends of such change. That is why we believe that political development and democratization should constitute a priority item on our agenda  to allow States to share lessons learned and experiences in their unique paths towards democratization. That is why we took the initiative of launching the Bali Democracy Forum — the only intergovernmental forum for the sharing of experience and cooperation on political development in Asia. It is a forum for partnership in the promotion of democracy.  Global partnership is particularly key in addressing the challenges of development in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to prevent the recurrence of famine  which we are currently witnessing in the Horn of Africa. Thus we must act in concert and in a focused and sustainable way to ensure food security for the most vulnerable. That means increased investment in the agricultural research and development sector and increased production and productivity.  I wish to highlight one particular driver of economic growth and development. An enhanced role for women in the economy is not only right  but also smart  leading to both increased growth and more balanced  sustainable and equitable growth.  Achieving food security also requires that we confront the reality of climate change. The international community must find the political commitment to generate momentum for climate change  towards a new climate regime after 2012. The forthcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in Durban and the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil next year must deliver.  However  let us not wait. In Indonesia  we are committed to being proactive and to being part of the global solution to climate change. Through the REDD-plus programme — Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation — we are using our natural rainforests as an important part of our mitigation efforts.  Our commitment to work in partnership in addressing climate change must not founder before the looming and renewed threat of the global financial and economic crisis. In the face of that challenge  we must take bold measures. The reform of international financial and economic governance must be expedited. Enhanced coordination of national economic policies is essential. We must learn to step out of our comfort zone and address those critical needs in concert. As emerging economies are now an important engine of global economic growth  they must have a greater opportunity to contribute to promoting solutions.  The challenges confronting us are persistent and formidable  but we have the opportunity and the capacity to address them and  most of all  to turn challenges into opportunities. For a start  since those challenges defy national solutions  they can at the same time motivate countries to strike partnerships and build cooperation. In that regard  allow me to highlight two basic points.  First  we need to strengthen multilateralism in order to address global challenges. That means the central role of the United Nations. To be able to address new and emerging challenges  and  not least  to identify new opportunities  full support for and reform of the United Nations are key. That is the only way that the United Nations can remain relevant and to ensure that multilateralism flourishes.  Through reform  we must ensure that the United Nations and its decision-making processes are more effective  efficient  transparent and inclusive. We must persevere in strengthening the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and their subsidiary organs  as well as the Human Rights Council. We must support the Peacebuilding Commission as it helps countries emerging from conflict.  The Security Council must better reflect the current world situation. It should become more representative  more transparent and  thus  more effective. All key issues of United Nations reform should be addressed as integral parts of a comprehensive package.  Secondly  cooperation and partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations are key to addressing today’s global challenges. Thus  there should be synergy between global and regional efforts. That is particularly true in conflict prevention and resolution  linked to the theme of this year’s General   29 11-51390  Assembly session  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”.  In South-East Asia  as Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Indonesia has worked ceaselessly to develop the region’s capacity to prevent and to manage potential conflicts  and to resolve them. Our efforts have been focused not only on the further development of ASEAN’s conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms  but also on developing and nurturing the necessary comfort level among ASEAN member States to resort to such mechanisms.  As a result  we expect South-East Asia to remain a net contributor to international peace and security  as well as to economic development and prosperity. Beyond its own subregion  anchored in a strong ASEAN Community  we are indeed set to attain those achievements by 2015. ASEAN continues to be the driving force in promoting a regional architecture throughout Asia-Pacific that is conducive to the maintenance of regional peace and stability  which is precisely the kind of conditions that have enabled countries in the region to pursue a development path uninterrupted by wars and conflicts.  In the current regional setting  in Indonesia we describe that as conditions that are marked by a dynamic equilibrium  where dominant power is absent owing to a lack of the promotion of block politics and often self-fulfilling geopolitical fault lines. Rather  there exists a new kind of international relations  with its emphasis on common security  common prosperity and common stability.  This November  a revamped East Asia Summit will convene in Bali  Indonesia  with the participation of the Russian Federation and the United States for the first time. That will be part of an important regional architecture.  As ASEAN builds its Community and continues its central role in maintaining a stable and peaceful environment in the Asia-Pacific region  it sets a new challenge and a new vision for itself  that is  to develop greater cohesion and a common platform on global issues - an ASEAN that is a net contributor to the solution of many of the world’s ills and challenges. That is in keeping with ASEAN’s theme for 2011  “ASEAN Community in a Global Community of Nations”.  To conclude  I wish to assure Members of the United Nations that Indonesia will be relentless and unceasing in promoting the ideals embodied in the Charter of the United Nations in promoting peace."
"78",3220,"IND",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish to assure him of India’s full cooperation in the conduct of the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.  It is also my great pleasure to welcome in our midst the new State of South Sudan.  We meet during this session of the General Assembly at a time of great uncertainty and profound change. Until a few years ago  the world had taken for granted the benefits of globalization and global interdependence. Today we are being called upon to cope with the negative dimensions of those very phenomena. Economic  social and political events in different parts of the world have coalesced  and their adverse impact is now being felt across countries and continents.  The world economy is in trouble. The shoots of recovery which were visible after the economic and financial crisis of 2008 have yet to blossom. In many respects  the crisis has deepened even further.  The traditional engines of the global economy  including the United States  Europe and Japan  which are also the sources of global economic and financial stability  are today faced with continued economic slowdown. Recessionary trends in those countries are affecting confidence in world financial and capital markets. These developments are bound to have a negative impact on developing countries  which also have to bear the additional burden of inflationary pressures.  There has been unprecedented social and political upheaval in West Asia  the Gulf and North Africa. The peoples of those regions are demanding the right to shape their own future. Energy and food prices are once again spiralling and introducing fresh instability  especially for developing countries.  The Palestinian question remains unresolved and a source of great instability and violence. India is steadfast in its support for the Palestinian people’s struggle for a sovereign  independent  viable and united State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  living within secure and recognizable borders side by side and at peace with Israel. We look forward to welcoming Palestine as an equal Member of the United Nations.  Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head and take a grievous toll of innocent lives. New threats to international security have emerged. At a time when the world needs more international commerce  the sea lanes of communication across the Indian Ocean are under siege. Acts of piracy are being carried out with impunity from lands that are beyond the writ of any functioning State or international accountability.  Iniquitous growth  inadequate job and education opportunities and the denial of basic human freedoms are leading to a growing radicalization of the youth  intolerance and extremism.    11-51360 10   We have no choice but to meet these challenges head-on. We will succeed if we adopt a cooperative rather than a confrontational approach. We will succeed if we embrace once again the principles on which the United Nations was founded: internationalism and multilateralism. More importantly  we will succeed if our efforts have legitimacy and are pursued not just within the framework of the law but also in the spirit of the law.  The observance of the rule of law is as important in international affairs as it is within countries. Societies cannot be reordered from outside through military force. People in all countries have the right to choose their own destiny and decide their own future.  The international community has a role to play in assisting in the processes of transition and institution-building  but the idea that prescriptions should be imposed from outside is fraught with danger.  Action taken under the authority of the United Nations must respect the unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of individual States. Correspondingly  governments are duty-bound to their citizens to create conditions that enable them to freely determine their pathways to development. This is the essence of democracy and fundamental human freedoms.  There are many other things that we can do. We must address the issue of the deficit in global governance. We need a stronger and more effective United Nations. We need a United Nations that is sensitive to the aspirations of everyone  rich or poor  big or small. For this  the United Nations and its principal organs  the General Assembly and the Security Council  must be revitalized and reformed.  The reform and expansion of the Security Council are essential if it is to reflect contemporary reality. Such an outcome will enhance the Council’s credibility and effectiveness in dealing with global issues. Early reform of the Security Council must be pursued with renewed vigour and urgently enacted.  We should not allow the global economic slowdown to become a pretext for building walls around ourselves through protectionism or erecting barriers to the movement of people  services and capital. Effective ways and means must be deployed to promote the coordination of the macroeconomic policies of the major economies. The reform of the governance systems of international financial institutions should be pursued with speed and efficiency.  The development agenda must be brought firmly back to centre stage in United Nations priorities. We need a much more determined effort to ensure balanced  inclusive and sustainable development for the benefit of vast sections of humanity. Each of us can contribute to this task  but we can achieve far more if we act in partnership.  In the past few decades  India has lifted tens of millions of its people out of abject poverty. We are in a position to feed our population better  educate them better and widen their economic choices. However  we still have a very long way to go.  We wish to accelerate the pace of India’s transformation in partnership with the international community. A fast-growing India can expand the boundaries of the global economy. A democratic  plural and secular India can contribute to tolerance and peaceful coexistence among nations.  Developing countries need investment  technology and market access for their products. They need assistance in the areas of education  health  women’s empowerment and agriculture. During the recently held fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries Conference in Istanbul in May 2011  India strengthened its partnership with the least developed countries through significantly enhanced lines of credit and assistance in capacity-building.  We should pay particular attention to Africa. Africa’s richest resources are not its minerals but its people. We must empower them and open the doors for them to human advances through technology  education and skills development.  At the second India-Africa Forum Summit in Addis Ababa earlier this year  India offered lines of credit worth $5 billion and an additional $700 million in grant assistance for human resource development  technology transfer and building new institutions.  The United Nations should lead efforts in the area of food security. We need more cooperation in agricultural technologies  water conservation  land usage and productivity  and stability in commodity prices.   11 11-51360   Developing countries need a peaceful external environment in which to grow. The fight against terrorism must be unrelenting. There cannot be selective approaches in dealing with terrorist groups or the infrastructure of terrorism. Terrorism has to be fought across all fronts. In South Asia there are encouraging signs of cooperation in the area of security  as exemplified in India’s cooperation with Bangladesh. Such cooperation is adding to the security of both our countries.  However  the recent assassination of Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul is a chilling reminder of the designs of the enemies of peace in Afghanistan. It is essential that the process of nation-building and reconciliation in that country succeed. This is vital for ensuring peace and security in the region. India will play its part in helping the people of Afghanistan build a better future for themselves  just as we are doing in other countries in South Asia. We will do so because prosperity and stability in our region are indivisible.  We wish to see an open  inclusive and transparent architecture of regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and peaceful settlement of disputes. I call upon the United Nations to evolve a comprehensive and effective response to the problem of piracy in the Red Sea and off the coast of Somalia. As a littoral State of the Indian Ocean  India is ready to work with other countries in that regard. Simultaneously  the international community should continue with efforts to restore stability in Somalia. We have joined international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the countries afflicted with severe famine and drought in the Horn of Africa  specifically Somalia  Kenya and Djibouti.  Nuclear proliferation continues to be a threat to international security. The action plan put forward by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world provides  even today  a concrete road map for achieving nuclear disarmament in a time-bound  universal  non-discriminatory  phased and verifiable manner. I commend the United Nations for its efforts in focusing world attention on nuclear safety. Our plans for utilizing nuclear power to meet our energy needs hinge on full satisfaction of our concerns about the safety of nuclear energy. We have undertaken a thorough review of the safety of our nuclear plants.  The perspectives I have outlined to the Assembly are those that have guided our actions in the Security Council since India became a non-permanent member of the Council in January. There are still millions of people living in poverty across the world. Their plight has worsened  through no fault of theirs  due to the global economic and financial crisis of recent years. The actions of Governments around the world are therefore under close scrutiny. It is vitally important that through our actions and deeds we renew the people’s faith in the Charter and objectives of the United Nations. I am confident that we can do this through acts of statesmanship  foresight and collective effort. India stands ready to play its part in this noble endeavour."
"79",3266,"IRL",66,2011,"We are living in times of breathtaking change. Much of it is good change: scientific and technological progress making real advances for humankind  an ever more interconnected world strengthening economic opportunity and developmental potential  the profound transformations that are sweeping through North Africa at present.  But there is also much that is disturbing: violent conflict in many parts of the world  growing environmental damage to our planet  the ravages of a global financial and economic crisis  the continuing scourges of poverty  inequality  human rights abuses  terrorism and extremism and a range of other threats to global peace and security.   To respond to these multiple and interrelated challenges  we have one constant anchor: the United Nations. No other organization is as well equipped to develop common answers to the big questions of our time. No other organization has the same global impact and legitimacy. With our increasing need for global solutions  the United Nations  which represents almost all the countries on earth  has the political  moral and legal authority to act. While there may be no easy answers to the questions being posed  our best chance of finding effective responses lies in the collective deliberation and action provided for by this Organization.  Ireland is deeply committed to the United Nations. We look to it to uphold and defend the universal values of peace  security  human rights and development that are set out in the United Nations Charter. The Charter tells us that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. The United Nations is the embodiment of freedom and equality. It is a bulwark defending these core human values in a changing and uncertain world.   Freedom and equality: these are the values that underpin Ireland’s response to key global and regional challenges. It is our deep commitment to freedom and equality that places Ireland in the vanguard of international efforts to resolve conflict  to create and maintain peace  to eradicate hunger and underdevelopment  and to put an end to human rights abuses around the world.  The values of freedom and equality and the essential ideals of the Charter are not just words written on a page. Since we assembled here 12 months ago  we have seen them expressed in North Africa and the Middle East in a million acts of courage and liberation. We have watched the people of the Arab Spring  who have asserted their rights and stood up to oppression and corruption. Tahrir — freedom — has now passed into all our vocabularies as a byword for all those no longer prepared to see their basic human rights suppressed.   The events of the past nine months in North Africa and the Middle East are historic in their sweep and profound in their implications. These have been genuinely popular movements demanding reform    25 11-51384  freedom and equality. The leadership role exercised within them by women has been striking and inspirational.  The people of the Arab Spring have stood up and stood together to assert their basic rights and freedoms: the right to choose their own leaders  the right not to live in fear of the knock on the door  the right to live freely and openly  the right to provide a decent life and a hopeful future for themselves and their families. They remind us that the human thirst for basic freedoms is unquenchable  and they should inspire us in the work we do here. In rising up to grasp their own destiny  the peoples of Tunisia  Egypt and Libya are tracing the path of those others  once in the shadow of the Iron Curtain  who  in demanding those ordinary freedoms  created extraordinary history.  The United Nations has  of course  played an indispensable role in supporting these developments. Starting with the key Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011)  it has led international efforts to support the Libyan people. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the National Transitional Council who took up Libya’s seat at the United Nations this week  and I pledge Ireland’s full support as they seek to rebuild Libya and to fulfil the democratic aspirations of the Libyan people.   We cannot know the final outcome of the events we are witnessing. We must ensure that the democratic changes under way are consolidated and that the promise of profound improvements in human rights in the countries concerned  in particular in relation to the role of women  is fully realized.  However  the situation in Syria continues to arouse the deepest international concern. President Al-Assad and his Government seem oblivious to the demands of the Syrian people for change and to the lessons of the Arab Spring elsewhere. They appear determined to respond with further oppression and violence. Our basic message to the Syrian leader is this: no leader who refuses to listen to what his people are saying and to act on their clearly expressed desire for peace and reform can expect to remain in power.  In the Middle East peace process  the search for freedom and equality has yet to bear fruit. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains depressingly deadlocked. Unless this deadlock is broken  the opportunities for yet another generation of children will be destroyed.   The situation in the Middle East is urgent. After 20 years of failed initiatives  disillusionment about the ability of the political process to deliver a settlement is deepening. Young Palestinians in particular are frustrated and despairing. The position of the moderate Palestinian leadership is under threat. Never has it been more important to show that politics works and that a peaceful  just and lasting settlement is within reach through negotiation.  Everybody knows what a final and comprehensive settlement would involve: two States  based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps  living side by side in peace and security. It is more pressing than ever to launch direct negotiations that would address all the core issues and culminate in such an agreement within a specified time frame.   Ireland has long been an advocate of the establishment of a sovereign  independent Palestinian State within borders based on those of 1967. We want to see the peoples of Palestine and Israel living as good neighbours in peace  security and prosperity as soon as possible — and this can come about only through negotiation. Ireland strongly opposes all action that serves to hinder or delay negotiations  such as violent attacks on civilians and their property or Israel’s illegal settlement of occupied Palestinian territory.   The decision of President Abbas to seek membership in the United Nations for Palestine is entirely legitimate and understandable. Palestine has the same right to membership in the United Nations as Ireland or any other Member of this Organization. Some would seek to argue that Palestine cannot be recognized as a State because its borders remain to be agreed on. But if the borders of Palestine are still a matter for negotiation  then so  by definition  are those of Israel  which is rightly a full Member of the United Nations.  Membership in the United Nations of itself  however  would not change the unstable and unacceptable situation on the ground. It does not remove the compelling need for negotiations. Nor will it offer a legitimate excuse to avoid negotiations. Whatever happens here at the United Nations  negotiations must resume as soon as possible. The statement issued last Friday by the Quartet provides a framework for precisely that.  What recognition of Palestinian statehood would do  however  is to give dignity and support to the    11-51384 26  Palestinian people  who have suffered for too long. It would also be a tangible demonstration of the commitment of the international community and the United Nations to an agreed settlement between two sovereign States  living side by side in peace  security and prosperity.  The day will come  not too far off  when the General Assembly will be asked to vote on a proposal to admit Palestine as a Member of the Organization  or perhaps  as an interim step towards the achievement of that goal  to accord Palestine non-member observer State status. Provided that the resolution is drafted in terms that are reasonable and balanced  I expect Ireland to give its full support. In Ireland  we know from our own experience that peace does not come easily. It requires political will and difficult compromises. But we also know the benefits of peace. There can be no doubting the hugely transformative power for the Middle East region of a final end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The international community has invested far too much effort and resources over the past decades not to do all it can now to assist a return to direct talks by the two sides. In the words of Martin Luther King  we cannot ignore the fierce urgency of now.  I again urge the Government of Israel to halt all settlement expansion. I also call on it to end the unjust blockade of Gaza by opening up land crossings to normal commercial  human and humanitarian traffic.  The search for freedom and equality drives the enormously important work being done by the United Nations and by its individual Member States in the area of development.  The Millennium Development Goals provide the essential framework for international development efforts up to 2015. As we look beyond 2015  the United Nations must remain central to the fight to end poverty and hunger in the world.  A century and a half ago  the streets around this building where we now meet  and throughout this great city  were thronged with tens of thousands of Irish people who came here as refugees from famine. To this very day  the memory of that time remains with the Irish people.  Hunger remains humankind’s greatest enemy. As we meet today in New York  some 12 million people are struggling to find food to keep their families alive in the Horn of Africa. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand are at imminent risk of death from hunger. The immediate cause of this crisis is drought  but its severity is the result of a combination of factors  including conflict  insecurity and persistent underdevelopment. We have a moral obligation to act in the face of such suffering.   Ireland is providing over $67 million to the Horn of Africa in 2011 and 2012  in direct life saving humanitarian assistance and through measures to enhance food security. The clear lesson of previous humanitarian emergencies in Africa is that we must address the causes in order to prevent future crises. The need to address the systemic global hunger crisis is  and will remain  central to Ireland’s development assistance programme. Our objective is to save lives today and build new futures for communities ravaged by hunger. The Scaling Up Nutrition movement  launched at the United Nations a year ago  makes a clear link between under-nutrition among mothers and babies and the building of a healthy  educated and prosperous society in the future.  We need to act together now to provide long-term sustainable solutions that will decisively break the cycle of food shortages. We believe that a strong focus is essential on building the productivity of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa  80 per cent of whom are women and the primary care givers of children and providers of food  fuel and water.  We know that climate change is disproportionately affecting their lives and their livelihoods. Their farms and livestock are less productive. Their coping mechanisms are less effective. Over time  they are vulnerable to abject poverty and despair. I believe that there is a compelling case for “climate justice”  namely  bringing developmental fairness to bear on the climate change agenda.  The global financial and economic crisis presents major challenges for all of us in our efforts to maintain solidarity with developing countries. Aid budgets are under significant pressure. But we will not turn our backs on the world’s poorest. In Ireland  despite the economic difficulties that we are facing  and because we recognize our moral obligation and our interests  values and principles as a member of the international community  development will remain at the heart of our foreign policy. We remain committed to the United   27 11-51384  Nations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross national income to Official Development Assistance (ODA). We will continue to work to achieve that target.  As Ireland will sustain its ODA effort  we will also maintain our longstanding engagement across critical areas of United Nations work. We remain strongly supportive of the vital role of the United Nations in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. Recently a 440-strong battalion of peacekeepers from the Irish Defence Forces returned to serve with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  the first country to which we deployed peacekeepers more than half a century ago.  A deep attachment to the values of freedom and equality and other core human rights principles underpins our candidature for election to the Human Rights Council at the elections to be held in 2012. If elected  we look forward to making a strong contribution to the work of enhancing the Council’s performance and promoting respect for human rights worldwide.  We will continue to push for the disarmament machinery of the United Nations to become more responsive to twenty-first century imperatives. Key challenges for the year ahead include the implementation of the agreements reached at last year’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  as well as the negotiation of a robust arms trade treaty. We will maintain a strong focus on the implementation and universalization of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  adopted in Dublin three years ago.  Regional organizations have always been vital partners for the United Nations in the areas of peace  security and conflict resolution. Next year  Ireland will chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We look forward to making our contribution to the resolution of the so-called protracted conflicts within the OSCE region. Our chairmanship will be a practical demonstration of Ireland’s strong commitment to multilateralism and will draw on our own national experience of conflict resolution.  Over the past week  the Assembly has heard of a formidable array of challenges facing the world. Peace and security  human rights  the elimination of hunger: these are among the great moral imperatives of our time. Underlying each of them is the need to assert the freedom and equality of all human beings. Now more than ever  the United Nations is demonstrating that it is the home for these fundamental values and goals and the arena in which we can best pursue collective solutions.  Ireland will play its full part in the search for those solutions. Whether it is to bring peace to parts of the world ravaged by conflict  relief to those threatened by famine and starvation or protection to those afflicted by human rights abuses  we will make our contribution. We will stand up  in the Assembly and elsewhere  for fairness  for justice  for freedom and for equality  in the conduct of international relations."
"80",3313,"IRN",66,2011,"I am grateful to the Almighty Allah  who has granted me once more an opportunity to appear before the General Assembly. I have the pleasure to express my sincere thanks to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  for his tremendous efforts during his tenure. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as the President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  Let me seize this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who lost their lives in the past year as a result of natural disasters  in particular the victims of the tragic famine in Somalia and the devastating flood in Pakistan. I urge everyone to intensify their assistance to the affected populations in those countries.   Over the past years  I have spoken about different global issues and the need to introduce fundamental changes in the current international order. Today  considering international developments  I will try to analyze the present situation from a different angle.  As everyone knows  the superiority of human beings and their dominance over other creatures lie in the very nature and the truth of humankind  which is a divine gift and a manifestation of the divine spirit embodying faith in God  the everlasting Creator and Planner of the entire universe who shows compassion  generosity  justice and integrity in both words and deeds; the quest for dignity to reach the pinnacles of perfection  the aspirations to elevate one’s material and spiritual status and the longing to realize liberty; defying oppression  corruption and discrimination and trying to support the oppressed; seeking happiness and lasting prosperity and security for all.   Those are some of the manifestations of common divine and human attributes that can clearly be seen in the historical aspirations of human beings to create a heritage of art and literature  both in prose and poetry  and in the socio-cultural and political movements of human beings throughout the course of history. All divine prophets and social reformers have invited human beings to tread on this righteous path. God gave dignity to humankind in order to elevate its status so that it can assume the role of His successor on Earth.  It is vividly clear that  despite all historical achievements  including the creation of the United Nations  which was the product of untiring struggles and the efforts of free-minded and justice-seeking individuals and of international cooperation  human societies remain far from fulfilling their noble desires and aspirations. Most nations of the world are unhappy with the current international circumstances. Despite the general longing and aspiration for peace  progress and fraternity  wars  mass murder  widespread poverty and socio-economic and political crises continue to infringe upon the rights and sovereignty of nations  leaving behind irreparable damage to all nations worldwide.     11-50865 16   Approximately  3 billion of the world’s people live on less than $2.50 a day  and over 200 million people live without even having one proper meal per day. Forty per cent of the world’s poorest populations only share 5 per cent of global income  while 20 per cent of the richest people share 75 per cent of economic earnings worldwide. More than 20 000 innocent and destitute children around the world die every day because of poverty. Eighty per cent of financial resources in the United States of America are controlled by 10 per cent of its people  while only 20 per cent of those resources belong to 90 per cent of the population.  What are the causes and reasons behind these inequalities? How can one remedy such injustice? Those who dominate and run the centres of global economic power put the blame on peoples’ religious aspirations and the pursuit of the path of divine prophets  or on the weakness of nations and the poor performance of a number of groups or individuals. They claim that only their views  approaches and prescriptions can save humankind and the world economy. I ask everyone here whether they think that the root cause of the problems can be solved in the prevailing international order of the way the world is governed.  I want to draw attention to the following questions. Who abducted by force tens of millions of people from their homes in Africa and other regions of the world during the dark period of slavery  making Africans the victims of the materialistic greed of the United States and Europe? Who imposed colonialism on the world for over four centuries? Who occupied lands and massively plundered other nations’ resources  destroyed talents and obliterated native languages  cultures and national identities? Who triggered the First and Second World Wars  which left 70 million dead and hundreds of millions injured or homeless? Who created the wars in the Korean peninsula and Viet Nam?   Who imposed  through deceit and hypocrisy  the Zionist agenda and almost 60 years of war  homelessness  terror and mass murder on the Palestinian people and the countries of the region? Who imposed and supported for decades military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes on Asian  African and Latin American nations  and established friendly relations with all of them? Who used atomic bombs against defenceless people and then stockpiled thousands of warheads in their arsenals? Whose economies rely on waging wars and selling arms?   Who provoked and encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade and impose an eight-year war on Iran  and who assisted and equipped him to deploy chemical weapons against our cities and our people? Who used the mysterious 11 September incident as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq  killing  injuring and displacing millions in those two countries  with the ultimate goal of bringing the Middle East and its oil resources under its domination?   Who undermined the Bretton Woods system and printed trillions of dollars without the backing of gold reserves or an equivalent currency  a move that triggered inflation worldwide and was intended to prey on the economic gains of other nations? What country’s annual military spending exceeds $1 trillion annually — more than the military budgets of all countries of the world combined? Which Governments are the ones most indebted in the world  and which Government threatens all nations and countries on any pretext?   Who dominates the policymaking establishments of the world economy? Who are the ones who are responsible for the world economic recession and are imposing its consequences in the United States and Europe on Asian  African  Latin American and all other nations? Which Governments are ever ready to drop thousands of bombs on other countries but ponder and hesitate to send a bit of food aid to famine-stricken people in Somalia or elsewhere? Who are the ones dominating the Security Council  which is ostensibly responsible for safeguarding international security?   There exist dozens of other similar questions  and of course the answers are clear. The majority of nations and Governments of the world have had no role in the creation of the current global crisis  and in fact are themselves the victims of such policies. It is as clear as daylight that the same slave-masters and colonial Powers that once triggered the two World Wars have caused widespread misery and disorder  with far-reaching effects across the globe since then. They continue to control the international political centres and the Security Council.   Do those arrogant Powers really have the competence and ability to run or govern the world? Is it acceptable that they call themselves the sole defenders of freedom  democracy and human rights    17 11-50865  while they attack and occupy other countries militarily? Can the flower of democracy blossom from NATO’s missiles  bombs and guns?   If some European countries still use the Holocaust — after six decades — as an excuse to pay ransom to the Zionists  should it not be an obligation of the slave masters and colonial Powers to pay reparations to the affected nations? If the damage and losses of the period of slavery and colonialism were indeed compensated for  what would happen to the manipulators and behind-the-scenes political powers in the United States and Europe? Would the gaps between the North and the South remain? If only half of the military expenditures of the United States and its allies in NATO were cut to help solve the economic problems in their own countries  would they be experiencing any symptoms of the economic crisis? What would happen if the same amount were allocated to poor nations?   What is the justification for the presence of hundreds of United States military and intelligence bases in various parts of the world  including 268 bases in Germany  124 in Japan  87 in the Republic of Korea  83 in Italy  45 in the United Kingdom  21 in Portugal and hundreds of other bases in other parts of the world? Is that anything other than military occupation? Do not the bombs deployed in the United States bases undermine the security of other nations?  The main question is the root causes of such attitudes. The prime reason should be sought in the beliefs and tendencies of the establishment  which is made up of people in conflict with their inner human instincts and disposition  who also have no faith in God and in the path of the divine prophets to replace their lust for power and materialistic ends with heavenly values. To them  only power and wealth prevail. Every attempt must be made to bring into focus those sinister goals.   Oppressed nations have no hope to safeguard or protect their legitimate rights against those Powers. Those Powers seek their progress  prosperity and dignity through the poverty  humiliation and annihilation of others. They consider themselves superior to others  enjoying special privileges or concessions. They have no respect for others and casually violate the rights of all nations and Governments. They proclaim themselves the indisputable custodians of all Governments and nations through intimidation  recourse to threats and force  and the abuse of international mechanisms.   They insist on imposing their lifestyle and beliefs on others. They officially support racism. They weaken countries through military intervention and destroy their infrastructure in order to plunder their resources by making them all the more dependent. They sow the seeds of hate and hostility among nations and people of different pursuits in order to prevent them from fulfilling their goals of development and progress.  All cultural identities  lives and values  as well as the wealth of nations and human values  including of women  children and youth  are sacrificed to their hegemonistic tendencies and their inclination to enslave and capture other nations.  Hypocrisy and deceit are allowed in order to secure their interests and imperialistic intentions. Drug trafficking and the killing of innocent human beings are also allowed in pursuit of such diabolical goals. Despite NATO’s presence in occupied Afghanistan  there has been a dramatic increase in the production of illicit drugs in that country.  They tolerate no question or criticism and  instead of presenting a reason for their violations  they always put themselves in the position of a claimant.  By using their imperialistic media network  which is under the influence of colonialism  they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the event of 11 September with sanctions and military action.  Last year  when the need to form a fact-finding team to undertake a thorough investigation concerning the hidden elements involved in the 11 September incident was brought up — an idea also endorsed by all independent Governments and nations  as well as by the majority of people in the United States — my country and I were pressured and threatened by the Government of the United States. Instead of assigning a fact-finding team  they killed the main perpetrator and threw his body into the sea.  Would it not have been reasonable to bring to justice and openly try the main perpetrator of the incident in order to identify the elements and reasons behind the safe space provided for the invading aircraft to attack the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center? Why should it not have been allowed to bring him to trial so as to help efforts to recognize those who    11-50865 18  launched terrorist groups and brought wars and other miseries into the region? Is there any classified information that must be kept secret?  They view Zionism as a sacred notion or ideology. Any question concerning its foundation and history is condemned by them as an unforgivable sin. However  they endorse and allow sacrileges and insults against the beliefs of other divine religions.  Real freedom  justice  dignity and well-being and lasting security are the rights of all nations. Those values can be achieved neither by reliance on the current inefficient system of world governance nor through the intervention of the world’s arrogant Powers or the gun barrels of NATO forces. Those values can be realized only through independence  the recognition of others’ rights  harmony and cooperation.  Is there any way to address the problems and challenges besetting the world by using the prevailing international mechanisms and tools so as to help humankind achieve its long-standing aspirations of peace  security and equality?  All those who tried to introduce reforms while preserving the existing norms and tendencies have failed. The valuable efforts made by the Non-Aligned Movement  the Group of 77 and the Group of 15  as well as by some prominent individuals  have failed to bring about fundamental changes  although they did have their respective impacts and effects.  The governance and management of the world require fundamental reforms  but what has to be done now? Efforts must be made  with firm resolve and through collective cooperation  to map out a new plan on the basis of principles and the very foundation of such universal human values as monotheism  justice  freedom  love and the quest for happiness  on the basis of happiness for all.  The idea of creating the United Nations remains a great and historic achievement of humankind. Its importance must be appreciated and its capacities must be used for our noble goals  to the extent possible. We should not allow the Organization  which reflects the collective will and shared aspirations of the community of nations  to deviate from its main course and play into the hands of the world Powers.  The necessary groundwork must be laid to ensure collective participation and the involvement of nations in efforts to promote lasting peace and security. The shared and collective management of the world must be achieved in its true sense and be based on the underlying principles enshrined in international law. Justice must serve as the criterion and the basis for all international decisions and actions.   All of us should acknowledge the fact that there is no way other than the shared and collective management of the world to put an end to today’s worldwide disorder  tyranny and discrimination. This is indeed the only way to ensure the prosperity and welfare of human society  which is an established and vivid truth. While acknowledging that truth  one should note that acknowledgement alone is not enough. We must believe in it and spare no effort towards its realization.  The shared and collective management of the world is the legitimate right of all nations. As their representatives  we have an obligation to defend their rights. Although some Powers continuously try to frustrate all international efforts aimed at promoting collective cooperation  we must nevertheless strengthen our belief in achieving the desired goal of establishing shared and collective cooperation to run the world.  The United Nations was created to enable the effective participation of all nations in international decision-making processes. We all know that this goal has not yet been fulfilled  owing to the absence of justice in the current management structures and mechanisms of the United Nations.   The composition of the Security Council is unjust and inequitable. Therefore  changes that include the restructuring of the United Nations are considered as the basic demands of nations and must be addressed by the General Assembly.  During last year’s session  I emphasized the importance of this issue and called for the designation of the present decade as the decade of shared and collective global management  and for all capacities and resources to be mobilized in that direction. I would now like to reiterate my proposal. I am sure that  through international cooperation  the efforts of committed world leaders and Governments  an insistence on justice and the support of all other nations  we can expedite the process of building a bright common future. This movement is certainly on the rightful path to its creation  and carries with it the assurance of a promising future for humankind. That   19 11-50865  future will be built when humankind sets off on the path of the divine prophets and the righteous  under the leadership of Imam Al-Mahdi  the ultimate saviour of humankind and the heir to all divine messengers and leaders and to the pure generation of our great prophet.  The creation of a supreme and ideal society with the arrival of a perfect human being who is a true and sincere lover of all humankind is the guaranteed promise of Allah. He will come with Jesus Christ to lead those who love freedom and justice to eradicate tyranny and discrimination and promote knowledge  peace  justice  freedom and love across the world. He will present to every single individual all the beauty of the world and all good things that bring happiness  the promise of a better tomorrow and the sweet taste of life to all humankind.   Today nations have been awakened and  with the increase in public awareness  they no longer submit to oppression and discrimination. The world today is witnessing more than ever a widespread awakening in Islamic lands  in Asia  in Europe and in America. Every day  those movements are expanding their scope and influence to pursue the realization of justice  freedom and the creation of a better tomorrow.  Our great nation  with its millennial civilization and history  stands ready to join hands with other nations to march along that beautiful path  in harmony and in line with the shared aspirations of humankind. Let us salute love and freedom  let us salute justice and knowledge and let us salute the bright future that awaits humankind."
"81",3360,"IRQ",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  and our brothers  the people of Qatar  on your election to the presidency of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our delegation will be of assistance to you in the performance of your duties  and we are confident that your experience and wisdom will be an important factor in the success of the Assembly’s work. Our thanks also go to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his presidency of the General Assembly at its outgoing session. I should also like to warmly congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his appointment to a second term and wish him every success in his work.  It is an honour to stand in front of the Assembly one more time to brief members on the most notable developments that Iraq is witnessing as it works on building a modern State that lives in peace and security with its people and its neighbours. Iraq is building a homeland where everyone lives in peace and stability regardless of sectarian  ethnic or factional affiliations; a system where the rule of law prevails and human rights are respected; and a system that is based on democracy and the peaceful alternation of power. That is the basis for the path on which we have embarked and are continually implementing.   The events currently taking place in the Arab region have proved the rightness of the path that we have been following. The values of change and reform  which Iraq has called and will continue to call for  have become an essential part of the aspirations of the Arab people for freedom and for their ability to choose their own political system on the basis of democracy and human rights.   We have come a long way in building our political system  which is based on the National Collaboration Government. Iraq has started to restore the elements of strength that were lost due to more than three decades of internal and external wars conducted by the former dictatorship  due also to the international isolation and the sanctions that Iraq experienced and to the collapse of security institutions and outbreak of sectarian strife that threatened its national existence after the collapse of the former regime. We began to overcome these negative elements and they became history  thanks to our determination and steadfastness and with the help and support of the international community.  With regard to development  having witnessed the big improvement in security in Iraq  we are still relying on the five-year plan for the years 2010-2014 announced by the Iraqi Government on 4 April 2010 and on the licensing rounds held between Iraq and major companies on oil and natural gas investments to improve our oil industry. That was done to turn the wheels of development and push the economy to advanced levels.   It is expected that the five-year plan that has already started will include about 2 700 strategic projects in different sectors  with a cost of $186 billion. The plan would provide about four million job opportunities  which will positively deal with the unemployment problem in Iraq. It is hoped that by the end of this plan  the per capita income of Iraqi citizens will have increased to $8 000 annually and poverty levels will have decreased by 16 per cent.  In addition  we were able to get rid of the sanctions and restrictions imposed on Iraq as a result of the invasion of Kuwait. On the basis of Security Council resolutions 1956 (2010)  1957 (2010) and 1958 (2010)  adopted on 15 December 2010  Iraq has been freed completely from all the restrictions imposed on it  which had prevented the country from taking advantage of scientific and technological advances  and has gained sovereignty over its financial resources.   After that important stage in building our State  we feel that we are taking firm steps on the road to democracy and development and that we are opening   5 11-51185  the doors to investment in Iraq. Therefore  the economic policy of Iraq is essentially based on encouraging investment and providing the appropriate legislative environment to protect investors and their capital so that Iraq can become a safe and fertile investing environment in many essential sectors  such as oil  natural gas  electricity  reconstruction  infrastructure and other economic sectors. From this rostrum I call on all countries to open collaboration channels with Iraq in the field of investment and to take advantage of the available opportunities.   Iraqi Kurdistan has witnessed important developments in the fields of construction  the economy  the culture and others. Thousands of villages that were destroyed by the former regime have been rebuilt. Cities  towns and roadways have been modernized. The region now has more than 15 public and private universities with more than 100 000 students  compared to the past when there was only one university with a few thousand students.  At the end of this year the United States forces will withdraw  according to the agreement signed between the two countries in 2008. During this year  our security forces have shown a great ability to combat terrorism and provide security. These forces are capable and will efficiently fill the vacuum that the withdrawal of the United States forces will create. That will promote Iraqi national abilities to maintain the gains achieved in the new Iraq.   However  the need will push the Government of Iraq to keep numbers of American experts and others in order to benefit from their experience in the fields of training and capacity-building  according to Iraq’s needs. On this occasion  on behalf of the Government and people of Iraq  I should like to express our thanks and appreciation to the United States  other friendly States and the United Nations that provided assistance and support to the Iraqi people and Government in order to enhance democracy and reconstruction.   I avail myself of the opportunity of being here in New York to express to the people of New York and to all Americans feelings of sympathy and solidarity on the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on 11 September.  Regarding Iraq’s international and regional relations  the Constitution of Iraq and the national programme of the current Iraqi Government determine the general foundations for our foreign policy. They provide that Iraq is a founding and effective member of the League of Arab States and is committed to its Charter. Iraq is also a member of the Islamic world. On this basis Iraq is working to host the Arab summit at the end of March 2012.   Moreover  Iraq respects the principles of good neighbourliness and is committed to non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. It seeks to solve disputes by peaceful means  establishes its relations on the basis of common interests and reciprocity  and respects its international obligations. That is why we invite our two neighbours  Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran  to resort to diplomacy and positive dialogue in order to solve the issues and to stop bombing Iraqi territories in the Kurdistan region  which is causing many innocent civilian victims. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank His Holiness Khamenei of the Islamic Republic of Iran for releasing the two American prisoners in Iran.  With regard to our obligations to disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation  the Constitution of Iraq was clear in determining the position of Iraq concerning this issue. Article 9 E of the Iraqi Constitution provides that  “The Iraqi Government shall respect and implement Iraq’s international obligations regarding the non-proliferation  non-development  non-production  and non-use of nuclear  chemical  and biological weapons  and shall prohibit associated equipment  materiel  technologies  and delivery systems for use in the development  manufacture  production  and use of such weapons.” On this clear position and commitment of Iraq to international instruments concerning disarmament  the Security Council on 15 December 2010 adopted resolution 1957 (2010)  which lifted all restrictions that were imposed on Iraq.   In this context we wish to confirm the legitimate right of States to the peaceful use of nuclear power and its technologies according to the rules and provisions of the relevant international conventions. This right constitutes one of the foundations of the disarmament system and non-proliferation. Within this approach and with regard to the nuclear issue concerning the Islamic Republic of Iran  we believe in the legitimate right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That right is guaranteed by international instruments  at    11-51185 6  the forefront of which is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.   We affirm the importance of reaching a peaceful solution in dealing with this issue. Dialogue and calm diplomacy are the best means to achieve that goal. On the other hand  any escalation will prejudice the interests of all parties and will put the security of the region at great risk.  Iraq is concerned about the tragic situation of the brotherly Palestinian people as a result of Israeli practices  which are incompatible with international laws  customs and international humanitarian law. Iraq is doing everything in its power to support the struggle of the Palestinian people to obtain all their inalienable rights  in particular the right to establish an independent State in its homeland  with its capital in Jerusalem.   In this regard  Iraq endorses and supports the path embarked on by the Palestinian Authority to come to the United Nations to achieve full international recognition of a Palestinian State during the current session of the General Assembly. Iraq calls on the international community and all peace-loving forces to stand by the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle to achieve their goals and demands that the Israeli Government fully withdraw from all Arab territories occupied in 1967. That would essentially contribute to the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and bring a comprehensive and just peace to this vital region of the world.   Making the Middle East an area free of weapons of mass destruction is crucial to achieve peace  security and stability. That requires Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to put its nuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The countries of the Arab world are witnessing significant developments and unprecedented reforms and political changes  the effects of which will be reflected in the future of the whole region and will extend to areas beyond. Iraq  as an early actor in initiating this change  supports the struggle of the Arab people of the region to gain their freedom  choose their political systems and exercise their right to peaceful demonstrations and protests in the so-called Arab Spring. We hope that these changes will contribute to regional stability and security and avoid anything that might threaten the unity and sovereignty of the countries of the region or stir up strife or sectarian and ethnic conflicts.  In the area of international cooperation  Iraq will work to promote cooperation with all countries that stood with it and supported it in the stability of the ongoing political process  in strengthening it and in reconstruction. We refer here to the United States of America and to the European Union. When we mention these two parties we mention them not because they are the only ones that stood with Iraq  but because we are linked by mechanisms of action that should be implemented. There are many other friends who stood with us in the difficult times that we have experienced  and we will remember that favour and develop relations of cooperation with them.   After the withdrawal of the United States forces from Iraq by the end of this year  we will work to enhance and expand the scope of cooperation on the basis of the strategic framework agreement signed between the two countries in 2008. According to that agreement  relations will be for the long term and will cover all aspects of life.   The same is true for the European Union. After finishing the drafting of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Iraq and the European Union and its possible signing in the near future  and signing a memorandum of understanding on the strategic partnership in the field of energy between Iraq and the European Union  the cooperation between the two parties will take a broader scope in various fields covered by those agreements.   Our economic  commercial and political relations with the People’s Republic of China are expanding and improving. Our relations with neighbouring Arab countries  India and Pakistan  are also constantly improving.  Regarding our relationship with the United Nations  we will continue an approach of constructive cooperation with all United Nations bodies  in the forefront of which are the Security Council and the Secretariat  and we will keep the commitments we have made.   I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the efforts by Special Representative of the Secretary-General Mr. Ad Melkert throughout his time in Iraq. I wish him and his family success and good   7 11-51185  health. I welcome the new representative of the Secretary-General. We will continue to cooperate with him in a way that will enable him to carry out his task in accordance with Security Council resolution 1770 (2007) and subsequent resolutions.   The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq will receive all forms of support and assistance from us  in particular during the next phase  and we will do our utmost to provide the necessary protection for its staff and premises.  We look forward with confidence and optimism to the future. Iraq is an emerging democracy and a country brimming with a wealth of natural and human resources. We are working to make it an important factor in regional stability  security and prosperity and a living example of democracy  federalism and the voluntary coexistence of different ethnic and sectarian groups and communities."
"82",3407,"ISL",66,2011,"Let me start by congratulating His Excellency Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  and assuring him that he will have the fullest cooperation of the Icelandic delegation.  In recent weeks  we have witnessed the worst hunger crisis of this century in the Horn of Africa. It is a devastating reminder that fighting poverty and hunger is still the most important and challenging undertaking of our times. Our collective duty and responsibility is to help our weakest brothers and sisters. As wealthier nations  we must do better in providing relief. We must act with more speed and more generosity to help those who are deprived of the basic necessities of life — food and water. I can say  my friends  that in Iceland  we have indeed decided to do so.  I am quite happy to be able to tell the Assembly today that the Icelandic Parliament has unanimously agreed to substantially increase our contribution to developing nations in the coming financial year. It has also accepted a plan to raise our aid to the goal of 0.7 per cent of our gross national income. That is our pledge  as agreed by every political party in the Icelandic Parliament.  The fight against hunger and poverty is the same struggle as the one we wage to protect our planet from the ravages caused by the greed of our own species. All Members know that  next year  we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the bright new vision introduced at the historic Earth Summit in Rio. Over these past 20 years  deep concern for the environment has indeed moved to the forefront of the global agenda. But the Assembly also knows the sobering truth  which is that the ambitions of Rio are still a far cry from being realized. Actions are still needed. If ever there was a time to act boldly  that time is now.  The key theme of Rio next year will be the “green economy”. I assure the Assembly that my country has expertise to offer that can help to fuel a green revolution. Renewable energy  marine health  the sustainable use of land and  not least  gender equality  which have always been at the core of the Icelandic foreign policy  are the four issues that we shall bring to Rio next year. What we really need is indeed a revolution  a green revolution. We need a seismic shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That is the only way to turn the ship.  In Iceland  we have some cutting-edge technology on geothermal energy that we want to share. That splendid form of renewable energy is the most undervalued and overlooked source of cheap power in the world. Of course  geothermal is most    11-51390 4  certainly not a silver bullet  but it needs to be a part of the portfolio that we must develop to solve emissions problems. Many members know that Central and South America  East Africa and South-East Asia are home to vast areas literally brimming with geothermal potential. Icelandic know-how  coupled with outside financing  could go a long way in making those areas self-sufficient in terms of green energy.  As one of the largest fishing nations  Iceland has always been deeply protective of the health of the oceans. Today  climate change threatens to place the fisheries of the world under a new strain. As we speak  the acidification of the oceans resulting from human carbon emissions is affecting the health of the marine environment. This is especially true in the Arctic and its vicinity  which is my home. As a marine biologist  I fear that  more likely sooner than later  this may affect the world’s fishing stocks  which are a vital source of protein for more than 1 billion people. This is just one more argument why we so urgently need to conclude a post-Kyoto agreement later this year on the reduction of greenhouse gases.  Every day  the Arctic bears silent witness to the impact of climate change. The snow that I experienced as a child is today fast becoming a rare event for my two teenage daughters. The sad truth is that the Arctic glaciers and the Arctic sea ice are melting at a much faster rate than anyone ever anticipated. It is of course true that the disappearance of the sea ice will open up new and shorter transport routes from the Pacific to the North Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean. We most certainly will also see huge areas open up for the exploitation of oil and gas resources.  This will come at a price  however. Climatic changes are forcing the peoples of the Arctic  such as our neighbours in Greenland  to change their living habits. These changes will also melt the tundra  which acts as a carbon buffer against the climate system  and thus further accelerate the warming of the planet. The already-fragile ecosystem of the Arctic will become even more brittle.  Let us remember what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and let us be aware that oil breaks down very  very slowly in the extreme cold of the Arctic. We should not allow the exploitation of the Arctic without applying the strictest rules. That must be the precondition for every human move into Arctic resources.  I am often asked whether a country like Iceland  which is not geographically small but has  admittedly  slightly fewer people than most  can have any say in action on issues of global concern  be it in Rio or in New York. Well  to lift a phrase from a famous statesman who spoke from this very podium a few days ago: “Yes  we can”.   Twenty years ago  in 1991  we in Iceland watched a television broadcast of thousands of brave Latvians  Lithuanians and Estonians taking their destiny into their own hands. They reached out to the international community  among them the people of Iceland  and asked for help in breaking the ice that was impeding their international recognition.  The great British statesman  Lord Palmerston  once made a famous statement to the effect that there is no such thing as eternal friendship between nations and that only eternal interests could determine how nations reacted towards each other. That well-known mantra is still taught today in every bad school of political science. My friends  if Palmerston’s words had prevailed  Iceland would have turned a deaf ear to the call of the freedom fighters in the Baltics. We did not. In the historic year of 1991  Iceland became the first to recognize the restored sovereignty of the Baltic States. We did that out of respect for the principles that are so vitally important to small nations: the right to choose your own destiny  to carve out your own future — the undeniable right of small nations to be independent. Principles do matter in politics.  Based on the same principle that led Iceland to recognize the Baltic States in 1991  today we support the Palestinian struggle for statehood. Based on that very same principle  Iceland feels that the international community should welcome Palestine as a new Member State in the United Nations  based on the pre-1967 borders — exactly the same criteria as those laid down by the European Union  the Quartet and lately  also by President Barack Obama in his strong speech in May.  I have been to Gaza. I have talked to the people: the fishermen who no longer can ply their trade  the young people who are unemployed  the families that need a roof over their head. I have also been to the West Bank. I have seen with my own eyes how the land of the Palestinians has literally been cut to pieces by horrible walls of separation. That is wrong. That is   5 11-51390  unjust. That is against every moral code that Iceland has ever stood for as a guardian of human rights.   We must remember that Palestine today is really doing just the same thing as Israel did in 1947  and Iceland and so many other States at the time supported Israel’s action. Israel took its case to the United Nations and emerged with statehood. Palestine deserves the same. And I think it is hypocrisy to suggest otherwise. In the middle of the democratic revolution brought on by the fresh breeze of the Arabic Spring and inspired  not least  by women and young people  it would be foolish to deny Palestine its right to statehood. Such denial would act against reconciliation in the region.  It will  perhaps  not come as any surprise to Members here  but Iceland will therefore vote “yes”  when a resolution on Palestinian statehood comes to a vote in the General Assembly. Furthermore  the Icelandic Government is determined to fully recognize Palestine and will next week submit to the Parliament of Iceland a resolution on the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign and independent State.

"83",3454,"ISR",66,2011,"Israel has extended its hand in peace from the moment it was established 63 years ago. On behalf of Israel and the Jewish people  I extend that hand again today. I extend it to the people of Egypt and Jordan  with renewed friendship for neighbours with whom we have made peace. I extend it to the people of Turkey  with respect and goodwill. I extend it to the people of Libya and Tunisia  with admiration for those trying to build a democratic future. I extend it to the other peoples of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula  with whom we want to forge a new beginning. I extend it to the people of Syria  Lebanon and Iran  with awe at the courage of those fighting brutal repression.   Most especially  I extend my hand to the Palestinian people  with whom we seek a just and lasting peace.  In Israel  our hope for peace never wanes. Our scientists  doctors and innovators apply their genius to improving the world of tomorrow. Our artists and our writers enrich the heritage of humanity. Now  I know that this is not exactly the image of Israel that is often portrayed in this Hall. After all  it was here in 1975 that the age-old yearning of my people to restore our national life in our ancient biblical homeland was branded  shamefully  as racism. It was right here in 1980 that the historic peace agreement between Israel and Egypt was not praised  but denounced. It is here  year after year  that Israel is unjustly singled out for condemnation. It is singled out for condemnation more often than all the nations of the world combined. Twenty-one out of 27 relevant General Assembly resolutions condemn Israel  the one true democracy in the Middle East.   This is an unfortunate part of the United Nations institution. It is the theatre of the absurd. It not only casts Israel as the villain  it often casts real villains in leading roles. Al-Qadhafi’s Libya chaired the Commission on Human Rights. Saddam’s Iraq headed the Conference on Disarmament.   One might say that is the past. Well  here is what is happening now — right now  today. Hizbullah-controlled Lebanon now presides over the Security Council. This means  in effect  that a terror organization presides over the body entrusted with guaranteeing the world’s security. One could not make this up. Here in the United Nations  automatic majorities can decide anything. They can decide that the sun rises in the west. They can also decide — they have decided — that the Western Wall in Jerusalem  Judaism’s holiest place  is occupied Palestinian territory.  Yet  even here in the General Assembly  the truth can sometimes break through. In 1984  when I was appointed Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations  I   37 11-51185  visited the great rabbi of Lubavitch. He said to me — and I do not want anyone here to be offended  because from personal experience of serving here  I know there are many honourable men and women  many capable and decent people  serving their nations here — but here is what the rebbe said to me. He said  “You will be serving in a house of many lies”. And then he said  “Remember that  even in the darkest place  the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide”. Today I hope that the light of truth will shine  if only for a few minutes  in a Hall that for too long has been a place of darkness for my country.   As Israel’s Prime Minister  I did not come here to win applause. I came here to speak the truth. The truth is that Israel wants peace. The truth is that I want peace. The truth is that in the Middle East  at all times but especially during these turbulent days  peace must be anchored in security. The truth is that we can achieve peace not through United Nations resolutions  but only through direct negotiations between the parties. The truth is that so far the Palestinians have refused to negotiate. The truth is that Israel wants peace with a Palestinian State  but the Palestinians want a State without peace. The truth is that the Assembly should not let that happen.  When I first came here 27 years ago  the world was divided between East and West. Since then  the Cold War ended  great civilizations have risen from centuries of slumber  hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty  countless more are poised to follow  and the remarkable thing is that  so far  this monumental historic shift has largely occurred peacefully.   Yet a malignancy is now growing between East and West that threatens the peace of all. It seeks not to liberate  but to enslave; not to build  but to destroy. That malignancy is militant Islam. It cloaks itself in the mantle of a great faith  yet it murders Jews  Christians and Muslims alike with unforgiving impartiality. On 11 September 2001  it killed thousands of Americans and left the twin towers in smouldering ruins. Last night  I laid a wreath on the 9/11 memorial. It was deeply moving. However  as I was going there  one thing echoed in my mind: the outrageous words of the President of Iran at this rostrum yesterday. He implied that 9/11 was an American conspiracy. Some left this Hall; everyone should have.  Since 9/11  militant Islamists have slaughtered countless other innocents in London and Madrid  in Baghdad and Mumbai  in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem  and in every part of Israel. I believe that the greatest danger facing our world is that this fanaticism will arm itself with nuclear weapons  and that is precisely what Iran is trying to do. Can we imagine that man who ranted here yesterday armed with nuclear weapons?  The international community must stop Iran before it is too late. If Iran is not stopped  we will all face the spectre of nuclear terrorism  and the Arab Spring could soon become an Iranian winter. That would be a tragedy. Millions of Arabs have taken to the streets to replace tyranny with liberty  and no one would benefit more than Israel if those committed to freedom and peace would prevail.  That is my fervent hope  but as the Prime Minister of Israel  I cannot risk the future of the Jewish State on wishful thinking. Leaders must see reality as it is  not as it ought to be. We must do our best to shape the future  but we cannot wish away the dangers of the present.  The world around Israel is definitely becoming more dangerous. Militant Islam has already taken over Lebanon and Gaza. It is determined to tear apart the peace treaties between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Jordan. It has poisoned many Arab minds against Jews and Israel  and against America and the West. It opposes not the policies of Israel but the existence of Israel.  Now  some argue that if we want to slow down the spread of militant Islam  especially in these turbulent times  Israel must hurry to make concessions  including territorial compromises. And this theory sounds simple. Basically it goes like this: leave the territory and peace will be advanced. The moderates will be strengthened; the radicals will be kept at bay. And do not worry about the pesky details of how Israel will actually defend itself; international troops will do the job.  These people say to me constantly  “Just make a sweeping offer  and everything will work out”. There is only one problem with that theory. We have tried it and it has not worked. In 2000  Israel made a sweeping peace offer that met virtually all the Palestinian demands. Chairman Arafat rejected it. The Palestinians then launched a terror attack that claimed 1 000 Israeli lives.    11-51185 38   In 2008  Prime Minister Olmert afterwards made an even more sweeping offer. President Abbas did not even respond to it. But Israel did more than just make sweeping offers. We actually left territory. We withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 and from every square inch of Gaza in 2005. That did not calm the militant Islamic storm that threatens us. It only brought the storm closer and made it stronger. Hizbullah and Hamas fired thousands of rockets against our cities from the very territories we had vacated.   When Israel left Lebanon and Gaza  the moderates did not defeat the radicals; the moderates were devoured by the radicals. And I regret to say that international troops  including those of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the European Union Border Assistance Mission in Gaza  did not stop the radicals from attacking Israel.  We left Gaza hoping for peace. We did not freeze the settlements in Gaza; we uprooted them. We did exactly what the theory says. We got out  went back to the 1967 borders and dismantled the settlements. I do not think people remember how far we went to achieve this. We uprooted thousands of people from their homes. We pulled children out of their schools and their kindergartens. We bulldozed synagogues. We even moved loved ones from their graves. And then  having done all that  we gave the keys of Gaza to President Abbas.  The theory says that it should have all worked out  and that President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority could now build a peaceful state in Gaza. We all remember that the entire world applauded our withdrawal as an act of great statesmanship and a bold act of peace. But we did not get peace. We got war. We got Iran  which  through its proxy  Hamas  promptly kicked out the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority collapsed in a day — in one day.   President Abbas just said from this rostrum that the Palestinians are armed only with their hopes and dreams. Yes  they are armed with their hopes  dreams and 10 000 missiles and Grad rockets supplied by Iran  not to mention the river of lethal weapons now flowing into Gaza from the Sinai  from Libya and from elsewhere.  Thousands of missiles have already rained down on our cities. So it might be understand  given all this  why Israelis rightly ask  “What is to prevent this from happening again in the West Bank?” Most of the major cities in the south of our country are within a few dozen kilometres from Gaza  but in the centre of the country opposite the West Bank  our cities are a few hundred metres or at most a few kilometres from the edge of the West Bank.  So I want to ask: Would anyone here bring danger so close to their cities and families? Would they act so recklessly with the lives of their citizens? Israel is prepared to have a Palestinian State in the West Bank  but we are not prepared to have another Gaza there. And that is why we need to have real security arrangements  which the Palestinians simply refuse to negotiate with us.  Israelis remember the bitter lessons of Gaza. Many of Israel’s critics ignore them. They irresponsibly advise Israel to go down this same perilous path again. We read what these people say and it is as if nothing happened. They just repeat the same advice and the same formulas as though none of this happened. And these critics continue to press Israel to make far-reaching concessions without first assuring Israel’s security. They praise those who unwittingly feed the insatiable crocodile of militant Islam as bold statesmen. They cast as enemies of peace those of us who insist that we must first erect a sturdy barrier to keep the crocodile out  or at the very least jam an iron bar between its gaping jaws.  So in the face of the labels and the libels  Israel must heed better advice. It is better to receive bad press than a good eulogy  and better still would be a fair press whose sense of history extends beyond breakfast and that recognizes Israel’s legitimate security concerns. I believe that in serious peace negotiations  these needs and concerns can be properly addressed  but they will not be addressed without negotiations.   And the needs are many  because Israel is such a tiny country. Without Judea and Samaria — the West Bank — Israel is all of nine miles wide. I want to put that in perspective for all of us in this city. It is about two-thirds the length of Manhattan. It is the distance between Battery Park and Columbia University. And let us not forget that the people who live in Brooklyn and New Jersey are considerably nicer than some of Israel’s neighbours.   So how does one protect such a tiny country  surrounded by people sworn to its destruction and armed to the teeth by Iran? Obviously  one cannot defend it from within that narrow space alone. Israel   39 11-51185  needs greater strategic depth  and that is exactly why Security Council resolution 242 (1967) did not require Israel to leave all of the territories it captured in the Six-Day War. It talked about withdrawal from territories to secure and defensible boundaries. And to defend itself  Israel must therefore maintain a long-term Israeli military presence in critical strategic areas in the West Bank.  I explained this to President Abbas. He answered that if a Palestinian State was to be a sovereign country  it could never accept such arrangements. Why not? The United States has had troops in Japan  Germany and South Korea for more than a half a century. Britain has an air base in Cyprus. France has forces in three independent African nations. None of those States claim that they are not sovereign countries.   There are many other vital security issues that also must be addressed. Take the issue of airspace. Again  Israel’s small dimensions create huge security problems. The United States can be crossed by jet airplane in six hours. To fly across Israel  it takes three minutes. So is Israel’s tiny airspace to be chopped in half and given to a Palestinian State not at peace with Israel?   Our major international airport is a few kilometres from the West Bank. Without peace  will our planes become targets for anti-aircraft missiles placed in the adjacent Palestinian State? And how will we stop the smuggling into the West Bank? It is not merely the West Bank; it is the West Bank mountains  which dominate the coastal plain below where most of Israel’s population sits. How could we prevent the smuggling into those mountains of missiles that could be fired at our cities?   I bring up these problems because they are not theoretical problems. They are very real  and for Israelis  they are life-and-death matters. All of these potential cracks in Israel’s security have to be sealed in a peace agreement before a Palestinian State is declared  not afterwards  because if it is left until afterwards they will not be sealed. And these problems will explode in our face and explode the peace.   The Palestinians should first make peace with Israel and then get their State. But I also want to say this. After such a peace agreement is signed  Israel will not be the last country to welcome a Palestinian State as a new Member of the United Nations. We will be the first.   There is one more thing. Hamas has been violating international law by holding our soldier Gilad Shalit captive for five years. They have not allowed even one Red Cross visit. He is held in a dungeon  in darkness  against all international norms. Gilad Shalit is the son of Aviva and Noam Shalit. He is the grandson of Zvi Shalit  who escaped the Holocaust by coming to the land of Israel as a boy in the 1930s. Gilad Shalit is the son of every Israeli family. Every nation represented here should demand his immediate release. If we want to adopt a resolution about the Middle East today  that is the resolution we should adopt.   Last year in Israel at Bar-Ilan University  and this year in the Knesset and the United States Congress  I laid out my vision for peace  in which a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State. Yes  the Jewish State. After all  this is the body that recognized the Jewish State 64 years ago. Now  does the Assembly not think that it is about time that Palestinians did the same?   The Jewish State of Israel will always protect the rights of all of its minorities  including the more than 1 million Arab citizens of Israel. I wish I could say the same thing about a future Palestinian State  for as Palestinian officials made clear the other day — in fact  I think they did so right here in New York — the Palestinian State would not allow any Jews. They would be Jew-free — Judenrein. That is ethnic cleansing. There are laws today in Ramallah that make the selling of land to Jews punishable by death. That is racism. And the Assembly knows which laws this evokes.   Israel has no intention whatsoever of changing the democratic character of our State. We just do not want the Palestinians to try to change the Jewish character of our State. We want them to give up the fantasy of flooding Israel with millions of Palestinians.   President Abbas just stood here and said that the settlements lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. Well  that is odd. Our conflict was raging for nearly half a century before there was a single Israeli settlement in the West Bank. So  if what President Abbas is saying was true  then I guess that the settlements he is talking about are Tel Aviv  Haifa  Jaffa and Be?er Sheva. Maybe that is what he meant the other day when he said that Israel had been occupying    11-51185 40  Palestinian land for 63 years. He did not say from 1967; he said from 1948.   I hope that somebody will bother to ask him this question  because it illustrates a simple truth. The core of the conflict is not the settlements; the settlements are a result of the conflict. The settlements are an issue that has to be addressed and resolved in the course of negotiations. But the core of the conflict has always been  and unfortunately remains  the refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish State within any border.   I think it is time that the Palestinian leadership recognize what every serious international leader from Lord Balfour and David Lloyd George in 1917  to President Truman in 1948  to President Obama just two days ago right here  has recognized — that Israel is the Jewish State.   I would ask President Abbas to stop walking around this issue  recognize the Jewish State  and make peace with us. In such a genuine peace  Israel is prepared to make painful compromises. We believe that the Palestinians should be neither the citizens of Israel nor its subjects. They should live in a free State of their own. But they should be ready  like us  for compromise. And we will know that they are ready for compromise and peace when they start taking Israel’s security requirements seriously and when they stop denying our historical connection to our ancient homeland. I often hear them accuse Israel of Judaizing Jerusalem. That is like accusing America of Americanizing Washington  D.C.  or the British of Anglicizing London. Why are we called Jews? Because we come from Judea.   In my office in Jerusalem  there is an ancient seal. It is a signet ring of a Jewish official from the time of the Bible. The seal was found right next to the Western Wall and it dates back 2 700 years to the time of King Hezekiah. Now  the name of a Jewish official is inscribed on the ring in Hebrew. His name was Netanyahu. That is my last name. My first name  Benjamin  can be traced back a 1 000 years to Benjamin — Binyamin — the son of Jacob  who was also known as Israel. Jacob and his 12 sons roamed these same hills of Judea and Samaria 4 000 years ago  and there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the land ever since.   Those Jews who were exiled from our land — Jews in Spain  on the eve of their expulsion; Jews in Ukraine  fleeing the pogroms; Jews fighting in the Warsaw Ghetto  as the Nazis were circling around it — never stopped dreaming of coming back. They never stopped praying  they never stopped yearning. They whispered: “Next year in Jerusalem. Next year in the promised land”.   As the Prime Minister of Israel  I speak for a hundred generations of Jews who were dispersed throughout the lands and suffered every evil under the sun  but who never gave up hope of restoring their national life in the one and only Jewish State.   I continue to hope that President Abbas will be my partner in peace. I have worked hard to advance that peace. The day I came into office  I called for direct negotiations without preconditions. President Abbas did not respond. I outlined a vision of peace of two States for two peoples. He still did not respond. I removed hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints to ease freedom of movement in the Palestinian areas. This facilitated fantastic growth in the Palestinian economy. But again  there was no response. I took the unprecedented step of freezing new building in the settlements for 10 months. No Prime Minister had done that before  ever. Once again  I hear applause  but there was no response. No response.   In the past few weeks  American officials have put forward ideas to restart peace talks. There were things in those ideas about borders that I did not like. There were things there about the Jewish State that I am sure the Palestinians did not like. But despite all of my reservations  I was willing to move forward on those American ideas. Why does President Abbas not join me? We have to stop negotiating about the negotiations. Let us just get on with it. Let us negotiate peace.   I spent years defending Israel on the battlefield. I spent decades defending Israel in the court of public opinion. President Abbas has dedicated his life to advancing the Palestinian cause. Must this conflict continue for generations  or will we enable our children and our grandchildren to speak in the years ahead of how we found a way to end it? That is what we should aim for  and that is what I believe we can achieve.   In two and a half years  President Abbas and I have met in Jerusalem only once  even though my door has always been open to him. If he wishes  I will come to Ramallah. Actually  I have a better suggestion. We have both just flown thousands of miles to New York.   41 11-51185  Now we are in the same city; we are in the same building. So let us meet here today  at the United Nations. Who is there to stop us? What is there to stop us? If we genuinely want peace  what is there to stop us from meeting today and beginning peace negotiations?  I suggest that we talk openly and honestly. Let us listen to one another. Let us  as we say in the Middle East  talk dugri. That means “straightforward”. I will tell him my needs and concerns; he will tell me his. And with God’s help  we will find the common ground of peace.   There is an old Arab saying that one cannot applaud with one hand. Well  the same is true of peace. I cannot make peace alone. I cannot make peace without an interlocutor. President Abbas  I extend my hand — the hand of Israel — in peace. I hope that he will grasp that hand. We are both the sons of Abraham. My people call him Avraham; his people call him Ibrahim. We share the same patriarch. We dwell in the same land. Our destinies are intertwined. Let us realize the vision of Isaiah: “The people who walk in darkness will see a great light”. (The Holy Bible  Isaiah 9:2). Let that light be the light of peace."
"84",3501,"ITA",66,2011,"Italy has a long tradition of mediation that has shaped our history and our approach to international affairs. In the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Italian unification this year  we commemorated the vision of the founding fathers of our nation and the sacrifices of so many patriots. We also recalled the role of mediation in bridging the gap between the aspirations for independence and the reality of foreign occupation.   A century or so after unification  our vocation for mediation was fulfilled when we were among the first countries to launch the process of European pacification. We helped restore peace and prosperity to a war-torn continent by engaging Governments in dialogue rather than disputes.  Our attitude to mediation is inspired by both our history and our geography. Our territory is located right at the centre of the Mediterranean Sea  making us keenly aware that our security is not independent of that of the region surrounding us.  For decades  Italy has emphasized the need to bridge the economic and social gap between the conditions of the northern shores of the Mediterranean and the expectations of our neighbours to the south. Despite this vision  we tended to overlook the aspirations for civil and political rights of the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East  peoples so close to us geographically but far apart in terms of the rights enjoyed by our citizens.     11-51378 10   On the face of it  the approach favoured by European and the other Western countries — including the United States — was to forge partnerships with undemocratic regimes and place a priority on security  counter-terrorism cooperation and migration policy. We made a mistake.  The Arab Spring was a wake-up call  reminding us that no political leader can maintain power at the expense of his or her own people. It confirmed the principle that there can be no mediation or compromise where fundamental rights are concerned. And it showed that cooperation for the sake of security and stability is no alternative to promoting freedom  economic and democratic growth and job creation.  Our response to the uprisings was consistent with our values. We called for dialogue and deplored the use of force against civilians. That was not enough in Libya  however  where the regime had vowed to slaughter its own civilians. The only way to prevent a massacre was for the international community to invoke the principle of the responsibility to protect.  By helping to implement that decision in military  diplomatic and humanitarian terms  we shifted from a culture of sovereign impunity to one of responsible sovereignty  rooted in national and international accountability for the most serious violations of human rights. At the same time  we supported international sanctions against the Syrian leadership.  The uprisings in North Africa and in the Middle East send a message that the United Nations can do more and do better. Let me be very clear. We do not want less United Nations involvement; we want more. Libya can be the first test case for a more prominent United Nations role.   The United Nations is called upon to coordinate and lead the international community’s assistance to that country. The international community should maintain cohesion and unity of purpose  avoid a fragmented response and resist engaging in a first-past-the-post logic. There should be no competition  because there is only one winner: the Libyan people.   The United Nations should therefore chair the international coordination mechanisms  with the support of the relevant regional organizations  such as the League of Arab States  the African Union and the European Union (EU). At this juncture we need to prevent resentment and extremism from gaining ground.   We are ready to build respectful new partnerships without imposing pre-packaged models. That is why we have promoted the idea of a new Mediterranean plan for growth and development. And we have proposed a permanent conference on security and cooperation  with the goal of building an inclusive dialogue among equals on political  economic and cultural issues. If we fail to respond  and if the Arab Spring does not produce results soon  we will all have a heavy price to pay.  Never has mediation been more necessary in the tense stand-off between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Confrontation has led nowhere. The time has come to defuse this long-standing and disruptive conflict through recourse to dialogue and the building of mutual trust. We continue to strongly back American efforts  and we welcome the Quartet’s new effort to gather the necessary support to restart the negotiations between the parties towards the creation  very soon  of a strong and safe Palestinian State.   Within the European Union  which has to speak with one voice  Italy is also ready to exercise more leadership and political vision in relaunching the peace process.   In Lebanon  Italy is playing a prominent role in mediation. The Italian contingent in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was awarded the United Nations peace medal for its contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the country. This prize honours the achievements of our soldiers in Lebanon  but also the commitment of the Italian Government to peacekeeping.   Italy is the sixth top contributor to the United Nations peacekeeping operations budget and  since 2006  the top EU and Western European and Others Group contributor of troops to the United Nations.  In Africa far too many people are still grappling with the serious problems caused by regional conflicts. Those conflicts undermine stability and prosperity for millions of people  spreading the poisonous seed of terrorism and piracy.   As a witness to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between North and South Sudan  Italy welcomed the Agreement’s implementation  which has led to the birth of the new State of South   11 11-51378  Sudan. This achievement should be an incentive to settle the post-CPA arrangements without further delay.  In the Horn of Africa  Italy has a traditional commitment to contributing to peace  security and development. In the past few months  we have financed projects in many sectors: health  education  nutrition  training  governance support  peace and security. But our assistance is not enough. In Somalia people are facing starvation and humanitarian disaster. International support must be stepped up to deliver basic services to the population and foster political reconciliation.  The United Nations collective security system is adapting its structure and practices to the new challenges by making good and flexible use of its fundamental  cost-effective tools. Mediation is one of them. We are among the sponsors of the draft resolution on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  We also encourage the United Nations to play a more significant role in conflict prevention  the settlement of disputes and peacebuilding efforts. To that end  we rely on the impartiality and authority of the Secretary-General. We commend him for his leadership in crisis management  and encourage him in this noble endeavour and in his commitment to budgetary discipline.  We also commend all the efforts to promote a strong solution to the reform of the Security Council  a reform inspired by the United Nations core principles of democracy  accountability  consensus and flexibility — a reform that will gather the widest majority and with which each and every Member State can identify.  Our humanistic heritage defines the human being as the measure of all things. The principle of placing people first underpins our active support for United Nations campaigns on fundamental issues such as the abolition of the death penalty  the protection of the freedom of religion or belief and the ending of the practice of female genital mutilation. The people-first approach also entails mediation between the pressing need for modernization and the goal of improving individual quality of life.   We need to enhance food security by tackling the crucial links between speculation  inflation of food prices  and instability. We can count on the new bodies created in the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Rome-based United Nations agencies to reduce food price volatility and its very negative impact on the most vulnerable people.  We also pay close attention to urban development and environmental sustainability  promoting important international events such as the World Urban Forum  which will be held next year in Italy  and a world conference on the topic of the inter-ethnic city.  In conclusion  Italy wants to place the rights of human beings  and the environment in which we live  at the centre of society. True to this principle  Italy wants to help create and consolidate a modern humanism. There could be no better defence against the hatred and criminal intolerance that struck this city  this country and the world 10 years ago."
"85",3547,"JAM",66,2011,"I would like to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident that his extensive diplomatic experience will inform his leadership at this session. I assure him of my delegation’s full support.   During the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  we benefited from the skilled leadership of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. I wish to recognize his sterling contribution to the work of that session.  We join others in welcoming the newest Member of the United Nations family — the Republic of South Sudan. The emergence of South Sudan as a sovereign State underscores the fundamental value and relevance of the theme of this year’s General Assembly session  namely  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. We salute the tenacity of the people of South Sudan in their struggle to gain statehood after five decades of conflict. We urge all sides and factions not to allow rivalries and revenge to impede growth and development. The international community must assist South Sudan as it embarks on the daunting journey of stabilization and nation building.  We look out at a global political landscape that is marked by turbulence and uncertainty. The developments over the past several months in the Middle East and North Africa in particular are stark reminders that the legitimate aspirations of citizens for    11-51384 28  freedom  inclusive Government and respect for human rights cannot be indefinitely suppressed.  Longstanding disputes and pockets of political instability and conflict continue to fester in several parts of the world  resulting in social and economic dislocation and humanitarian crises. If the United Nations is to effectively respond to those situations of conflict  its preventive diplomacy capacity  including mediation capacity  must be strengthened.  Many conflicts have their roots in racial and religious intolerance  resulting in social exclusion  marginalization and the alienation of people. The High-level Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action against racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance  obliged us to reflect on the global community’s inadequate compliance with the objectives of the Programme of Action. Recognizing the danger in such situations of potential conflict and providing full support for the Programme are congruent with the principles implied in the theme for this session of the General Assembly.  Related to that is the continued support of the international community for the project to erect a permanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade  as a visible message of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Jamaica thanks all those countries that have contributed to the erection of the memorial and looks forward to its completion within a reasonable time frame.  Peace and development are mutually reinforcing and intrinsically linked to growth and prosperity. It is therefore important that we consciously seek to strengthen and support the role of the Peacebuilding Commission  recognizing the linkages between peacekeeping and peacebuilding and the transition from stabilization to consolidation.  The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is long overdue. It is time to end the occupation of Palestinian territory. It is time for the people of Palestine and Israel to live in peace and mutual security. Jamaica remains unwavering in its support for a just  lasting and comprehensive agreement that recognizes the Palestinian State within the pre-1967 borders and guarantees the security of Israel. The focus must now be on ending the stalemate and reviving direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. In that regard  Jamaica welcomes the declarations to the General Assembly by both Palestine and Israel of their readiness to do so.  Both sides must now re-engage in good faith  taking no action that could undermine the possibility of a durable solution. Central to that must be Israel’s cessation of settlement building and expansion in the occupied territories and  on the part of the Palestinian leadership and people  the renunciation of violence against Israel and acceptance of its right to exist. The door to peaceful negotiations will not be forever open  nor can there be a continuing delay to Palestine’s assumption of its rightful place in the global community of States.  The spread of globalization is well advanced  and our economies and growth prospects are interlinked in a vast network of economic opportunities. In these difficult financial times  developing countries are forced to take painful policy decisions aimed at recalibrating our economic plans to address immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for the fulfilment of our long-term development goals.   The balancing act that this involves can have dire consequences for our most vulnerable nationals. We all have to take ownership of our own development process and the necessary steps to provide an economic environment that is conducive to growth and prosperity. To that end  we are compelled to adopt approaches that are innovative  pro-active and collaborative. It is through adopting such approaches that many countries and regions have made significant inroads in the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  I wish to refer to the struggles of two neighbouring Caribbean countries to achieve development. Haiti  in the wake of its disruptive disaster  and in line with its successful efforts for political organization  needs the continued support of the international community to foster its development  if its democratic gains are to be consolidated. Cuba must have the space to foment its own development  free from the decades-long embargo that has slowed its growth  but not its will to improve the welfare of its people and that of other developing countries. A strong Cuban economy  integrated into the Caribbean marketplace  is essential to the region’s development.  We are faced with the reality that  although we all operate in one global economy  with the same aspirations for growth and sustainable development    29 11-51384  we do not all have the same resources or capabilities. In addition to being acutely vulnerable to the vagaries of the global economic environment  the development prospects of many developing countries are frequently undermined by environmental degradation and climate change.   Classifications that are ostensibly positive  such as our own designation as an upper-middle-income country  serve to obscure several of the development challenges that we continue to face  particularly in accessing development financing and assistance  which are critical to our development process and the attainment of the MDGs. The range of socio-economic characteristics and levels of development of countries that fall in the middle-income category is indicative of the need for us to move towards harmonization of the criteria used in classification and resources allocation.  Developing countries like ours have undertaken painful adjustments to achieve fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability within an open economy. We continue to pursue free trade agreements at the regional  hemispheric and global levels. However  the missing link to progress is the urgent need to build capacities in developing countries through infrastructure development  institution-building and expanding and enhancing productive capacity for competitiveness and to meet international quality standards.   Moving from an economy primarily driven by commodities to one that is value-added  knowledge-based  innovative and technology-driven is a transformation that  although challenging for developing countries  must be achieved. Without effective partnerships between the large and small economies for mutual benefit  balanced trade and shared growth  that is unlikely to occur.   I speak here positively of the increasing South-South cooperation that offers hope to many developing countries. We have long recognized that we can maximize our growth prospects through increased economic partnerships and investment opportunities  which ultimately lead to improvements in trade relations. Indeed  the reality is that development aid is an essential resource  which is used by developing countries to offset the financial burden involved in the execution of major development projects.   Unfortunately  much development aid and assistance to developing countries continue to fall short of the agreed goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national income  as some of our developed partners fail to meet their commitments. Closing the gap between commitment to development and the provision of resources that will facilitate the implementation of its various components requires political courage. We commend those partners who have maintained or exceeded their official development assistance targets despite their own economic challenges.  We continue to count on the support of our partners and the international community to help drive our social and development goals and to keep our safety nets in place. International financial and development assistance help to strengthen our development process and to address setbacks from external shocks on our economic planning and social investments. Development funding is critical in the recovery of our agricultural  mining and tourism industries  which are often adversely affected by climate change and the impact of natural disasters. So  too  are the transfer of technology and capacity building.  We urge our partners to recommit to the development agenda  both here at the United Nations and within the context of the Bretton Woods institutions. We reiterate our call for the reform of the international financial institutions towards increased transparency and accountability  and an increased role for the developing countries in decision-making.  We welcome the increased attention that the Group of Twenty (G-20) has paid to development issues and are encouraged by the consultative approach in its relations with the United Nations. It is imperative that the G-20’s activities in respect of development accord with the central role of the United Nations in economic development.  The Doha Development Round of trade negotiations  which began in good faith nearly a decade ago  has the potential to significantly improve the development prospects of most developing countries. We therefore urge the full re-engagement of all parties in the process  so that we might move beyond the current impasse and usher in a new era of multilateral trade relations. This must take into account the preservation of policy space and flexibility for developing countries in areas that are integral to our ability to build competitiveness and trade capacity. We remain hopeful that at the eighth Ministerial    11-51384 30  Conference  to be held in December  we will consider a package of measures as the basis for a more balanced trade regime that will serve as a catalyst for increased economic growth and prosperity worldwide. We must commit to ensuring that development remains a central objective of the negotiations.  We support coordinated and collaborative efforts within the context of the review and implementation of the Aid for Trade Initiative in support of developing countries. We will continue to work with our international partners and aid and development entities in expanding the Initiative to build on the supply-side capacity and infrastructure of developing countries  so that we can take advantage of trade opportunities and connections within the global economy.  Jamaica has embarked on an export-led trade policy with the full involvement of the business sector within the context of the World Trade Organization Trade Policy Review institutional framework. The strategic formulation of our trade policy process includes collaboration with the private sector particularly given its central role and expertise in manufacturing and exporting. Our success in trade development is strongly dependent on partnerships with the private sector as we agree to policy directives and pursue an export-led trade initiative  while being mindful of our resources and capacity to export  as well as business opportunities and market intelligence globally.  Other critical challenges such as food security  energy security  climate change  poverty and diseases  continue to demand the attention of the international community. Precisely because of their transnational character  many of these problems require multilateral cooperation and action in an inclusive framework that involves both developed and developing countries.  A year ago  world leaders gathered at the General Assembly to take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. We renewed our commitments to achieving those targets by 2015. We acknowledge the support and partnership in the midst of the global economic challenges. Nonetheless  with four years left until the 2015 deadline  we are deeply concerned at the slow pace of delivery on commitments made in several key areas  namely  ODA  trade  debt relief and access to new technologies and affordable essential medicines.  Jamaica renews the appeal made by our Prime Minister at the summit last year for an emergency programme to re-energize the MDG agenda. Without such a programme  those targets will remain elusive in 2015 and beyond. The fiscal policy requirements attached to the resources made available for developing countries through institutions like the International Monetary Fund cannot assist in meeting the MDG targets in the short run. It is therefore critical that we reinvigorate the Global Partnership for Development aligned with MDG 8. Critical also must be the channelling of resources and the fiscal space to support programmes for economic empowerment and capacity building. More concessionary loans and grants and debt-for-equity swaps should be among the instruments used.  Jamaica is on track to meet most of the MDGs despite the economic and financial challenges. Through assistance from the Global Fund  we have significantly increased access to antiretroviral drugs and reduced the rates of HIV/AIDS infection  mother-to-child transmission and AIDS mortality. At the High-level Meeting on AIDS held in June  Member States committed to bold new targets for the AIDS response  including scaling up investments. As a result of its reclassification as an upper-middle-income country  Jamaica will not be eligible to access those funds. This puts us at risk of reversing the gains made in halting the spread of HIV. We again urge that the factors used by the relevant multilateral agencies in the measurement of a country’s wealth be reviewed  as their classifications often bear no resemblance to the realities on the ground. They must more carefully take into account a country’s indebtedness and capacity to pay  as well as its fiscal capacity to finance programmes that are taken for granted in respect of middle-income countries.  We are pleased that the international community embraced the proposal made by the Caribbean Community for United Nations emphasis on non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  the silent killer of millions around the world. The High-level Meeting on NCDs last week allowed us for the first time to agree to measures to significantly reduce NCDs. The political declaration we adopted (resolution 66/2  annex)  while not as ambitious as Jamaica would have preferred  provides a good basis to address the prevention and control of NCDs. We urge the United Nations system and Member States to expeditiously implement   31 11-51384  measures to achieve the agreed targets and indicators on NCDs.  The famine in the Horn of Africa  precipitated by the worst drought in half a century  is of grave concern to us all. It has heightened our awareness of the devastating impact of natural disasters on poor developing countries. We must adopt more concrete measures on food security  building on the progress made from the World Summit on Food Security and working closely with the World Food Programme and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to strengthen international humanitarian response and assistance  particularly in areas that are prone to disasters and conflicts. The plight of starving populations  including mothers and infants in the region  must push us towards the commitments of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.  To sustain the global food market and feed our populations  we have to engage in greater investments in science and research to boost agricultural production — especially in poor rural communities — as well as to offset the effect of drought and famine. We equally have to increase investment in transport and agricultural infrastructure to facilitate the storage of food  its marketing and packaging and its transportation to marketplaces.  Speculative action in the global market  with the attendant volatility in commodity prices  has generated socio-economic tensions in various countries across the globe. The constant increases in food prices not only create further strain on the economy and on social welfare  but also threaten food security and deepen the economic challenges of countries that are already striving to recover from the global financial crisis. Jamaica therefore welcomes the initiative launched by President Sarkozy of France for the G-20 to give serious consideration to this question of financial speculation in the prices of petroleum and food at the summit to be held in November. This is a burgeoning crisis  which the United Nations must also take seriously.  Climate change presents a clear and present danger to human development  particularly in small island developing States and least developed States. Progress was made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancún last December  when common ground was reached between developed and developing countries on several key issues. We must now implement and operationalize those decisions. We remain disappointed at the slow pace of climate change financing.  The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban in December will provide yet another opportunity to forge consensus on effective adaptation and mitigation strategies within the context of an ambitious post-2012 climate change framework. A second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol is essential  and we remain optimistic that at Durban we will all demonstrate the necessary political will and seriousness of purpose to achieve that.  At the United Nations we share a common background in the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development and the 1987 report “Our Common Future” (A/42/427  annex). We share an awareness that the nations of the world are interdependent  experience interlocking crises and have a common but differently shaded responsibility. We have agreed on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. We share the conviction that inequality  poverty and the environment and environmental degradation are linked and that development and the environment are inseparable. In the light of that background  we urge a renewed commitment to the pursuit of development that is sustainable  through increased attention to all three pillars of sustainable development — the environmental  the socio-political and the economic — and a redoubling of efforts to integrate sustainable development principles at the international  regional and  most important  national levels  and   “meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. (A/42/427  annex  conclusion  para. 1)  As a small island developing State  we have a vested interest in the successful outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) to review the implementation of the commitments made 20 years ago at the Conference in Rio de Janeiro. States and regions are already assessing the progress that we have made and the gaps that persist in our efforts to chart a more sustainable course to development in the period since the 1992 Conference. Significant gaps that cause    11-51384 32  concern relate to the transfer of technology  capacity-building and the provision of additional financial resources for development.  In our efforts to strengthen the international sustainable development architecture  the emphasis should be on effectiveness  on the efficacy of institutions that not only facilitate extensive policy discussions  but that also move us towards fulfilment of the ambitious vision that we all embraced in Rio in 1992. We should also aim for institutional flexibility  which will allow us to address long-standing and emerging challenges through increased cooperation and coordination.  Rio+20 will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our commitment to Agenda 21  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and  in respect of the small island developing States  the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy on its implementation.  As host to the International Seabed Authority  Jamaica attaches great importance to ocean affairs and the law of the sea. Next year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  drawn up in Montego Bay. We encourage Member States to appropriately highlight that landmark event at the international level.  The total elimination of nuclear weapons remains an important goal for the international community. While we have taken significant steps towards achieving that goal  significant challenges remain. A number of key players remain outside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has still not entered into force. As we look towards the start of the preparatory process for the 2015 NPT Review Conference  there must be unquestionable political will to address those lingering deficiencies in our push to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.  We must continue to build on the momentum gained from last year’s special high-level meeting of the General Assembly on transnational organized crime  which addressed measures to counter the growing problem  including narco-trafficking and the illicit trade in small arms and ammunition.  Jamaica  like its partners in the Caribbean Community  continues to face severe threats to our long-term socio-economic development from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs  small arms and light weapons and ammunition. We will remain resolute in our fight against this menace both locally and abroad. We have achieved marked reductions in crime and criminal activities over the past year with our multifaceted strategy to stem the problems  as well as through the implementation of social intervention and social transformation initiatives to stem the problem of crime and violence. We continue to strengthen the capacity of our security forces and to improve our justice system  to ensure that criminals are caught and prosecuted in a court of law.   We firmly believe  however  that we will not see the full impact of those efforts without an international regime that regulates the sale and transfer of conventional weapons  in particular small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. To that end  Jamaica is committed to ensuring that the 2012 Diplomatic Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty results in a legally binding  comprehensive  objective and transparent Treaty.  In order for the United Nations to deliver on all our expectations  its organizational structure must reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. An effective response to global challenges requires a reformed and dynamic United Nations. Reform initiatives  spanning a number of years  have led to the establishment of UN-Women  the reform and strengthening of the Economic and Social Council  a more coordinated and efficient response to humanitarian crises and a change in the way we conduct our peacekeeping missions. We must continue our efforts aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly so that it can effectively carry out its role and responsibility as the chief deliberative and policymaking organ of the United Nations.  A glaring failure has been our inability to agree on reform of the Security Council to ensure that it is more democratic  responsive and reflective of today’s political environment. For more than 15 years  the debates for comprehensive and lasting reform of the Council have achieved very little. The African countries and our Latin American and Caribbean region still have no permanent seat at the table. That injustice cannot continue. Comprehensive reform can only be achieved within the intergovernmental negotiating process. Anything less will be nothing more than a continuation of the status quo.   33 11-51384   As we continue to work together to achieve sustainable development for all  it is imperative that we exercise the requisite political will and make good on our commitments to the global development agenda. The far-reaching effects of the multiple and interconnected crises of recent years have reinforced our interdependence and the important role of economic cooperation and partnerships in securing global peace and prosperity.  We must redouble our efforts to address the growing challenges of poverty  food insecurity  the rising costs of food and energy  and climate change. It is not good enough to engage in extensive deliberations  to make commitments and issue declarations without providing the means for their implementation  including financing  capacity-building and technology transfer. We must now go beyond grand statements if we are to fully realize sustainable development and rekindle the faith of the people we serve in the United Nations."
"86",3593,"JOR",66,2011,"It is an honour to return once again to this historic setting. May I warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. Jordanians well remember his distinguished tenure as Qatar’s Ambassador to Jordan. I also express my warm congratulations to the Secretary-General on his election to a second term.  This year  in my region and everywhere in the world  leaders are being asked to listen and to act; to solve today’s serious global crises in the economy  the environment  and peace; to uphold the equal dignity of all persons and  as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations  the equal rights of our nations; to create more inclusive political and economic life  especially including young people; and to prove that global justice  by peaceful process of law  is more than words: it is achievable  and achievable now.  The challenge has come to my region  and historic transformations are under way. This year  we have witnessed vast changes  both orderly transitions and tumultuous events with a high price in bloodshed and loss. But those of us who have welcomed and championed reform are hopeful. We believe that the Arab Spring can be an opportunity to institutionalize positive change — change that is necessary for a strong  secure and prosperous future. We can build on the pioneering achievements of Arab-Islamic civilization  with its core values of compassion  responsibility  tolerance and respect for others.  For my country  these opportunities are opening the door to a major revitalization of our reform effort. We want it to be an inclusive  national effort that can    11-50692 38  reach our goal of parliamentary Government. The irreversible democratic change we seek means more than establishing new structures. It means embedding a way of life: the active responsibility of participating in political parties; creating political  economic and social platforms; and working with others to realize the future our people need. It also means building reform right into reform  including the rule of law  justice and the rights and freedoms of democratic political life.  Early on  Jordan began a review of the cornerstone of our political life  the Constitution. Parliament is currently putting the final touches on amendments for ratification by both chambers. Among these key provisions are an independent constitutional court and an independent elections commission.  We in Jordan are also working with our partners to address another global danger  namely  the immense negative impact of regional conflict. The central — the single greatest driver of division and instability — is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.   We are today at a dangerous impasse. The opportunities of a year ago to move talks forward to a clear-cut endgame failed to gain momentum. Negotiations have come to a halt. Frustrations are at a peak. Even as we speak  Israeli settlement activity is ongoing  despite every ruling of international law and in the face of strong international protest.   We are seeing settlement activity in Jerusalem  although that is one of the key final status issues that can only be resolved through negotiations. It is a global concern. In my great-grandfather’s words  a sacred chain binds Muslims around the world to that holy city. I cannot overstate the crisis that would arise from harm to the holy sites of any faith or from efforts to annihilate the Arab character of East Jerusalem.  A two-State solution that ends the conflict by meeting the needs of both sides is  and can be  the only secure and lasting peace. A solution comprised of two States — a sovereign  independent and viable Palestine and Israel  accepted and secure — is the core of all major international proposals  including the Arab Peace Initiative.   All are agreed that negotiations must go forward  and soon  resolving the final status of all four key issues — borders  Jerusalem  refugees and settlements. Only then will the conflict cease to be a flashpoint for global violence  and people on both sides will be able to get on with their future in peace.  President Obama recognized that strategic imperative when he set the parameters for a solution on 19 May. The Arabs viewed these parameters positively. Israel built settlements. The Quartet  the European Union  President Sarkozy and other representatives of the international community have put workable ideas on the table. The Arab States welcomed them. Israel built settlements. That is where we find ourselves today.   We cannot teach the next generation respect for law and mutual acceptance if they see law and compromise repeatedly fail. Yet we must uphold the law  or civilization falls. We cannot teach the value of peaceful process if peaceful process repeatedly fails. Yet we must uphold peaceful process  or humankind is lost.   In this impasse  Jordan and the Arab States are holding fast to our principles of peace and law. We have come here - to the house of nations - to seek the justice of nations.  We will continue to strongly support the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to Statehood  in fulfilment of their aspirations  in accordance with United Nations resolutions and within a comprehensive and just settlement  including the resolution of all final status issues. It is their right to seek it here  in the home of nations  the United Nations. That we must all support.  We seek a new and vigorous international push  with concrete steps toward the endgame. We seek not words  not process  but a decisive end to conflict and a new beginning in peace — the peace that comes from real Statehood. We seek recognized rights for Palestinians — the rights that allow people to look forward in dignity and hope. We seek a peace that brings real security for Israelis — who will put aside their fortress mentality and achieve acceptance in their neighbourhood and the world.  Men and women everywhere share basic concerns — a better life for themselves and their families  security to plan for the future  a say in how society is organized and rights they can depend on. For too many  these hopes have been unanswered. But a new era is beginning in my region  with new   39 11-50692  opportunities to move forward in democracy  security and peace."
"87",3640,"JPN",66,2011,"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I express my gratitude to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his devoted efforts during his tenure as President of the Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. I would also like to pay my deep respects to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership. This has been a year of extraordinary challenges for Japan. A little more than six months have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake struck Japan. Nearly 20 000 people were killed or remain missing  and nearly 40 000 who were forced to evacuate continue to endure inconvenience in their daily lives. I am truly proud to see the noble spirit of the Japanese people manifest itself even amid such despair and hardship. At the same time  I have been deeply moved by the strong feelings of compassion shown by people the world over towards Japan. There are many unforgettable stories.  Ms. Rita Retnaningtyas  an Indonesian nurse candidate and trainee at the Miyagi Hospital  evacuated 120 patients from the hospital to a safer location just before the arrival of the tsunami. She stayed on at the hospital for several days  taking care of the patients in the absence of electricity and water.  In Brazil  the children of a small rural town collected change and sent their contributions to us in a tin can. I heard that  when asked why  one of the children answered that it was because Japan  a friend of Brazil  was suffering.  University students in Kenya gathered in Nairobi in memory of Japanese victims of the earthquake. They   31 11-51185  sang in chorus the popular Japanese song known outside Japan as “Sukiyaki” — whose original Japanese title reads “Let Us Walk Looking Up” — saying that they wished to deliver the song to the Japanese people.  Those are only a few such stories among tens of thousands. The world expressed friendship  solidarity and praise for the Japanese people immediately after the earthquake. On behalf of the people of Japan  I express my heartfelt gratitude for the helping hands extended from all over the world. These bonds between Japan and the international community will be forever remembered by the Japanese.  Since 11 March  the sounds of recovery have echoed throughout the Tohoku region of Japan. The Government of Japan has exerted every effort to restore and reconstruct the disaster-affected areas. The daily lives of those outside the affected areas  including the metropolitan area of Tokyo  have returned almost to normal. The infrastructure and economy of the coastal areas of Tohoku  which were washed away by the tsunami  are recovering. Damaged supply chains are close to full restoration. We have been sharply reminded of the role that Japanese companies  including small and medium-sized enterprises  play in sustaining the growth of the global economy.  We are making steady progress towards securing stable control of the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power stations of the Tokyo Electric Power Company. Currently  we are focusing our efforts on moving up the existing target period to achieve cold shutdown status by the end of this year. A number of other challenges remain to be addressed  including the removal of debris and rebuilding of the livelihoods of the Japanese people in the affected areas. We will continue to be fully engaged in the restoration and reconstruction efforts as our highest priority task so that Japan’s renewal can be realized without delay.   As the new leader of Japan  I am deeply honoured to discuss and share Japan’s ambitions for the world’s future  as well as Japan’s diplomatic vision  with all those in attendance here today at this meeting of the General Assembly.   The world is undergoing tremendous changes  including those now under way in the Middle East and North Africa  which have been brought about by the peoples’ awakening and their resulting common awareness.  Through its experience of the massive earthquake in March  Japan was again made aware of the importance of its bonds with the people of the world. We have come to fully realize the importance of the responsibility to society that is fulfilled by each individual. We have never felt more strongly the significance of promoting human security. I am resolved to implement Japanese diplomacy by working closely with all the world leaders here at the United Nations  with the determination to make a substantive contribution to overcoming the challenges that the world faces and shaping a brighter future for humanity.  Allow me to touch on Japan’s efforts to help the world economy grow. Japan has a long history of assisting developing countries to create prosperous societies through nation-building and human-resource development. From our own experience  we understand very well that the engine of economic growth is a strong middle class. In order to strengthen that middle class  we must construct a social framework within which all individuals can strengthen their capacities and develop them to the full. In this regard  Japan will continue to actively support developing countries through its official development assistance.  We must not let the current global economic uncertainty and financial unrest hamper the efforts of the international community to achieve growth. It is vital that all countries cooperate in order to bring harmony out of the current chaos. I myself am committed to doing my best as the new leader of Japan. Achieving economic growth in tandem with fiscal health is the most crucial challenge confronting the world at the present time. Japan will press ahead with its targets for restoring fiscal sustainability. Meanwhile  as we recognize that revitalizing the Japanese economy is directly linked to rebuilding the world economy  we will work on strengthening industrial infrastructure  employment and energy conservation in our efforts to achieve a full recovery from the earthquake disaster. In the mid-to-long term  we intend to further reinforce partnerships between the Japanese and other global economies. It is also important that trade activities not be disturbed by excessive currency volatility.  Furthermore  in order to help realize sustainable growth of the Japanese economy  we will work to    11-51185 32  achieve a low-carbon society and a transition to a green economy. The key to achieving these goals is technological innovation in the areas of renewable energies  saving energy and the clean use of fossil fuels  all of which are considered part of green innovation. By next summer  the Government of Japan will have created a new strategy and plan for the composition of Japan’s mid- to long-term energy use  aimed at making a bold shift on energy policy. Japan will also further improve on its excellent  safe  secure and environmentally friendly technologies  represented by energy-efficient houses and electric appliances and vehicles  contributing to the growth of the global economy and to a brighter future for all during the discussions leading up to the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.  Japan will throw all its efforts into seeking a safe and brighter future. The run-up height  which is the maximum onshore vertical height above sea level  of the tsunami that hit the Tohoku district reached as high as 40 metres  the highest in Japan in recorded history. We have learned that we must be very well prepared. In that regard  there are contributions that Japan  with such experience behind it  is uniquely qualified to make. The first lesson to be learned from Japan’s recent tragedy is the importance of international cooperation in disaster risk reduction.  We have a long history of combating and overcoming natural disasters. In fact  we have actively supported the response efforts to the disasters that have occurred in recent years in areas such as Sumatra  Sichuan in China  Haiti and New Zealand. As a country that has learned to coexist harmoniously with nature  we are prepared to share with the world our accumulated knowledge and skills. As a first step  Japan will hold an international conference in the disaster-stricken Tohoku region next year designed to improve international cooperation on coping with natural disasters. To build on the outcome of that conference  Japan proposes to host the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2015  and plans to take a leading role in the international community in creating a disaster-resistant world.  Next  Japan hopes to share its acquired knowledge and experience in the field of nuclear safety. I welcomed yesterday’s high-level meeting on this issue held at the initiative of the Secretary-General. Following the nuclear accident  Japan has implemented emergency safety measures and further strengthened its nuclear energy regulation regime. In yesterday’s meeting  I expressed my resolve to contribute positively to the reinforcement of global nuclear power safety  drawing on our experiences with the accident.  Next year  Japan will co-host an international conference with the International Atomic Energy Agency to share the results of the overall assessment of the accident in comprehensive detail  and to contribute to the various measures taken by the international community to raise standards for nuclear safety. Although some countries  regrettably  are still imposing undue restrictions on imports from Japan  our Government will continue to provide prompt  accurate and transparent information on this matter. I would request that all countries make sensible judgements based on scientific evidence.  Global threats continue to proliferate. It is essential to deal with the root causes of such threats while taking steps to address them. Japan will continue to respond to those challenges in order to ensure a brighter and more peaceful future. With regard to the issue of piracy off the coast of Somalia  Japan will remain actively engaged in combating the problem through continued deployment to the area of two destroyers and two patrol aircraft.  Japan intends to enhance its efforts to eradicate terrorism and its causes. Though a decade has passed since the 9/11 attacks  our collective sorrow has yet to heal. And in that connection  I would like to express my sincere condolences on the death of Mr. Rabbani  Chairman of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council. Japan reiterates its firm condemnation of such atrocious acts of terrorism. In order to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorism  we will continue to confront the problem with strong resolve. Japan has expressed its commitment to providing approximately $5 billion in assistance over five years beginning in 2009  focusing on security  reintegrating former insurgents into society  and development  and will continue to implement that commitment.  United Nations peacekeeping missions are being dispatched to fragile and conflict-prone States. Japan will contribute to peacebuilding efforts by actively participating in those operations. We must further improve the conditions that promote that goal. At the   33 11-51185  same time  we will do our best to achieve the ideal of a world without nuclear weapons through such efforts as the multi-country non-proliferation and disarmament initiative.  The nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pose a threat to the entire international community  and Japan continues to urge that country to take concrete steps towards resolving those issues. In particular  the abduction issue represents a violation of basic human rights. It is thus an issue of universal import and a matter of great concern for the entire international community. Japan is committed to exerting all possible efforts to achieve the return of all the victims at the earliest possible date  through strengthened coordination with other Member States.  With regard to relations between Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Japan intends to maintain its efforts to comprehensively resolve the outstanding issues of concern  settle the unfortunate past and normalize relations  in accordance with the Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration of 2007. Japan urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to take positive steps in order that our countries may have a dialogue toward this goal.  In recent years  the role of the United Nations has taken on greater significance than ever. In order for the United Nations to tackle such issues more effectively  Japan will continue to support increasing effectiveness and efficiency in reinforcing the functions of the United Nations.  Security Council reform is absolutely necessary in that respect. We must revitalize the stagnated reform process. All Member States must proactively commit to the reform with a sense of urgency. The credibility of the United Nations is at stake. Japan intends to launch substantive negotiations toward the reform with like-minded Members  in order to achieve tangible results during the current session.  As I promised moments ago  Japan will recover from the earthquake disaster and seek a peaceful  safe and brighter future  side by side with the leaders gathered here. For that purpose  Japan will maintain its contribution to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  focusing on health and education. Moreover  Japan will continue its contribution to the development of Africa by hosting the Fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in 2013. Regarding the support intended to enable developing countries to address climate change  Japan will implement its quick-start finance commitments up to next year. Japan will continue its support beyond 2012.  Today  I would like to announce Japan’s new commitments. First  I wish to congratulate the people of the Republic of South Sudan on achieving their independence  and provide assurances that Japan will extend wherever possible support for the nation-building efforts in South Sudan as well as for the consolidation of peace in the region. Japan is eager to contribute to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan in the fields in which Japan excels. From this point of view  we are preparing to dispatch Japanese Self-Defence Forces personnel to Mission Headquarters as staff officers. Japan is also interested in dispatching an engineering unit of our Self-Defence Forces  regarding which the United Nations has expressed high expectations. Japan therefore will conduct the necessary field study as early as possible.  Second  Japan will remain actively involved in the international community’s efforts with regard to humanitarian crises. One of the most pressing challenges at present is the drought in the Horn of Africa  which is directly affecting the children of the region. To mitigate this suffering as effectively as possible  Japan will provide further humanitarian aid in addition to the approximately $100 million in assistance that it has already implemented.  The last commitment I wish to announce concerns the Middle East and North Africa. Japan will support reform and democratization efforts in this region  which is now undergoing a massive change that is often referred to as the Arab Spring. To improve the employment situation and support human resources development in the region  Japan is prepared to extend an additional yen loan worth approximately $1 billion for projects that are expected to contribute to infrastructure building and industrial development.   Moreover  we will provide support to ensure fair elections in Tunisia and Egypt  where polls are scheduled to be held in autumn of this year. For a new Libya  Japan will support the country’s nation-building efforts in cooperation with the international community  utilizing its expertise and technological capacity. At the same time  Japan will deepen    11-51185 34  economic relations with Middle Eastern and North African countries by further promoting trade and investment through such means as trade insurance and export loans. As Middle East peace represents the linchpin for the peace and stability of the region  Japan will make active efforts  such as extending assistance to the Palestinians  for the realization of the two-State solution.  To conclude my statement  I will touch briefly upon what I have felt in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake. After the events of 11 March this year  I strongly felt the magnificence of a society in which each individual undertakes actions in an orderly manner  a society in which people help each other. In addition  all lines of the Tohoku shinkansen bullet trains  including a train that was running at 270 kilometres per hour at the time of the earthquake  made emergency stops safely  without causing a single injury. I believe this fact bears witness to Japan’s high level of technical advancement.  I thus believe in the strength of the Japanese people  which comes to the fore most prominently in times of crisis. I am certain that such resilience  both human and technological  which does not yield in the face of enormous difficulties  will be the very source of Japan’s future contribution to the international community.  Let us take up the challenges for the resolution of the issues confronting the world today  with strong determination to pave the way to a brighter future for humanity. As the new leader of Japan  I am determined to make progress step by step towards a more peaceful  prosperous and positive future  hand in hand with the leaders assembled here today.  The people of Japan as well as the Government are determined to overcome any and all difficulties. We will continue our contribution towards a brighter future for the people of the world.  I wish to close my statement by reiterating our firm determination."
"88",3665,"KAZ",66,2011,"I would like  on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan and on my own behalf  to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to his high and responsible office. I should also like to congratulate the Ambassador of Qatar  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. The Republic of Kazakhstan also congratulates the newest Member of the community of nations  the Republic of South Sudan  on gaining its independence.  This year  our country celebrates the twentieth anniversary of its independence. During this entire time  Kazakhstan has faithfully complied with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. First  we closed the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site  the largest in the world  thereby becoming one of the world’s first new non-nuclear States. This represents an enormous contribution on the part of my country to global peace and stability.  Secondly  we succeeded in convening the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA)  which I proposed 19 years ago in this forum. Today it includes participants from 29 countries  representing nearly half the world’s population. Last year  Kazakhstan became the first country from the Commonwealth of Independent States to chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  injecting new energy into every area of its work. We also succeeded in holding an OSCE summit in our capital  Astana  the first in 11 years. The adoption of the Astana Declaration has helped to strengthen the OSCE and its efforts to create a cooperative and indivisible security community across the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. Kazakhstan has also called for the establishment of a single platform for cooperative Eurasian security by combining the capabilities of the OSCE and CICA over the long term.  This year  Kazakhstan assumed an important duty  the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). We have focused our chairmanship’s efforts on strengthening international and regional security; continuing dialogue between the Islamic world and the West; combating Islamophobia; and enhancing programmes promoting the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The most recent test for the OIC was the humanitarian crisis in Somalia. In that regard  we succeeded in raising $350 million for programmes designed to deliver food  medical supplies and economic restoration to Somalia.  Thirdly  140 ethnic groups and 40 religious denominations live in our society in peace and harmony. Astana regularly hosts congresses of leaders of world and traditional religions. We have offered to hold such forums under the auspices of the United Nations  and they have stabilized the region. That represents our contribution to the global dialogue on confidence-building in the world.  Fourthly  our country has demonstrated a commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union  we have been able to move to the forefront in terms of the pace of reform and economic growth. In the past two decades  we have posted a 14-fold increase in per capita gross domestic product  from about $700 to about $10 000.  Fifthly  Kazakhstan has called for the adoption of a global energy and environment strategy and has put forward an ambitious “green bridge” environmental initiative. We plan to bring these ideas to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year.  The world is entering one of the most critical periods in its history. Humanity has harnessed powerful sources of energy but is powerless against the forces of nature. Enclaves of poverty and destitution are emerging  even in the wealthiest and better-off countries. It is becoming harder and harder to contain outbreaks involving ethnic and religious intolerance  even in societies with well-established traditions of tolerance.   21 11-50692   In today’s inclusive information age  there are no reliable means of protection against electronic extremism. Ten years ago  the whole world came together in the face of the terrible tragedy of 9/11. Yet no conclusive lessons have been learned from it  and the resurgence of international terrorism is evident in various parts of the world. These are the main challenges of the new century.  In that context  I would like to draw the attention of participants in this political discussion to the following.  First  we have to address issues related to global nuclear safety and security. We call for the start of the drafting of a universal declaration on a nuclear-weapon-free world. We have high hopes for the Nuclear Security Summit  scheduled to be held in Seoul in 2012. It is necessary to expand the legal framework for  and increase international control by the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency  compliance by all countries with their obligations in the area of non-proliferation.  We welcome the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We consider it important that all States that make up the Nuclear Club join that process.  Today the world faces a paradoxical situation: some are allowed to possess and upgrade nuclear weapons  while others are strictly forbidden to be engaged even in research and development. This is unjust  disproportionate and unfair. The relevant provisions of international law must thus be reviewed. The idea is to strengthen the responsibility of all States  especially nuclear-weapon States  to reduce nuclear weapons and gradually destroy their stockpiles.  Today there are no clear legal assurances to non-nuclear States by nuclear-weapon Powers. In this important dimension  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons does not work. At this stage  nuclear weapons are not a deterrent but a catalyst of an arms race.  In the twenty-first century  general curbs on the arms race can be effectively provided only by a collegial body with broad powers such as the Security Council. I also propose that we issue a collective appeal on the part of the international community to de facto nuclear-weapon States to renounce their ambitions and to accede to comprehensive treaties.  Secondly  the increasing globalization of economic processes requires a paradigm shift in the economic component of the work of the United Nations. The raison d’être of global mechanisms for currency  trade and economic regulation should be the forecasting of global crises and the elimination of their causes.  It is generally agreed today that the current global crisis was caused by deficiencies in the global financial system. However  to date no significant steps to address its flaws have been taken. Procrastination in tackling this issue will result in new and violent manifestations of the crisis and a surge of regional and global instability.  It is important to establish an effective global economic governance mechanism  with clear powers and lines of accountability involving all institutions and actors  an effective global reserve currency and tight control over speculative capital. In this context  a pact on global regulation would seem quite relevant.  The prevention of global hunger and the growing scarcity of water are other important issues.  Thirdly  information space is a sphere that is as important to the future of humanity as mineral resources  air  the aquatic world and outer space. Yet today not a single international convention or multilateral treaty governs information processes. Is that not the reason why  in practical terms  most hacker attacks on banks  businesses  Government institutions  the military and even nuclear facilities have been able to be carried out with impunity?  I consider it important to establish an international legal framework for global information space. The resolution on nine elements of a global culture of cybersecurity (resolution 57/239)  adopted by the General Assembly in 2002  could serve as a basis for such efforts.  Fourthly  the new world order is taking shape against the backdrop of increasing conflicts. It is quite significant that today the world’s total military spending is growing twice as fast as it did during the cold war — by 6 per cent a year  reaching $1.5 trillion. In this regard  my initiative to establish a United Nations peacekeeping fund  which I put forward for the first time 19 years ago  has become even more    11-50692 22  relevant. This would involve each State Member of the United Nations allotting 1 per cent of its military budget for that purpose. I urge the international community to consider this idea once again and take the required action.  Sixty-six years ago  the United Nations was founded as an organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. However  one cannot but notice how today the principle of national sovereignty and territorial integrity is being eroded. That could undermine trust between nations. Today it is essential to upgrade the norms of international law concerning the national sovereignty of States and  taking into account new realities  clearly define the bounds beyond which the involvement of the international community in the settlement of internal conflicts is warranted.  Global peace will be enhanced only if the United Nations works more closely with regional security arrangements. With respect to the Eurasian region  these are the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. It is important to ensure that the composition and the work of the Security Council adequately reflect the structure of the modern world. At the same time  the veto mechanism will guarantee that the decisions that are adopted are balanced and effective.  Kazakhstan has announced its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for 2017-2018. We count on the support of the international community in this respect.  The complex question of Palestine has been actively discussed these days. Kazakhstan supports the creation of a Palestinian State. A difficult issue  however  has been placed on the scales of history; President Obama spoke about this. For the long-suffering Palestinian people  like the Israeli people  the negotiating process has been ongoing for more than 50 years. Without independence and their own State  the Palestinians will not be able to achieve sustainable peace in the Middle East.  Each new era in the history of humanity gives rise to formidable challenges. Today  the most important task is to successfully navigate the complex global transformations of the twenty-first century. Trust and unity among all nations will be a pillar of an equitable new world order. "
"89",3712,"KEN",66,2011,"I take this opportunity to once again congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that his long years of diplomatic service and experience will be crucial in steering the work of this session to a complete success. Allow me to also congratulate His Excellency   5 11-50871  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to a second term. This demonstrates our collective trust and confidence in his leadership.  The twenty-first century presents us with new and complex security challenges arising  among other things  from a range of political  economic  financial and environmental factors. This session of the General Assembly offers opportunities to address the challenges that we face collectively. Most significant is the promotion of mediation as a tool for conflict management and the peaceful settlement of disputes between and within States.   In that context  the role of regional organizations in the mediation and resolution of conflicts is of increasing importance. On the African continent  the African Union (AU) and regional organizations such as the East African Community and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) continue to serve as significant building blocks in the search for global peace and security. As the Assembly is aware  IGAD is at the forefront of efforts to bring peace to Somalia and the Sudan. I am pleased that Kenya’s role in both cases has been  and remains  crucial.  On 9 July  we witnessed the birth of a new nation  South Sudan. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome the Republic of South Sudan to the community of nations. The independence of South Sudan and its entry into the United Nations family is the result of intense negotiations under IGAD  safeguarded by the AU and the international community. This success story exemplifies the potential of regional organizations to resolve complex and deep-rooted conflicts. I would like to reiterate Kenya’s continued commitment to engage with both the Sudan and South Sudan  through IGAD as well as bilaterally  in their efforts to resolve the outstanding issues under the just concluded Comprehensive Peace Agreement. I am confident that the leadership of both the Sudan and South Sudan will continue to demonstrate their commitment  courage and resolve in that effort. We will also maintain active support for the African Union High-level Implementation Panel on the Sudan  led by former President Thabo Mbeki.  The recent improvement in the security situation in Mogadishu gives us great optimism. This has been achieved through the concerted efforts of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG)  supported by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the international community. The exit of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu provides a unique window of opportunity for the international community to rally behind Somalia and consolidate the gains made thus far. I urge the United Nations and the international community to seize the moment  support IGAD and partner with the TFG in the efforts to restore lasting peace and stability to Somalia.   As a first step  I call upon the international community to enhance the mandate of AMISOM by providing it with the necessary enablers and resources. Only then can AMISOM have the required capacity to extend its coverage and control. In addition  we must support the TFG in the implementation of the Kampala Accord  which spells out a range of political processes necessary for the attainment of sustainable peace and development in Somalia.  The complex challenge of climate change continues to manifest itself in the Horn of Africa. As the General Assembly is aware  the region is currently experiencing the worst drought in 60 years. The drought has resulted in a severe crisis that is affecting more than 12 million people. The region is now suffering from increased environmental stress  the loss of livelihoods and intense competition for scarce resources. Moreover  the situation has sometimes led to armed conflict among neighbouring communities. This reality requires us to enhance the regional capacity for early warning systems and adequate response arrangements.  The scale of climate change and environmental degradation calls for sustained action. In that regard  Kenya hopes that the seventeenth session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Durban  will deliver on African expectations in the form of support for adaptation measures. Furthermore  Kenya believes that the international organizations working on the environment will be streamlined and given sufficient support. In that regard  the transformation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) into a specialized United Nations agency  as recommended by the AU  will be of critical importance. It is my hope that the Rio Summit scheduled for next year in Brazil will endorse this position and upgrade UNEP accordingly.  Finally  I cannot conclude my statement today without once again restating Kenya’s position on the    11-50871 6  issue of Palestine. Kenya believes in the two-State solution where the territorial integrity of Palestine within the 1967 borders is upheld and the peace and security of Israel are both assured and guaranteed. It is therefore our hope that Palestine will be welcomed into the community of nations with full membership in the United Nations."
"90",3736,"KGZ",66,2011,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his well-deserved reappointment and to wish him continued success in his high and responsible mission. It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  We welcome the newest member of our family  South Sudan  which just joined the United Nations as our 193rd Member State.  The world today is undergoing great transformations. The year-long global financial crisis gives little sign of being resolved in the near future. Even the most developed economies of the world are experiencing the most serious trials of their histories. At the same time  we are fascinated by the success of countries that only yesterday were struggling against poverty and stagnation. Humankind is experiencing changes of the most extreme kind. We believe that at this historic moment the United Nations must stay ahead of the new realities and lead humankind to positive new beginnings.  The people of Kyrgyzstan have been watching the historic developments in North Africa and the Middle East with feelings of solidarity and sincere empathy. One spring  a year before the Arab Spring  we overthrew tyranny in our own land. Our country in the heart of Central Asia has now moved from a harsh presidential form of Government to a parliamentary Government.  Last year  despite serious obstacles  Kyrgyzstan succeeded in holding what were recognized by international observers to be unprecedented  free and fair parliamentary elections and a constitutional referendum. Kyrgyzstan is now ruled by a coalition Government that  together with an active and influential parliamentary opposition  is learning to find solutions to problems in the interests of the whole of society  and not just cater to the ever-increasing demands of kleptocrats  as it did before. Mechanisms are now in place to ensure transparency in Government decision-making.     11-50865 20   The authorities’ new openness and accountability to the people have already begun to bear fruit. The economy is growing. Over the past year alone  investments in education and health care have increased significantly. A fundamental reform of the judiciary has begun. This year  on 30 October the people of Kyrgyzstan will take part in the final phase of the transitional period — the election of a new president of the Republic. In Kyrgyzstan  we want to establish a tradition of peaceful  civilized transfer of power  in accordance with the Constitution and in the interests of the people.  Before the world community  I wish from this rostrum to address my own people. Our striving for democracy and unwavering push to build an open society are at the centre of the world’s attention. The whole world is watching us. We must be worthy of and cherish the freedom that we have won at such a high price. We have no right to divide ourselves along ethnic  regional or religious lines. Pan-national unity  the rule of law  good governance  civic participation and a free press are the achievements that will help us to build a prosperous and strong country. (spoke in Kyrgyz; English text provided by the delegation)  My beloved Kyrgyz nation! Cherish your independence  preserve your unity and strengthen your democracy! (spoke in Russian)  I take this opportunity to invite Member States and international organizations to send their observers to Kyrgyzstan for the upcoming presidential election.  On the basis of our 20 years’ experience of independence  we know that the path from victory over authoritarian regimes to building a functioning democracy is not a straight or easy one. In recent decades  the wealth of the people of Kyrgyzstan  like that of the people of many other countries  has been plundered by corrupt and criminal rulers. Billions of dollars have been spirited out of the country. Dictators should be held accountable for committing crimes against their own people and should not be welcomed or provided refuge abroad.  The time has come for our Organization to develop clear standards and procedures to ensure justice and the return of embezzled funds to their rightful owners. This is not about settling personal accounts or politically motivated harassment; it is above all about delivering justice and ending impunity.  We are convinced that restoring peace and strengthening the rule of law in Afghanistan will depend less on coercive measures than on the pace and methods we use to resolve social and economic problems. We believe that the decision to withdraw international troops from Afghanistan must be taken only once the situation there has been tangibly stabilized and once the Afghan National Army and Police have sufficient capacity to assume responsibility for the security of their country and its borders.  We continue to cooperate with the international community and the United Nations system in overcoming the consequences of the last year’s clashes in the city of Osh. In this regard  I am sincerely grateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the secretariat of the Peacebuilding Fund for supporting our efforts to build sustainable peace.   Turning to the main theme of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  I wish to refer specifically to the role of women in times of crisis and to their courage and sincerity  which were praised by President Roussef from this rostrum. When peace is broken and men take up arms  it is women who often take responsibility for ending violence and restoring peaceful life in their communities. The leadership of mothers  wives and sisters can force politicians to resolve their disagreements on the basis of compromise and mutual understanding. Worldwide  women are a force for peace.   That is precisely the case in my country  where women are helping to restoring peace and enhancing democracy. One-third of the seats in Parliament are held by women. The President of the Supreme Court  the Attorney General  the President of the National Bank  ministers  governors  countless activists and local leaders are also women. I firmly believe that  under the strong leadership of Michelle Bachelet  the new  important body that is UN-Women will become a champion of women’s rights around the world.  Kyrgyzstan is concerned by the shrinking attention of the world community to global climate change. In every corner of the world  including our region  this issue has become a part of every country’s security.   21 11-50865   We have waited too long to welcome Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations. As early as 1995  Kyrgyzstan recognized Palestine along its 1967 borders  and we join the Secretary-General in his call for Israel and Palestine to return to the negotiating table. Palestine and Israel should become good neighbours on the basis of the two-State solution. The citizens of both countries must finally enjoy their right to live in their lands in peace and security. We  the nations of the world  hope for the earliest possible resolution of this long-running conflict.  My country has submitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2012-2013. The Kyrgyz Republic  as a member of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries and the group of small countries with economies in transition  and as a young democracy with a multi-confessional population  supports the need for the wider representation of all categories of countries on the Security Council. In this regard  I request Member States to support Kyrgyzstan’s candidacy to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council.   The agendas of our meetings and daily headlines are dominated by natural disasters  financial crises and political upheavals. The absence of justice  discrimination and severe violations of human rights remain a part of our lives. At the same time  however  we are witnessing with bewilderment inspiring historical changes  amazing technological progress  the eradication of previously incurable diseases and  over the course of just one generation  the lifting of hundreds of millions of people out of destitution and disenfranchisement.  In this time of change  we must do our utmost to ensure that that the young people of our planet are as knowledgeable  as optimistic and as courageous as possible in efforts to achieve prosperity  peace and security around the world. Young people are not just the future of humankind; they are also its present. Let us all open every door and create every opportunity for the growth and development of the younger generation. Tomorrow is born today!"
"91",3779,"KHM",66,2011,"At the outset  I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident that under his able leadership  our deliberations will be guided towards a successful conclusion.  I would like also to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on being unanimously chosen by the General Assembly to serve a second term as Secretary-General. The Royal Government of Cambodia acknowledges with great admiration his outstanding leadership and untiring efforts to overcome the many current global challenges.  Cambodia warmly welcomes the Republic of South Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. We will continue to dispatch more peacekeepers under with United Nations peacekeeping operations to help with humanitarian activities and demining in that friendly new State.  We live in an interconnected world where global challenges such as economic and financial crises  climate change  energy and food security  terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  among others  have become increasingly complex and continue to haunt the entire world.  The global economy remains somewhat fragile  and there are many risks and challenges to a durable exit from the crisis. The growth of the world economy has decelerated in 2011  and the global economy now faces three major challenges: sovereign debt  slow growth and social instability.   The problem of unemployment has been very severe in the advanced economies  and inflation is emerging in the developing economies. That has created havoc in many parts of the world  as continued instability in the financial sector  especially in the    11-51384 22  United States and the euro zone  has dampened global trade. That has an effect on exports  in particular of developing countries. Therefore  a wide range of policy responses and long-overdue reforms must be implemented to accelerate growth and bring the global economy out of the crisis.  The crisis has reaffirmed the importance of reform in global economic and financial governance  including strengthening the institutional role of the International Monetary Fund.   Asia has become an essential partner in the global economy and has taken the lead in advancing global recovery. For instance  Cambodia’s economy is growing  after a decline in 2008 and 2009  with an expected growth rate of 8.7 per cent this year. With strong  robust economies  East Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are well positioned to assume their responsibilities to contribute to addressing the global economic and financial crisis.  Although some significant successes have been achieved in attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  most developing countries  in particular least developed countries (LDCs)  will continue to face many huge hurdles on their path to reach the MDG targets.  Continued economic and financial instability in the developed world has exacerbated uncertainty in funding for development projects in poor countries. Persistently high fuel oil prices are straining every economic aspect of developing countries. The worsening food security situation is holding back progress in reducing malnutrition and child mortality. The burden of debt repayment constitutes another major challenge for the LDCs in meeting the MDG targets.   Faced with these tremendous challenges  poverty reduction remains the highest and foremost global priority. It requires steady economic growth and a more pro-poor policy.  In the context of the global effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals  Cambodia has been listed among the 20 countries making the most absolute progress on the MDGs. Last year it was accorded the 2010 MDG Award by the MDG Awards Committee in New York for its outstanding progress towards achievement of Goal 6.  There is no doubt that climate change  with its devastating impact worldwide  has become a constant threat to our existence. Drought and flooding have become more frequent and more severe in many parts of the world  affecting millions of people. The current horrific drought in the Horn of Africa represents another most painful tragedy caused by global warming. The threat of climate change is a reality and a huge challenge for the global community.  It is regrettable that many of the promises made during the Copenhagen and Cancún meetings of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to assist developing countries cope with climate change remain to be delivered in a timely manner. Now  while the world is facing further financial turmoil  let us not forget that actions on climate change cannot wait. Climate change is progressing every day  triggering more frequent natural disasters. The developing countries are hoping for timely support for their efforts to address  adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change and to develop clean energy. They call on the developed world to honour their commitments under the Copenhagen and Cancún conferences.  The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban  South Africa  in November must not become another delusion but a place to demonstrate our collective will to share the responsibility and to achieve a real breakthrough in facing climate change. While obstacles remain to achieving a binding accord  Cambodia hopes that the Kyoto Protocol  which is due to expire next year  will be extended during the Durban conference.  Cambodia  for its part  successfully launched its own initiative  which is called Cambodia Climate Change Alliance  in 2009  with the objective of strengthening our national institutions to deal with climate change risks. Cambodia is also implementing numerous projects within the framework of the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries while actively promoting adaptation and mitigation measures through our project to promote climate-resilient water management and agricultural practices in rural Cambodia.  Food and energy security remain major issues of global concern. Although the recent surge in energy costs has subsided  the price of fuel oil remains   23 11-51384  extremely volatile. High fuel oil prices are a major burden on poor countries  which lack financial resources and know-how to develop alternative and clean energy sources. As the world depends heavily on fuel oil  we should act in concert to prevent unruly speculation and price instability  which have devastating effects on developing countries’ efforts to reduce poverty and meet the MDG targets. It may be time to consider establishing a world body comprised of major fuel oil producers and consumers to ensure a reasonable price limit. The world should not be at the mercy of oil producers.  A more holistic approach for addressing energy security is the transfer of relevant knowledge and technology to assist developing countries in exploiting alternative sources of energy. Reduced reliance on fossil fuel will also contribute significantly to slowing the pace of global warming and climate change while reducing emissions of the harmful greenhouse gases produced by burning fuel oil.  On the other hand  energy security is closely linked to food security. Soaring fuel oil prices in recent years have not only caused food prices to rise but have also reduced land devoted to agriculture through the change to production of bioenergy as an alternative to fuel oil. A balanced approach must be taken to address that twin problem. Food insecurity is also caused and aggravated by the global financial and economic meltdown and increasing world population.  The number of undernourished people in the world remains unacceptably high. Global population growth will inevitably lead to increased demand for both energy and food.   For its part  Cambodia is doing its best to contribute to world food security by intensifying rice production as the top priority of Government policy. More and more rice will be available for export. Cambodia is also seeking to establish an association of rice exporters under the framework of the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy  comprised of five rice-exporting countries in South-East Asia: Cambodia  Laos  Myanmar  Thailand and Viet Nam. The association will contribute to stabilizing the food market and preventing speculation in food prices. With respect to global peace and security  one of today’s gravest threats to humanity is terrorism. Despite the enormous efforts made by the international community to prevent and combat acts of terrorism  such acts continue to occur daily almost everywhere in the world. No country has been spared by terrorism. Its networks comprise a vast and complex web of interlinked criminal activities  including money-laundering  weapons trafficking and organized crime.   It is therefore time for us to consider whether the antiterrorism measures adopted to date have been sufficient. Cambodia fully supports United Nations efforts to create a global coalition against terrorism. In that context  Cambodia believes that there is an urgent need to finalize the draft United Nations global counter-terrorism convention  which has been discussed for many years within the Organization. The adoption of that convention would strengthen and broaden the legal frameworks to combat those crimes against humanity.  On weapons of mass destruction  the international community has made notable progress in recent years in the area of arms control and disarmament. Cambodia welcomes the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed last year by the United States and Russia  which has made an important contribution towards eliminating weapons of mass destruction. However  existing nuclear weapon stockpiles remain a serious threat to humanity. Cambodia requests States that have not yet signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to do so as soon as possible  for we all share the responsibility to guarantee a more secure world for all.  In that context  Cambodia has participated for several years in demining operations in South Sudan  Lebanon and in other United Nations peacekeeping missions  including Chad and the Central African Republic.   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most protracted and volatile conflicts in the Middle East. Cambodia calls on the two parties to manifest political will to overcome their mutual animosity in order create an atmosphere conducive to the resumption of peace negotiations in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.    11-51384 24   Cambodia has always supported the creation of the Palestinian State based upon its 1967 borders. In that spirit  Cambodia supports the rights of Palestine to become a full Member of the United Nations at this session of the General Assembly. Moreover  it must be acknowledged that neither Palestinians nor Israelis could live anywhere else. It would therefore be far better if both peoples could live side by side in peace and as good neighbours. Cambodia sees no other solution to that issue.  The embargo against Cuba has lasted for too long. Today it is an anachronism  a terrible injustice against the Cuban people  who have been the first to suffer. That is why Cambodia is today renewing its call for lifting this embargo  which has brought the Cuban people nothing but suffering. It is time to end the sanctions and put an end to the long trial they have undergone.  Given the changes in the world of today and the multiple challenges they bring  the main bodies of the United Nations should be reformed in order to deal with the problems we currently confront. Cambodia believes that such reform must be comprehensive. If we cannot arrive at a consensus on Security Council reform today  perhaps we should move forward with reform of the General Assembly  so as to give it more power and thus enable it to play a more meaningful role in tackling the great challenges of our time  as the most representative and democratic body of the United Nations. In regard to the Security Council  reforms should ensure that it reflects the realities of today’s world through equitable distribution of representation among permanent and non-permanent members."
"92",3793,"KIR",66,2011,"I bring warm greetings from the people of Kiribati  on whose behalf I address the Assembly. I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.   We gather here every year as world leaders to represent our peoples and to discuss issues of concern to the global community. At this session our theme is the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  which is appropriate in its reminder to us that peace and security are indeed crucial to the continued harmonious existence of mankind on this planet.  As a global community we constantly face many challenges to our political  social and economic stability. Natural and human-induced disasters have caused much suffering in different regions of the world. Countries and peoples are facing all kinds of security threats from armed conflicts  terrorism  human trafficking  economic recession  climate change and its associated impacts. As a result  many communities suffer daily from increasing poverty  hunger and dislocation.  But how can all this be happening in a supposedly rational world community under the scrutiny of this global body? Is our existing Organization in its current form equipped to deal with these emerging issues  or is it time to review the structure and effectiveness of our international governance system?   The lack of progress on climate change negotiations clearly demonstrates the wide divergence    11-51191 30  of positions on the issue. I believe that unless we can approach any mediation with trust and commitment  we will be caught in the vicious circle of starting with our differences  in our obsession to protect what we perceive to be our critical national interests.  I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his comments based on his experience during his recent visit to Kiribati. His views are those of an independent observer who came  who saw and who believed. His comments are a powerful endorsement of what we  the most vulnerable countries  have been saying over the years  and my hope is that this will communicate the need for urgent action to all who possess a sense of moral responsibility. Climate change will remain the curse of our planet. Most nations perceive it to be a future event  but for the very few it is already reaching disastrous levels.  Some will argue that climate change does not fall within the conventional definition of a security threat  but that is simply because it may not be so for them at this point in time. In Kiribati  many young people go to sleep each night fearing what may happen to their homes overnight  especially during very high tides. The accelerated and continued erosion of our shoreline is destroying settlements  and as I speak  some communities are relocating on the island. I was glad that the Secretary-General was able to understand and feel for himself the sense of threat that our people and those of similarly vulnerable countries experience on a daily basis.  In the international climate-change forums there is ongoing dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to find amicable solutions to this threat. But there is an ongoing disagreement on how to address this global challenge. The question is: how much longer must we continue to argue about this? When are we going to do something about it? Our people and our children  whose lives and future are under serious threat  look to us for leadership. The urgency of the need for action cannot be overemphasized.   At Cancún  it was my understanding that there was agreement on the need for an urgent package to address the situation of the most vulnerable countries  which are now being seriously affected by the adverse impacts of climate change. Next year  we will gather again as world leaders to take stock of what we have done since the Rio Summit in 1992. It is my fervent hope that  in the light of current scientific evidence and based on the experiences of the most vulnerable countries  we as a global community will embark on bold and innovative initiatives to address the climate change challenge. I acknowledge with gratitude the adoption of resolutions 63/281 and 65/159 on the possible security implications of climate change and the protection of our global climate for present and future generations. And I thank those who saw and supported the need to classify climate change as a security issue.  In December  there will be another United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban. I acknowledge that climate change negotiations will take several years to conclude  but I also believe that there is common ground on which there is no real debate. The urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to address the more urgent adaptation needs of the most vulnerable countries is a matter on which I believe there is general consensus. But what is the point in consensus if no concrete action follows? Kiribati was one of the countries that did not sign the Copenhagen Accord because of what we saw as its serious shortcomings  but we were subsequently persuaded to associate ourselves with it on the premise that doing so would trigger the flow of much-needed adaptation funds that had been pledged. Today  we continue to await those funds.  We all want to achieve sustainable development. We are grateful to those who have continued to assist and partner with us on this journey  but our efforts at achieving sustainable growth will continue to be frustrated by external factors. Ongoing uncertainty in the global economic climate and rising food and fuel prices remain major challenges to our sustainable development efforts. On top of all that  our increasing preoccupation with the impacts of climate change will progressively dominate our national agenda.   It is no surprise  therefore  that we continue to be off track in the achievement of most of the Millennium Development Goals and the implementation of our sustainable development agenda under our national development plan. Every step we take forward we are knocked back two or three due to the many challenges we face. It is therefore imperative that climate change adaptation funds be mobilized at the earliest opportunity. Otherwise  we will be forced to divert development resources towards the most urgent adaptation needs. Therefore  as we move towards Durban  it is our hope that the Green Climate Fund can   31 11-51191  be operationalized as soon as possible to allow the most vulnerable countries to attend to their adaptation needs from new resources.  In the same vein  we believe that all nations and peoples — including Taiwan — that play a role in international affairs  including contributing to climate change  should also be part of the solution. During these difficult times  and facing challenges to our existing world order  we can ill afford to isolate any nation that has the capacity to assist in our struggles.   I believe that  as a global community  we must be united in our efforts to address any security threat to international peace and security  be it within States or between States. We need to forge consensus in our collective action to promote and maintain our collective security. Let us work together as a global community to address the many conflicts and disputes that are posing serious security challenges to our well-being  before they consume and condemn our civilization to oblivion.  In closing  I share our traditional blessing of health  peace and prosperity."
"93",3824,"KNA",66,2011,"I wish  on behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis  to express gratitude for the honour of addressing the General Assembly. I also extend on their behalf   7 11-51378  sincere congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdul-Aziz Al-Nasser on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation also wishes to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  for his leadership during a very busy and demanding session.  Our new President’s tenure coincides with a time when there is on the Assembly’s agenda a confluence of global issues with particular relevance for the small island developing States of the Caribbean.  Most delegations recently participated  for example  in the United Nations High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS  held in June; the United Nations High-level Meeting on Youth  held in July; and the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases  held a few days ago. The convening of those meetings gives ample acknowledgement of the challenges that we still face in our relentless pursuit of a healthier world  and of the pivotal role of health and social cohesion as vehicles of national and global development.  The President has the awesome responsibility of piloting us through follow-up actions resulting from those weighty deliberations. My delegation is confident of his capacity and experience for the required leadership  and assures him of our fullest support.  The President has declared as his theme for the session “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. Certainly  my delegation supports the pacific settlement of disputes  and we likewise acknowledge mediation as a preferred vehicle in preventing or settling conflicts.  In this endeavour  our small island Caribbean States would wish to be engaged in the support mechanisms in tangible ways  such as are already laid out in the provisions of such landmark resolutions as Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  which addresses the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The people of my country and my region have great respect for the idealism that gave birth to this all-important Organization. Our ideals are indeed synonymous with those of the United Nations system  and our expectations are assuredly no less stately than those of large and powerful nations.  At a time such as this  the United Nations must show its unifying character by assuring that all Member States are equipped to play a role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the building up of one another. We are our brother’s keeper.  In today’s global community  we must rely heavily on collective actions and solid partnerships  if we are to overcome the many common challenges that we face. Among those challenges are the misguided or ill-considered choices that are made by too many of our youth.  A critical and defining aspect of my country’s future  and indeed a prospect that will largely define tomorrow’s world  is our youth. It is therefore worthy of mention that youth violence has attained epidemic proportions in the Caribbean. We appreciate that youth violence is invariably symptomatic of deeper individual  community and societal issues  and that a multisectoral  integrated approach is required to redress the problem.  At the national and regional levels  States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are actively grappling with this challenge  and we are pleased to have participated in the discussions on this topic at the recent High-level Meeting. There is a need  however  to reinforce the fact that there is a role for United Nations agencies in supporting our efforts to reverse the bothersome trend of youth violence  with all its implications for many critical sectors  including security  health and development.  Accordingly  we shall be heightening our engagement with WHO  UN-HABITAT  UNICEF and other relevant United Nations and international development agencies in this endeavour.  The challenge of youth violence is also linked  to some extent  to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. While my country acknowledges the strides made in our region with respect to small arms and light weapons  through the recent adoption of the CARICOM Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons  there is still a long way to go. It is imperative  therefore  that we work together to bring a solution-focused approach to the problem of easy access to small arms and light weapons in our countries. CARICOM here calls for an arms trade treaty.  Related to this challenge is the issue of human security and development. My country is committed to    11-51378 8  working diligently at the national and regional levels  and to collaborating internationally  to improve the lives of our people.  Saint Kitts and Nevis is a relatively small country  and it is usually the small and vulnerable that are most severely impacted when global shocks and crises occur. That is why  as a region  we promote collective action to enhance our resilience  promote human security  lessen our vulnerability and build stronger economies.  Such has been our widely acclaimed best-practice approach with regard to HIV/AIDS. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds the General Assembly for convening the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has collaborated with the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV and AIDS  in keeping with its commitment to support countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals and also in ensuring that HIV prevention  care  treatment and support services are provided to all in need.  The agenda is still a full one and the challenge no less daunting than it was 10 years ago  in a region with the second highest global prevalence rate of HIV. We therefore anticipate and encourage the continued support of UNAIDS and other health and development agencies.  With regard to non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  the Caribbean can be justly proud that the initiatives in the Port of Spain Declaration of 2007 — “Uniting to Stop the Epidemic of Chronic NCDs” — which arose out of the first-ever heads of Government summit on the subject  has resonated across the globe  resulting in the just concluded High-level Meeting with a consensus on launching an international wellness revolution.  Non-communicable diseases are to a large extent preventable. It is therefore essential that the outcome document from the High-level Meeting mirrors many of the chief concerns of the Port of Spain Declaration  aimed at encouraging Governments and the private sector to collaborate on increasing avenues for exercise  healthy diets and smoke-free zones for the benefit of the general public.  A long-term reduction in the enormous costs of treating heart failure  diabetes and hypertension  and the resulting 60 per cent to 70 per cent mortality rates from NCDs  is worth the investment in protecting human capital and the development of our various regions.  I am extremely proud that the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis has the lead responsibility for human resources  health and HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean Community  and continues to play a pioneering role.  We recognize the urgent need to make good on pledges resulting from the High-level Meeting  which can only augur well for a future in which due recognition must be given to the role of health in overall development.  It would be remiss of me not to highlight the significance of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Next June  during this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  all eyes will be on the Rio deliberations aimed at achieving convergence on the social  environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable development. I fully support the main objective of the Conference  namely  securing political commitment. That is the critical factor for success throughout the Rio+20 processes and beyond.  Saint Kitts and Nevis is one of the small island developing States (SIDS) referred to in chapter 17 of Agenda 21. Throughout the past 20 years  the international community has made tremendous strides in addressing SIDS challenges to sustainable development. Regrettably  many an encouraging step forward has been offset by painful setbacks.  The effect of climate change is a bane that is felt on a daily basis in Saint Kitts and Nevis  as in other islands. The question is no longer “if” and “how”  but rather “when” and “by how much” we will be affected. We need desperately to upgrade pre-emptive measures  to counter the imminent threat of climate change.  A defined strategy to aggressively promote climate financing is highly recommended. It will be vital if our countries are to successfully address the effects of climate change without tapping into already limited and depleted resources. My delegation encourages other Member States to join the call for the full implementation of climate financing.  In addition to pursuing outcomes that benefit all States  my delegation would like to highlight certain challenges that some members of the international   9 11-51378  community face  with which the General Assembly can assist. I speak of Haiti  Antigua and Barbuda  Cuba and Taiwan.  We must ever remember Haiti  one of the most populous member States of CARICOM. We should remain acutely aware of Haiti’s trials and struggles against natural and man-made catastrophic events  unsettling social and political vicissitudes and economic hardships. Their effects have set Haiti many years behind  compared to the rate of development of other nations in the region. We therefore encourage the fulfilling of the many goodwill pledges that have been made for assistance in its reconstruction efforts.  Another CARICOM member State  Antigua and Barbuda  continues to be locked in an underdog struggle to benefit from its success before the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body. We again urge a speedy  fair and just resolution to this gaming dispute.  Also within the Caribbean  the people of our sister nation of Cuba continue to endure much hardship as the consequence of a 50-year commercial  economic and financial embargo. The Assembly and the international community have consistently called for the lifting of the embargo. Our country reiterates its call  and the call of regional neighbours and the international community  particularly the General Assembly  for a speedy redress of this matter.  Since 2009  Taiwan has been invited by the World Health Organization to attend the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer. This practice and the related arrangements have established what has been termed the WHA model  which sets a useful precedent for Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations system. It is the view of my country that in today’s highly integrated and interconnected world almost all issues demand full participation by  and cooperation among  international partners. As one of the world’s leading economic and technological powerhouses  Taiwan can contribute substantially to the international community.  We therefore urge the United Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized agencies and mechanisms  including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  I have presented some of the challenges that we encounter as a country and region  challenges to which the Assembly has itself given prominence. I have also given consideration to some of our aspirations for the sixty-sixth session and beyond. They are issues that demand collective inputs and interventions.  We are all part of the global community  and problems that permeate our tightly woven fabric invariably spread to affect us all in some way or another. It is incumbent upon us all  therefore  to ensure that the results of our collective enterprise and diligence allow for the realization of our desired goals. Surely  working together with purpose and integrity will ensure that we rise on the same tide. Let us rise together."
"94",3850,"KOR",66,2011,"I would like to begin by extending my sincere congratulations to Ambassador Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I have every confidence that under his able leadership this session will be guided to a fruitful conclusion.  May I also take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations  with unanimous support from Member States  and to thank him for the great commitment and devotion he has shown over the past five years to achieving the vision of a responsible United Nations. I have no doubt that in his second term he will make an even greater contribution to creating a stronger United Nations for a better world.  This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Republic of Korea’s membership in the United Nations. It would be no exaggeration to say that the Republic of Korea came into the world with the United Nations and grew up along with the Organization. It was under United Nations auspices that the democratic Government of the Republic of Korea was established in 1948. Through a General Assembly resolution (195 (III))  the Government of the Republic of Korea gained international recognition as the only lawful Government on the Korean peninsula. When the Korean War broke out two years later  United Nations forces played a decisive role in defending the country. In the aftermath of the war and during the years of national reconstruction  the United Nations provided us with generous economic assistance and the concept of    11-50692 32  universal human rights  thus promoting progress on both the economic and democratic fronts.  In spite of such special historic ties between the United Nations and the Republic of Korea  it was only with the end of the Cold War  in 1991  more than 40 years later  that the Republic of Korea was admitted to the United Nations. For the past 20 years  the Republic of Korea has made every effort to realize the causes and values of the United Nations. We have played an active role in various areas of international cooperation  including the global fight against poverty  sustainable development  the promotion of human rights and democracy  and the maintenance of international peace and security.  The Republic of Korea began its journey as one of the poorest countries in the world  engulfed in war and poverty  and has managed to achieve remarkable success on both the economic and democratic fronts. It may therefore be rightly said that the Republic of Korea is an exemplary international success story  fully embracing and reflecting the values espoused by the United Nations  be they those relating to democracy  human rights or development.  Now the Republic of Korea wishes to give back to the international community even more than it has received. We stand ready to extend a helping hand to those in need  providing them with appropriate support and care. We are keen to cooperate closely with the United Nations and to play a constructive role in combating the various challenges facing the international community.  Maintaining international peace and security is the fundamental responsibility of the United Nations. For the past 60 years  the United Nations has made every effort to prevent war and armed conflict in the international arena. Furthermore  it has provided varied and creative means for maintaining sustainable peace in dangerous parts of the world  from preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping to post-conflict peacebuilding. The most striking example may be in the advancement of United Nations peacekeeping operations. There has been an increase in demand for United Nations peacekeeping operations since the end of the Cold War. As a result  not only has there been an increase in the number of personnel  but the work of the operations has also become more diverse and multifaceted  extending beyond the monitoring of ceasefires to assisting in nation-building.  Peacekeeping operations offer great hope for millions of those who suffer in the midst of war and natural disasters. The Republic of Korea is proud to participate in 10 United Nations peacekeeping missions  including those in Haiti and Lebanon.  Today  while still struggling with conventional security threats  the international community faces new types of security threats  such as the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and the threat of terrorism. The international community must strengthen its non-proliferation regime in order to prevent the proliferation of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles.  Furthermore  the threat of transnational terrorism has emerged as a serious security issue that requires concerted effort from the international community  in particular since the attacks of 9/11. The Republic of Korea stands firmly against  and condemns all forms and manifestations of  terrorism. Terrorism  a vicious means to achieve political objectives by taking innocent civilian lives  cannot be justified under any circumstances. The international community must reaffirm its determination to eradicate terrorism and step up its collective counter-terrorism efforts.  The greatest threat of all  perhaps  emanates from nuclear terrorism. International cooperation is now needed more than ever to prevent it. Following the first Nuclear Security Summit in Washington  D.C.  last year  the second such summit will be held in Seoul in March 2012. The Republic of Korea is making every effort to ensure that the Summit will constitute a valuable opportunity for the international community to build a more solid system of international cooperation  which is necessary to prevent nuclear terrorism.  This year  the international community has witnessed a wave of dramatic changes sweeping across North Africa and the Middle East. The democratic movement that began in Tunisia  which then swiftly spread to Egypt and Libya  has proved that democracy is a universal value of humankind that transcends region and culture. At this very moment  the people of Syria and Yemen are taking great risks to hold aloft the torch of freedom and democracy.  Democracy is a vehicle that unites the basic values of humankind  such as freedom and equality  human rights and the rule of law. The people’s demand for democracy is their legitimate right. The   33 11-50692  international community and the United Nations must do all they can to protect these people from persecution and human rights abuses.  United Nations efforts have played a great role in the recent democratic progress in Africa. The United Nations facilitated the birth of the Republic of South Sudan through peaceful referendum  and played a crucial role in the progress of democracy in Côte d’Ivoire by realizing the transfer of power.  Nevertheless  as history has only too clearly shown  building democracy is no easy task. It is important that fledgling economies in many parts of the world become sustainable and robust. Above all  it is essential that these nations form stable Governments through elections and achieve economic development. The United Nations must be there for them.  Democracy constitutes a foundation for sustainable national development. For the Republic of Korea  economic growth and democratization have been achieved in a mutually reinforcing manner.   In the twenty-first century  in this age of globalization and communication revolution  the tide of democratization is unstoppable regardless of a nation’s economic standing.   I believe that a vibrant economy will push forward economic growth in all corners of the world. To assist developing nations pursue both democracy and economic growth is indeed the role of the United Nations.  The market economy and democracy have enabled humankind to fulfil the desire for a better life  along with the values of freedom and individual happiness. However  the growing gap between rich and poor  which unfortunately accompanies today’s highly developed market economy  calls for self-reflection vis-à-vis the capitalist system and greater public responsibility.  The growing gap between developed and developing countries should not only be addressed as a poverty issue  but should also be understood as a potential destabilizing element to international peace. Furthermore  this inequality stands against the global vision of achieving common prosperity for all humankind.  It is only when members of the international community share each other’s burden and work together in a mutually complementary manner towards a common goal that the eco-systemic development of the world can be achieved. Developed nations must help developing countries to maximize their capacity so that they can achieve economic growth and development on their own. To that end  it is important to foster a global atmosphere that is conducive to supporting the development of trade  investment  finance and human resources in developing countries.  International aid must focus on  and provide support to  areas that form the basis of economic development in developing countries  such as infrastructure and trade-related capacity building. At the same time  efforts must be made to strengthen the role of multilateral organizations  including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  in development assistance. Such efforts should be grounded in the sincere belief that the growth of developing countries will provide a valuable growth engine for all  including developed countries  by expanding global demand as a whole.  Through the global financial crisis in 2008  we have come to realize once again that we live in a highly interconnected world. A financial crisis that started in one place became global in an instant. No country was spared from the bitter sting of economic crisis. In the face of the crisis  the Group of Twenty (G-20)  a mechanism that brings together both developed and developing nations  was created.   The Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth  which was adopted last year at the G-20 Seoul Summit  and the G-20 multi-year action plan outline specific measures to realize growth that embraces developing countries as partners. As a member of the G-20  the Republic of Korea will faithfully and actively implement those measures.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  championed by the United Nations  constitute another important agenda that pursues shared growth between developed and developing nations. The Government of the Republic of Korea will be an active participant in international development cooperation as pursued by the MDGs. We will faithfully implement our plan to double our current level of official development assistance by 2015 and  drawing wisdom from our past experience  will assist developing countries in ways to build capacity to achieve genuine growth on their own.    11-50692 34   I hope that the fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to be held in Busan in November this year will provide a valuable opportunity to set a new global cooperation paradigm and partnership to effectively address new changes and challenges in international development cooperation.  The cost of reckless economic growth that ignores environmental warnings will be beyond imagination. The rise in the Earth’s temperature due to greenhouse gas emissions has caused abnormal climatic phenomena. Ecosystem damage due to the greenhouse effect is causing enormous economic damage in various parts of the world.  To protect our environment and promote growth at the same time  we must use less fossil fuel and more renewable energy  while promoting the safer use of nuclear energy. Green technology devoted to meeting these goals will create more jobs for people and will enable us to attain sustainable economic growth in decades to come.  Having designated “green growth” as a national growth paradigm in 2008  the Republic of Korea has been actively pursuing this goal. The Republic of Korea was the first country in the world to introduce the Framework Act on Low Carbon  Green Growth. We are also investing 2 per cent of our national gross development product in green sectors every year.  Another important development was the launch of the Global Green Growth Institute  which was founded by the Republic of Korea along with like-minded countries. The aim of the Institute is to share cutting-edge green technology and experience with developing countries. In so doing  developing countries will be able to join in the global green growth movement and attain economic growth and environmental protection together as one global community.  The United Nations shall have a more important role than ever to play in restoring the equilibrium in the global ecosystem and promoting shared growth in the international community. In this regard  I welcome the inclusion of “Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication” as a main theme of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. I look forward to the Conference producing a solid vision and action plan towards economically  socially and environmentally sustainable development.  The North Korean nuclear threat poses significant challenges to peace on the Korean peninsula  North-East Asia and beyond. Over the past 20 years  the Republic of Korea has made consistent diplomatic efforts  in cooperation with the international community  to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and will continue to do so.  In the twenty-first century  we must first work together if we wish to attain peace and prosperity. This is a historical trend in which the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea must take part. It is my hope to see the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea enjoy peace and prosperity by becoming a responsible member of the international community. When the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea chooses the path to mutual benefit and common prosperity  we will be ready to assist in that endeavour along with the international community. I sincerely hope that this will transform the Korean peninsula from a place of conflict and strife into a bedrock of peace in North-East Asia and the world.  Today  humankind faces a range of unprecedented transnational challenges that require closer international cooperation than ever before. At this historic moment  the United Nations will have a greater responsibility and role to play.  Over the 60 years since the establishment of the United Nations  the dynamics of international relations have been fundamentally and structurally transformed. To meet the new demands of the times and address the diverse challenges of the future  the United Nations should constantly strive to renew and reinvent itself. In particular  the Security Council should be reformed to become more democratic and accountable in order to fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and security. The Republic of Korea has been actively participating in discussions on Security Council reform. We will continue to contribute constructively to those discussions in the future.  With the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations always in our hearts  the Republic of Korea will continue to actively cooperate with the Organization to create a greater United Nations in times of change."
"95",3896,"KWT",66,2011,"At the outset  let me say that it is my pleasure to personally extend to you  Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and the people of the State of Kuwait  my most sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election represents an acknowledgement and an appreciation of the prominent stature of the fraternal State of Qatar  which has strong and distinct links and relations with my country  Kuwait. I am confident  Sir  that you will conduct the work of this session in a manner conducive to ensuring its success.  We also would like to pay tribute to the efforts of your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  on his outstanding presidency and his successful conduct of the work of the previous session.  We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General and wish him continued success.  We were pleased to see the accession by the State of South Sudan to the United Nations. Kuwait recognized the State of South Sudan on the first day of its independence. We are confident that the Government and the brotherly people of South Sudan — a people with whom we are proud to have a strong relationship — will achieve security  stability and economic development for their country.  There is no doubt that our Organization is growing more important by the day. Over the past six decades  the international arena has been the scene of numerous events and developments that have had a direct impact on international peace and security. As the most legitimate  credible and independent multilateral international mechanism  the United    11-50865 22  Nations has remained a safe haven for Member States seeking solutions to questions  problems and crises. There is a general conviction that no one country alone  no matter how powerful and capable  can face the dangers of terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  climate change  epidemics  organized crime or any challenges that do not respect or recognize geographic or national borders.  Recently  the role of the United Nations has expanded significantly. This is particularly true in connection with the humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed  whether man-made or natural. The latest example was the famine affecting the Horn of Africa as a result of drought and violence. The United Nations has been able to mobilize humanitarian aid and to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. Those actions have alleviated the suffering and saved the lives of millions.  The growing importance of the United Nations in our world today requires the improvement and strengthening of its capabilities. We must enhance its performance. This will require measures and steps to reform its major bodies  including the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council  as well as develop their functions and responsibilities to enable those bodies to carry them out efficiently and effectively. It is therefore incumbent upon all States Members of the United Nations to support the Organization  commit to implementing its resolutions and provide it with the needed financial resources  in a timely manner without any conditions. In the final analysis  the power of the United Nations is but a reflection of the support that Member States provide in pursuance of its lofty objectives and the fulfilment of its needs.  We have witnessed with great concern the developments and events in the Middle East region  such as will lead to more deterioration in its security and stability. The use of force and the acts of violence that have claimed the lives of thousands must cease so as to prevent further bloodshed. The legitimate demands of peoples for the implementation of serious and prompt political  economic and social reforms must be heeded. In that respect  the State of Kuwait supports all efforts calling for dialogue  understanding and the rejection of violence.  The State of Kuwait attaches great importance to consolidating and developing its relations with its neighbours on firm and solid grounds  based on mutual respect and common interests  as well as to promoting these relations to a level that meets the aspirations of the peoples of the region. In this context  the State of Kuwait supports the calls made on the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious and genuine confidence-building measures  to abide by the resolutions of international legitimacy  to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency so as to dispel fears and doubts surrounding its nuclear programmes  and to cooperate positively in resolving the dispute over the occupied Emirati islands according to the principles and rules of international law.  This year  the State of Kuwait celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence and the twentieth anniversary of its liberation from the Iraqi Saddami occupation. That liberation was truly considered one of the most salient successes of the United Nations in its efforts to deter aggression and eliminate its effects  based on the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of international legitimacy.  In November  Kuwait will also celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its Constitution  which codified the democracy that has become an integral part of the State of Kuwait since its establishment. That is considered one of the most outstanding achievements of the people and Government of Kuwait. Those are all historic occasions for a small peace-loving country that believes in the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and international law.   Our country relies in its relations with other States on respect for the principles of sovereignty  independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of others  as well as the settlement of all disputes by peaceful means. The State of Kuwait also seeks to overcome its painful memories by establishing strong relations of cooperation  mutual respect and good-neighbourliness with the brotherly Republic of Iraq. We deeply hope that development and stability will prevail there  and that further progress will be achieved in Iraq’s efforts to enforce security and rebuild the economy  which was destroyed by the former regime’s aggressive and expansionist policies. We reaffirm our commitment to providing all forms of support to help Iraq implement its remaining international obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions and regain its role in the regional and international sphere.   23 11-50865   More than six decades have elapsed and the United Nations remains incapable of finding a solution to the Palestinian question and of putting an end to the Israeli occupation of Arab territories. Worse  the suffering of the Palestinian people only increases with the years. Their economic and social conditions worsen  settlements expand  their lands are confiscated  their water is stolen  their homes and land are besieged  their movements are restricted and their sons and daughters are imprisoned. Most troubling of all is that the international community stands idly by  a passive spectator to Israel’s unchanging practices and policies  despite the fact that those policies not only violate the most rudimentary rules of international law and resolutions of international legitimacy  but undermine any chance to achieve peace.   Israel’s inhumane practices against our brothers in Gaza — such as the totally unjustified blockade and the deliberate destruction of infrastructure  despite continued international condemnation  to name but two — are a glaring example of Israel’s indifference to its obligations and world public opinion. The international community is therefore called upon to pursue its efforts to bring pressure to bear on Israel so that the Palestinian people enjoy their right to self-determination.   The Palestinian State must be established  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and the Israeli occupation of all the Arab territories it has occupied since 4 June 1967  including the Syrian Golan  must end. Israel must also cease its continued violations of the sovereignty of Lebanon and withdraw from all its occupied territories. We wish to renew once again our full commitment and support to the bid and endeavours of the Palestinian Authority to obtain membership in the United Nations as an independent  sovereign and full Member State.  The State of Kuwait welcomes the international reports issued by the United Nations and its agencies concerning the Millennium Development Goals adopted at the 2000 Millennium Summit and the status of their achievement. We can all be proud of the accomplishments in reducing the number of persons infected with HIV/AIDS and providing medication to greater numbers of infected people  as well as progress in fighting other communicable diseases  such as malaria and tuberculosis. However  despite those accomplishments  much remains to be done  since these accomplishments are unevenly distributed among States. Many indicators confirm that some States will not be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.   That could be attributed to a number of causes  the most obvious of which is the ongoing global economic and financial crisis and its negative impact on the majority of States  large and small  rich and poor. However  developing countries  especially the least developed  have suffered most because of the weakness and vulnerability of their economies. Their economic growth has faltered and the volume of their exports fallen  while unemployment rates have risen. At the same time  the prices of food and basic commodities have risen  exacerbating the economic and social impact of the crisis.   No sooner had the world started to recover from the economic crisis than the symptoms of another began to emerge  threatening once again the growth of the global economy. That new crisis is exemplified in the sovereign debt of the United States and a number of European countries. The international community must forge ahead in restructuring the international financial institutions in order to ensure their sustainability  improve their ability to perform their duties effectively and efficiently  and make them more representative of and fair to the countries that need their support.  The world today is in dire need of a just  fair and balanced global trading system that bridges the enormous gap between States  ensures mutual benefit and assists in integrating the economies of poor countries into the global economic system. Developed countries must also fulfil their commitments and increase their official development assistance to the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product  as agreed internationally.  In that context  the State of Kuwait will spare no effort to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to States stricken by natural disasters or to respond to appeals by the United Nations or its agencies to alleviate the suffering of the peoples of such States. We believe in the importance of the role of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian assistance  and the State of Kuwait has therefore increased its voluntary contributions to a number of international organizations and specialized agencies  such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the United Nations Central Emergency    11-50865 24  Response Fund and the International Committee of the Red Cross.   Although the State of Kuwait is a developing country  since its independence in 1961 it has followed a special policy in support of developing countries and least developed countries by extending a helping hand and providing humanitarian and development assistance when and as needed. More than 100 countries throughout the world have benefited from that assistance  which exceeds $15 billion.  The Emir of the State of Kuwait has launched several initiatives  including the decent living initiative  the initiative to support and encourage small and medium-size projects  and the initiative to develop and rebuild eastern Sudan  with a view to alleviating the suffering in many countries affected by the increase in the prices of food and energy  as well as those whose economies have been affected by the global financial crisis and have witnessed increased unemployment and poverty. Many countries have benefited from those initiatives.  The United Nations has convened numerous international conferences and adopted many resolutions  agreements and statements. It has united our visions  guided our endeavours and mobilized our resources and our potential so as to consolidate our common work to combat corruption  strengthen the rule of law and good governance  ensure respect for human rights  and empower women and bolster their role in society  inter alia.   We look forward to a more effective international role within the context of the Alliance of Civilizations initiative  in order to intensify dialogue between various civilizations  religions and cultures; disseminate the values of tolerance  moderation and mutual respect; and reject any expression of violence or extremism  which undermine our potential to work together to spread the culture of peace and abide by the lofty purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.

"96",3942,"LAO",66,2011,"The reappointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General is testimony to his able leadership and great achievements in guiding the universal Organization over the past five years. I take this opportunity once again  on behalf of the Lao Government and people  to express to him my sincere congratulations and to wish him great success in the discharge of his noble duty  especially as we seek to overcome ongoing multiple crises and challenges.  In the same vein  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is pleased to work closely with all the States Members of the United Nations at this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly under the presidency of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  a veteran diplomat with extensive experience in international affairs and diplomacy. I also commend Mr. Joseph Deiss on his success as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.   39 11-51384   Like other delegations  I welcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations.  The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has always stood firm in upholding the peaceful settlement of disputes and in preserving international peace and security in view of creating an environment conducive to the promotion of development cooperation. In this connection  in recent decades the Lao Government has continued to pursue a consistent foreign policy of peace  independence  friendship and cooperation aimed at ensuring tangible benefits for the Lao people  thus contributing to maintaining regional and international peace and security. This policy direction was reaffirmed at the Ninth Congress of the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party held in March. By pursuing this policy in response to external challenges  over the past decades the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has firmly upheld and maintained political stability and social order  thereby laying a solid foundation for continued economic development and social progress. As a result  we have achieved considerable progress in social advancement and poverty reduction.    For the next five years  the Government has identified immediate and medium-term targets to accelerate economic development in all aspects so as to build a strong basis for the implementation of the national strategy to transform the country into an industrialized and modernized nation and achieve the ultimate goal for graduating from least developed country status by 2020.  In this globalizing and integrated world  all nations big and small  rich and poor  have become more interdependent than ever. None of us can survive in isolation from the international community. Although the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has in the past recorded satisfactory achievements in its national socio-economic development endeavour  the country will continue to confront daunting challenges. As a small  least developed nation  the country has been vulnerable to external shocks. Therefore  it shares with other countries the desire to reside in a peaceful and secured world.   That being said  all nations must continue to enhance development cooperation  to ensure tangible benefits for their peoples based on mutual respect  solidarity  understanding and assistance  and avoid the use of threat  interference and force. Nevertheless  it is unfortunate that we have faced multiple challenges over the past year caused by regional conflicts  and spreading social unrest  coupled with financial and economic crisis and devastating natural disasters  which have become more frequent. All this has posed severe threats to global peace  stability  security and development cooperation.   Against this backdrop  these multiple challenges are not only obstructing developing countries  the least developed in particular  in pursuing their national development efforts and achieving the international development goals  but are also further reversing development.  In such circumstances  we believe that the United Nations  as the only universal Organization  should further enhance its role in order to address the challenges in a more timely and just manner in response to the common aspirations of all Member States. Towards this end  we must accelerate the United Nations reform process  which has been pending for years  to achieve a more concrete outcome. It is more critical than ever for all Member States to enhance our cooperation in a sincere and trustworthy manner  without taking advantage of one another  in the effort to reform the United Nations bodies and improve their effectiveness.  Security and political stability remain critical to advancing the socio-economic development of all regions. The United Nations should therefore play a more critical role in maintaining international peace and security by effectively carrying out its duty to address regional conflicts  especially with regard to the situation in the Middle East  which has gone unresolved for decades. Against this backdrop  the United Nations should play a more effective facilitating role in urging all parties concerned to find a solution and realize the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security and within internationally recognized borders  as stipulated in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic supports Palestine’s application on 23 September for full membership in the United Nations.  Another important concern remains the issue of the economic  trade and financial embargo imposed on Cuba for several decades  which has seriously affected the Cuban people. We believe that it is now time for that embargo to be lifted unconditionally.    11-51384 40   Peace and security in South-East Asia have contributed to creating an environment conducive to the socio-economic advancement of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At present  ASEAN is continuing its efforts to accelerate community-building by 2015 based on three pillars: the ASEAN Political-Security Community  the ASEAN Economic Community and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Indeed  we have made steady progress in our common endeavour.   In its community-building efforts  ASEAN aims to implement free trade areas among its 10 member countries  as well as between ASEAN and its dialogue partners. In the same vein  our organization has further strengthened its external cooperation by maintaining ASEAN centrality in all ASEAN-initiated frameworks  such as ASEAN+1  ASEAN+3  the ASEAN Regional Forum  the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus and the East Asia Summit. In addition  ASEAN has started to discuss its long-term vision and role beyond the year 2015. All of this has contributed to maintaining peace  stability and development cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the world at large.  The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is another important mechanism for facilitating international cooperation. Over the past 15 years  ASEM has developed remarkably and become an important forum for leaders to consider measures to respond to emerging regional and global challenges. In that context  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is honoured that ASEAN member countries have entrusted it with hosting the ninth ASEM Summit  to be held early in November 2012 in Vientiane  its capital. The Lao Government has made the preparations for the Summit a top priority. In that regard  I take this opportunity to invite the leaders of ASEM member countries to attend the Summit. It will provide an excellent opportunity for leaders from the two regions to discuss important issues related to promoting peace and enhancing effective cooperation among the countries of Asia and Europe in this new era.  Socio-economic development in a country that has suffered the consequences and legacy of war has never been easy. One of the main obstacles and hindrances to our efforts to advance socio-economic development is unexploded ordnance  which continues to have an extensive and serious negative impact on the livelihoods of the Lao people  both directly and indirectly. The Lao Government has made every effort and mobilized financial means to clear the contaminated areas  particularly agricultural and inhabitable lands across the country  as well as to raise public awareness and help victims to reintegrate into society.   In discharging its duties as President of the First Meeting of States Parties to the Conference on Cluster Munitions  over the past year the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has received invaluable support and assistance from the international community  including States parties and non-State parties  international organizations  in particular the United Nations Development Programme  civil society organizations and international non-governmental organizations. All have contributed to the early implementation of this humanitarian Convention.   On that note  on behalf of the Lao Government and people  as well as on my own behalf  I would like to express my most sincere appreciation to all countries and international organizations for their support and assistance. These were clearly reflected in the broad participation in the First Meeting of States Parties  which was hosted by the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in November 2010. Furthermore  I would like to congratulate those countries that have ratified or acceded to the Convention. The number of States parties to the Convention has now increased to 63. I hope that other countries that are not yet States parties will consider acceding to it in the near future. It is more crucial than ever that the international community seize the opportunity to fulfil its obligation to promote and enhance cooperation as a means of addressing pressing challenges  which no country can do on its own. Against that backdrop  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms its consistent determination to work closely with the international community  thereby helping to make this world a peaceful  equal and just place  free of fear and deprivation. I am convinced that close cooperation and mutual assistance will enable us all to achieve our common goals."
"97",3985,"LBN",66,2011,"First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  especially since you represent a brotherly country that has constantly shown solidarity with Lebanon and has played a key role in advancing agreement and mutual understanding in the Doha Agreement and in Lebanon’s reconstruction. I do this hoping that our deliberations will contribute to   29 11-50692  shedding light on rightful causes and buttressing the logic of justice.  This year’s General Assembly is held in a context dominated by major Arab developments and the rightful Palestinian endeavour for the State of Palestine to be recognized and to obtain full membership in the United Nations. In addition  there are other issues such as the persistent tensions on the Korean peninsula  natural disasters that threaten different parts of the world and the persistence of the phenomenon of terrorism as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 11 September attacks  which we strongly condemn.  I stand before the General Assembly today as the representative of a country that since its inception has carried the message of freedom  concord and moderation. Lebanon strives to consecrate and consolidate that message  in spite of the challenges and threats  both in the East and the West  to models of coexistence and cultural diversity. In accordance with its Constitution  Lebanon is “a parliamentary democratic republic based on respect for civil liberties  especially the freedom of opinion and belief”. Moreover  “[t]he people are the source of authority and sovereignty; they shall exercise these powers through the constitutional institutions”.   Indeed  Lebanon has committed itself to those principles  to the devolution of power and to the participation of all religious communities in the management of public affairs  in spite of the wars and aggression it has suffered over decades. Moreover  Lebanon has always been committed to respecting legitimate international decisions and resolutions  including those of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon  as the ministerial statements of the successive Lebanese Cabinets have asserted.  Over the past months  the Arab region has witnessed events and mass popular movements calling for freedom  democracy and the establishment of the rule of law  rejecting authoritarianism  favouritism and corruption. Lebanese intellectuals  members of the media and activists have championed and laboured for every movement of reawakening in the Levant  to make the region a beacon of revitalization. Along with them  Lebanon welcomes any peaceful approach or means to achieve reform  to consecrate the principles of democracy  justice and modernity and to preserve human dignity and fundamental freedoms.   Only through those principles and systems can security and peace for all segments of our societies be achieved and an environment conducive to sound human development be ensured. We must respond to the recent upwellings and changes in the Arab world in such a way that they serve its common good  foster its progress and dignity and prevent it from veering towards extremism  chaos  fragmentation and religious or sectarian division.  At the same time  it must be brought to the attention of the international community that the wave of popular protest that has arisen in some Arab countries cannot be perceived as stemming simply from demands to improve living conditions. Therefore  allocating funds to support economic and social development in Arab countries undergoing transition is not by itself sufficient to promote democracy  moderation and openness. Indeed  means should be explored to dispel feelings of injustice and oppression rankling in the hearts of Arab peoples  who have been marginalized for decades  their development and growth impeded by Israeli practices and threats  on one hand  and by their exclusion from the tide of modernity and globalization  on the other.   Any such approaches require serious  determined efforts — within the framework of an integrated process — to impose a just and comprehensive solution to all aspects of the conflict in the Middle East  based on international resolutions  the Madrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative in all its provisions. That would lay the foundation for a broader dialogue and understanding between the East and the West and among civilizations  cultures and religions. Such an understanding is historically overdue  after decades marked by feelings of injustice and hostility  destructive wars and missed opportunities.  In that connection  it is important to underscore the right and just Palestinian effort to earn full recognition of the State of Palestine and for its full membership in the United Nations  in accordance with the right to self-determination. Lebanon will work for the success of those efforts  with the coordination and cooperation of brotherly and friendly countries. However  recognition of the Palestinian State and its accession to the United Nations  though greatly important  would neither restore full rights to the Palestinians nor represent a final solution to the Palestinian question.    11-50692 30   Until a final and just political solution to the question of Palestine is reached — one guaranteeing the Palestinian refugees’ right of return — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains responsible for the relief of Palestinian refugees  in cooperation with the host countries. Along with our Palestinian brothers  Lebanon rejects any form of permanent settlement of those refugees. For that reason the UNRWA budget must be constantly maintained. The Agency must not be merged with other United Nations bodies  which would weaken its capacity.  In another context  Lebanon has recognized the Libyan National Transitional Council  and it expects Libyan officials  with whom it is communicating for this purpose  to uncover the fate of Imam Musa al-Sadr and his two companions  who were made to disappear in Libya during an official visit in 1978.  A few days ago  Lebanon hosted the Second Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  which concluded with the 2011 Beirut Declaration. That was a defining moment in the implementation of the Convention. Humanitarian considerations are at the heart of international concern about cluster munitions. The Meeting highlighted the terrible human fallout of those weapons  which were used heavily by Israel during its aggression of July 2006. To this day  those weapons threaten civilians on their farmlands and innocent children at play in open fields in South Lebanon.   Israel should be condemned for its use of those weapons  and appropriate compensation should be demanded for the extensive property damage and harm to people it has caused Lebanon with those weapons. Israel should compensate as well for the overall damage caused by its repeated aggression against Lebanon  including damage caused by the oil slick that resulted from the Israeli bombardment of the Jiyeh Power Station in the summer of 2006.  On the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  Lebanon reiterates its commitment to persevere in implementing that resolution. Lebanon calls once again on the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel to abide by all its provisions. Those provisions require Israel to halt its daily violations of Lebanese sovereignty and to withdraw immediately from Lebanese territories that it still occupies in the northern part of Al-Ghajar village  the Shaba’a farms and the hills of Kfar Shouba. Furthermore  Israel must cease its persistent threats against Lebanon and its infrastructure and its endeavours to destabilize the country through its spying networks and recruitment of agents. Meanwhile  we maintain our right to liberate or retrieve all of our occupied territories through all legitimate available means.  On the other hand  we emphasize that we strongly uphold our full sovereign and economic rights over our territorial waters and exclusive economic zone and our freedom to exploit our natural resources  be they on land or in the deep sea  free from any designs or threats.   We have addressed to the Secretary-General an extensive correspondence setting out the boundaries of our territorial waters and the legitimacy of our territorial rights. Specifically  we laid out the geographic coordinates of the southern and south-western borders of Lebanon’s exclusive economic zone. We raised particular objections to Israeli violations and aggression that violate those rights. Furthermore  as we warned against any initiative to exploit the resources of the disputed maritime zones  we asked the Secretary-General to take all measures he deems appropriate to avoid any conflict.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the crucial role in south Lebanon of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) carried out in coordination and full cooperation with the Lebanese Army. I would also like to commend the dedication of UNIFIL commanders and staff in carrying out the mission they have been entrusted with  as well as the immense sacrifices they have made in the service of peace.  While we thank those countries that have contributed military personnel and material for their continued commitment  in spite of the challenges they have encountered  we also firmly condemn the terrorist attacks in recent months on international forces  particularly the French and Italian battalions. We are working earnestly to pursue the perpetrators and bring them to justice and to prevent any recurrence of such incidents.  The United Nations has played an ever-growing role in maintaining international peace and security and in intervening to resolve disputes in many troubled regions of the world. So far  however  it has been   31 11-50692  unable to show effectiveness in the Middle East  where grave dangers still threaten international peace and security as a result of Israel’s ongoing defiance of resolutions of international legitimacy; its unacceptable rejection of the basic conditions required for peace; and its persistence in conducting abusive practices in Gaza and the occupied territories  such as the illegal construction of settlements and violations of human rights.  This demands that negotiations on reform of the Security Council come to fruition  so that the Council can be brought more into line with the new geopolitical situation and be capable of ensuring the implementation of its binding resolutions.  In conclusion  as we celebrate the centenary of International Women’s Day this year  we must take greater advantage of the potential and talents of half of humankind  rather than merely seeking to enshrine gender equality in principle. Women are making an enormous contribution to raising and educating the younger generation  promoting peace  reducing poverty  hunger  disease and environmental degradation  and promoting sustainable development opportunities.  The general debate in the Assembly is an occasion for all of us to renew the vows we made in 1945 in order to address the challenges and crises facing us — by working through institutions of international legitimacy and agreed collective solutions  in conformity with the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations  its resolutions and the provisions of international law  provided that they are based on the spirit of justice and avoid double standards. History has taught us that this choice is the one and only reasonable solution."
"98",4031,"LBR",66,2011,"Liberia congratulates you  Mr. President  on your election to the important office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident that you will steer the work of this session in a manner which brings pride to your great country  the State of Qatar. Mr. President  we wish you well and pledge Liberia’s full support to you in pursuit of the priorities which you have identified.  Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  for the effective manner in which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His sound and outstanding leadership enabled the session to register many achievements.  We warmly congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his unanimous re-election  and extend the highest commendation to him for his vision and foresight  and for the tireless efforts with which he continues to administer the Organization. We embrace the priorities which he has set for his second term  which are centred on sustainable development.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome and congratulate the Republic of South Sudan upon its admission as the 193rd Member of the United Nations and to assure it of Liberia’s friendship  support and solidarity.  The theme chosen for this year’s general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  could not have been selected at a more opportune time. Communities within our world continue to be polarized by conflicts which have their roots in political marginalization and socio-economic inequities. Despite global interdependence  inter-State relations are still constrained by divergent ideological convictions and structural inequalities in the global economic system. These have resulted in divisions which undermine our efforts to move as one global community towards sustainable development.  Mediation  as part of preventive diplomacy  is indeed a powerful dispute-resolution mechanism. The United Nations has a central role in promoting mediation in pursuit of peace. The good offices of the Secretary-General remain critical to the mediation efforts of the United Nations. Regional and subregional organizations are assuming an increasingly active and complementary role in mediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. These initiatives must not only be acknowledged and encouraged but also supported by the global community.    11-51384 8   As a post-conflict country  Liberia has benefited immensely from numerous mediation efforts that include national  regional and international initiatives aimed at restoring and maintaining stability in the country. Our experience leads us to suggest that greater emphasis be placed on preventive measures  and that the tools of mediation be employed as soon as early warning signs of conflict emerge. The benefits of establishing an early-warning system that will deal with potentially explosive situations before they degenerate into full-blown infernos are obvious.  It has been nearly a decade since this body and friendly nations intervened to restore Liberia to normalcy. That intervention ended a disastrous 14-year civil war and created conditions for the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL)  the establishment of a transitional Government and the democratic election of Africa’s first female President.  Consistent with our commitment to national recovery and post-war reconstruction  we have developed programmes and policies specifically aimed at lifting Liberians to higher levels of productivity  reviving basic services  restoring infrastructure and re-establishing the rule of law. Overall  we are making progress on all of these fronts and building a more inclusive society in which the full potential of all of our citizens can be harnessed.  In this endeavour  special emphasis has been placed on the empowerment of women and their participation in all aspects of the national endeavour. A well-crafted gender policy is enabling the Government to address the concerns of women and girls. We consider the creation of the gender entity UN-Women to be an important positive development in the context of the United Nations effort to promote women’s empowerment. Liberia pledges its fullest support for the success of this important body.  Cognizant that youths constitute the highest percentage of our population  we are committed to developing programmes that will strengthen and empower them for future leadership. We hope that the action plan adopted by the recent United Nations High-level Meeting on Youth will garner international support for our youth programmes.  We are continuing to progress in our efforts to reform our security sector. Special attention is focused on building the capacity of the Liberian National Police. However  we remain deeply concerned about events affecting security in the Mano River Basin. That is why we are thankful to the Security Council for extending the mandate of UNMIL.  Liberia is pleased to have been placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). The Liberia configuration of the PBC and the Peacebuilding Support Office have worked with the Liberian Government and other stakeholders in developing the Liberia priority plan  which focuses on security-sector reform  strengthening the rule of law and accelerating national reconciliation.  I would like at this juncture to thank His Excellency Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein  Permanent Representative of Jordan and Chairman of the Liberia configuration  and the configuration’s members for their commitment and dedication. In the same spirit  I also commend His Excellency Mr. Eugène-Richard Gasana  Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission  and its members for their support for the configuration.  We would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the significant role being played by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the maintenance of peace and security in the subregion. ECOWAS member States are contributing tangibly to peacebuilding in Liberia by strengthening capacity  especially in the technical area. We are also collaborating as a subregion in addressing the common problems of transnational organized crime  human and drug trafficking  and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.  Liberia is poised to conduct another democratic election on 11 October. It will test our commitment to democratic governance and peaceful coexistence. Every action is being taken to ensure that the elections are free  fair  transparent and credible. We invite the international community to observe and monitor these elections.  Despite the significant gains made in improving the living conditions of our people  we realize that far more needs to be done to fully meet their aspirations. However  negative economic forces continue to hamper global growth. This situation has had repercussions for all countries. Although the resulting effects have impacted developing countries generally  those most affected are in Africa  where the crippling effects of external debt  deteriorating terms of trade  decline in investment and capital flows are debilitating.   9 11-51384   Mr. Cancela (Uruguay)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Post-conflict countries are even more severely affected. This is why we have particular appreciation for the outcome of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) convened in Istanbul in May. We hope that the Istanbul Programme of Action will bring real change for LDCs.  Food security remains a concern for many developing countries. The World Bank estimates that 44 million people have slipped into poverty since June because of rising food prices. This unfortunate situation should be addressed with urgency. We must act now  effectively and cooperatively  to roll back the adverse impacts of rising food prices and protect communities.  Our Government is responding to the current rise in food prices with immediate action under the policy Ending Hunger in Liberia  which aims to strengthen the entire agricultural food chain from securing quality seeds for farming in productive lowlands to connecting farmers to local markets and eventually to regional and global ones. Simultaneously  we are deepening our partnership with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and other United Nations bodies for long-term investments in mechanized agriculture to achieve food security in Liberia.  While we seek food security  we are equally mindful of the need for health security. Liberia is among countries with the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world. This is due primarily to the lack of skilled health workers  poor health delivery systems and inadequate medicines and supplies. This is why we welcome the new initiative of the Secretary-General aimed at improving the health of women and children.  I wish to state my country’s position on some of the prevailing situations that threaten peace  security and international cooperation in our world. The unresolved riddle in Somalia presents a strong challenge to the United Nations in relieving the Somali people of the tragedy and cruelty they have endured for many years. The phenomenon of famine has exacerbated the situation in that country and affected livelihoods in the Horn and East Africa. Those circumstances necessitate an urgent call for action.  The question of peace in the Middle East has hovered over the world for far too long. Liberia believes that whether deliberations take place in the Security Council or the General Assembly  dialogue between the parties remains the most viable option for ending the stalemate towards an independent Palestine. We therefore call on Israel and Palestine to demonstrate a concrete commitment to engaging each other in a constructive dialogue that will achieve the desired two-State solution.  Suppressive actions by Governments to frustrate the desire of their people for democratic reforms must never be condoned because they undermine international peace and security. Coherent and concrete actions by the Security Council are critical in addressing those situations. Liberia welcomes the new leadership of Libya under the National Transitional Council (NTC). After more than four decades of suppression  the Libyan people have high expectations for the restoration of their freedom and liberties. We encourage the NTC to move quickly to restore Libya to normalcy by establishing an inclusive transitional Government that will organize democratic elections.  As the United Nations grows in membership and experience  Liberia joins other nations in calling for a more democratic Security Council that reflects realities of the twenty-first century. Africa expects to have greater representation in a reformed Security Council. More broadly  we encourage the Secretary-General’s continuing effort to modernize the organization.  Finally  it is my hope that Member States will work together to advance the cause of our common humanity  and make the world a better place in which to live."
"99",4076,"LBY",66,2011,"At the outset  allow me to thank most sincerely the Ambassador of sisterly Qatar on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I should like also to thank Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second term as Secretary-General.  I stand before the Assembly today feeling sadness and awe at the loss of the more than 30 000 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for my country. Their sacred blood was shed to write a new history for the new Libya. By the same token  I bow before the mothers who now know that their sons’ sacrifice was just and rightful. Had the same events been repeated  mothers  fathers  sons and daughters would have done the same    47 11-51360  in order to write the new history. From this rostrum  let me salute all the martyrs whose blood was shed  and all the mothers and fathers in Libya. I also salute the thousands of wounded in hospitals both inside and outside Libya.  Two years ago  in this very Hall and on this very spot  Muammar Al-Qadhafi stood before the Assembly and tore up the Charter of the United Nations. That was a pathetic  theatrical move that disdainfully flouted international values. Even though we might have some reservations about the rules that govern the work of international organizations  they should not be judged in such a manner or treated in such a theatrical way  which is harmful to the people of Libya  to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  to the President of the General Assembly and indeed to the entire Organization.   I stand before the Assembly today to show the world that a new Libya is being born  a Libya that looks ahead with a vision of development and self-realization  a Libya that wants to heal its wounds  overcome its pain and reach out to the entire world. This new Libya wants to rebuild and to reform its history.  The vision of the new Libya is that of a civil  democratic State governed by a clear  unambiguous constitution that sets forth rights and obligations  that does not discriminate between male and female  one faction and another  one political belief and another  between east and west  nor along racial or ethnic lines.   All Libyans are the sons and daughters of this nation  a nation that is now determined to heal its wounds and move on after 42 years away from the international community. It seeks to be an active party  like other countries of the world  one that can contribute to a human civilization.  We do not claim to have a magic wand  as Muammar Al-Qadhafi did when he looked at himself in the mirror and suddenly discovered that he was an almighty prophet with a solution to every problem on Earth  except for Libya’s.  After 42 years  one fifth of Libya’s people live in poverty  and the country’s educational and health systems and services are the worst in the region. Infrastructure is falling to pieces  and youth unemployment is over 30 per cent. Those are the solutions bequeathed to us by Muammar Al-Qadhafi. Libya is witness to that.  The new Libya of which I speak did not arise from a vacuum. It has been watered by the blood shed since 17 February of this year  when Libyan youth decided to turn a new page in Libyan history. The entire Libyan people — young and old  women and children — paid the ultimate price. All the sons and daughters of Libya have written this page. No one can claim to lead this revolution or own it; only the Libyan people can claim that.  In the very first week of March of this year  a parallel action was launched alongside the act of revolutionary youth in all cities of Libya. A group of people  including myself  was working day and night to provide political support and to interpret the just cause of the Libyan people on Libyan soil  to interpret the prevailing oppression and dictatorship and the lack of any development for the past 42 years. Friendly  sisterly countries responded to that call. They reached out to the hands that had reached out to them. The world helped us to shed injustice.  On behalf of the Libyan people  I wish here to thank all friendly States  all sisterly States and all regional organizations. I wish to thank in particular the United Nations for Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011)  which were a determining factor in eliminating injustice and protecting civilians and preventing any further massacres in my country.  On the basis of such continuous diplomatic efforts  I can say today that that mission has been accomplished. Now we have a new mission. Let us make another attempt. Let us reach out to those who need technical assistance. Let all funds be unfrozen so that  having freed themselves from tyranny  the Libyan people can now rebuild.  Libya today is at the crossroads of realities on the ground  expectations and rightful dues. The facts can be summarized quite briefly. The land is not yet fully liberated. There are still some fronts to be liberated. It is our right within Libya to liberate our own land  and we hope to do just that sometime soon.  Our infrastructure has been destroyed. There are many wounded and martyred in all Libyan cities. More than 63 schools have been destroyed. There are more than 50 000 injured. Amputees number more than 1 700. They await help and succour so that they can    11-51360 48  once again effectively contribute to rebuilding their country.  The social fabric needs healing  having been torn by Al-Qadhafi. He tried to turn some tribes and communities against each other and some regions against others.   The economy is broken down. Oil sits  needing to pumped and exported. Although production is being resumed  we believe that more assistance is required in that regard.   Funds and assets have been frozen. The announced lifting of the freeze certainly does not rise to the level of what is required in order to enable reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country. State institutions need to be re-established and rebuilt  particularly because the country has been deprived of any real institutions for over 42 years. Libya is a State that had no law or institutions. Social and political demands are jostling each other  not just in terms of participation but also of setting priorities.   First and foremost  we must agree on the rules and principles of participation. In addition  as the Assembly knows  there are many expectations  from our people within and from members of the international community without. As the Assembly considers how soon the transitional period will begin and how the transitional Government will be created  it is calling for respect for human rights and for respect for foreign workers  asking that we deal with them in accordance with international norms. The Assembly calls for us to include everyone  without exclusion  to build institutions at the required speed  to achieve national reconciliation and end the arming and militarization of our streets and towns  and to maintain the unity of the homeland. The international community is also asking us to include it in reconstruction.   That is a great deal by any standard. Nevertheless  a people that was able to bring down its regime and face political initiatives from all sides could not accept that its situation was at a standstill. The Transitional National Council has always rejected compromise solutions. Through their will  the Libyan youth and Libyan people proved that those calculations were wrong  proving that they can win the battle and face all the challenges  despite all the doubts and problems that I just mentioned.  National unity without a unified land or without national reconciliation is an illusion. Achieving security and national reconciliation are urgent imperatives for any Government  whether interim or transitional. No political participation is possible without rules  rights and obligations. Therefore  it is of the utmost importance to put a draft constitution to the Libyan people for referendum. We want the rules of political participation to be fair and to govern the dialogue and competition  giving rights to all  without excluding any individual or group.   The assets freeze on our funds must be fully lifted as soon as possible. Let me appeal to the Assembly from this rostrum and to the Security Council to adopt the historic resolution to lift the freeze soon. The regime has fallen  even though we have not yet liberated the entire homeland.   We seek the help of the United Nations  the unconditional help of friendly and sisterly countries. We believe it to be a legitimate and undeniable right of all States to enjoy sovereignty  whatever the nature or size of assistance that is sought and needed.   The Libya that we want is a State of law  an oasis for human development in the Middle East. We believe that Libya  through geography  history and its geostrategic importance in the world  is a cultural link between North  South  East and West. Libya must resume that role  a role that has been denied to it for more than 40 years now.   I believe that development solutions that Libya may propose could help find unprecedented solutions to the phenomenon of illegal migration from the southern part of the African continent to Europe. We believe that the twenty-first century will be ruled to a large extent by demography  and we believe that Africa has the greatest capacities in terms of geography and human resources. We believe that hundreds of millions of young Africans will be driven by poverty and unemployment to move northward. Libya can be the gateway to development  instead of being the obstacle to migration from South to North.   African labour  skills and competencies that satisfy the needs of the European economies can contribute to European economic growth  particularly in the light of the fact that in the next 30 years Europe will be facing a much smaller  ageing population. In 2050  the population of Europe will have diminished by 72 million; Africa’s population will be nearly   49 11-51360  2 billion. We believe that all this can contribute to European economic well-being and development through an agreement between Libyan capital and European technology.  On the political front  Libya must be a civilian democratic State that gives full opportunities and participation to all its sons and daughters. Women must have a major role in the reconstruction of such a State. Women in Libya  about 50 per cent of the population  enjoy a very high level of education  because many continue their education beyond high school. We believe that women have a genuine role to play in rebuilding and developing Libya.   As for foreign policy  we need a vision that radically reviews Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s foreign policy  which was designed to sow fear  terrorism and blackmail in many regions of the world. Rare is the region of the world that escaped suffering from Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s practices and plots to destabilize them through terrorism. Our new foreign policy must be based on mutual respect and respect for mutual interests  and on non-intervention in the internal affairs of others  just as we do not accept that others intervene in our affairs. International instruments  conventions  treaties  norms  values and ethical principles must be respected. These are the terms of reference for all relationships today.  Rebuilding Libya into a civilian democratic State is an important matter  not only for Libya but  in our view  for the entire region as well. Libya is capable of becoming  and has the opportunity to become  a model of democracy and successful development. The negative effects of the separation of a country’s politics from its economy have brought many problems and difficulties to this region.  The time has come for a vision of development that puts young people and women at the very top of its list of priorities — not just because they make up 67 per cent of the population of the Arab world  but because the future belongs to them. It is they who started and led this revolution and the other revolutions of the Arab Spring. We therefore need a new vision that responds to the dreams of youth  a vision that the international community must support; otherwise  the region will only be subjected to successive waves of instability.  Supporting Libya in this development paradigm is no less important and critical than protecting innocent civilians. The international community  whom we thank  did this in implementing Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). In this context  we are proposing a clear initiative  which could be termed “building the new Libya”  to which our brothers and friends contribute. However  the United Nations must play a pioneering and leading role here  one through which its specialized development agencies can provide expertise and technical assistance. We must give those agencies precedence over private companies in order to avoid any possibility of corruption or lack of transparency and fairness. We believe that roads are made by the feet that walk on them. The Libyan people have now begun their march towards rewriting their history. We have great hopes in this international Organization  which has travelled hand in hand with us. It was a trustworthy  reliable friend — as was  indeed  the entire international community — and prevented an imminent massacre in my country by intervening at the right time to save civilians. That makes a reality of the Arab League’s call for an intervention  and we thank the League for that. Just as the United Nations was a faithful friend at that time  we believe it can now be a trusted and supportive partner in the rebuilding of my country. This is the major battle  for which we appeal to the Assembly for assistance — political  economic  financial and technical."
"100",4109,"LCA",66,2011,"Not since the prelude to the two world wars have there been so much uncertainty and anxiety within the international system. The sands are indeed shifting  as the President of the Assembly stressed at the opening of this sixty-sixth session (see A/66/PV.1).  The shifts in the struggles for freedom and the struggles for rights  some of which we in Saint Lucia take for granted; the shifts in the number of natural disasters that devastate country after country; financial meltdowns  increases in the price of energy and food  and food shortages have all converged and met at a moment when the challenge to cope weighs upon us all. However  the weight carried by a small island State bears down like an elephant on an ant  and although the ant is capable of carrying many times its own weight  it would never choose to carry an elephant.   The current world economic and financial situations are not of our making but they affect us more than anybody else. It continues to confound us how the States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  with the exception of Haiti of course — small island States like us  with limited resources  limited populations  limited land mass and small economies — can be classified as middle-income. With that classification  we are not eligible for special arrangements in finance and trade. There must be something wrong with that classification. We continue to argue that the methodology employed for such categorization puts small island developing States (SIDS) at a great disadvantage in terms of receiving favourable aid and trade packages  thereby adversely affecting our development strategies.  The continued attrition of trade preferences at the multilateral level challenges our very small — and  I reiterate  very vulnerable — economies and requires our Governments to employ creative structural arrangements and adjustments and fiscal exercises to keep our economies afloat. The present application of the terms of trade and conditions of aid are very unfavourable to us.  Emphasis therefore has to be placed on the consideration of a balanced approach to foreign investment and environmental integrity  and investors must not place undue pressure on small States. Rather  there should be an understanding of our challenges and our willingness to work in a win-win situation. Favourable mechanisms for finance and technology transfer would enable small island States to take advantage of the benefits that these offer as prerequisites for sustainable development. This is all we ask  nothing more — a chance to claim our part.  We stress our vulnerability to natural disasters and their disproportionate effect on small island economies  and we seek rapid and meaningful response mechanisms at the regional and international levels in order to enable our vulnerable economies to recover as quickly as possible. Almost every year  gains made during the first half of the year are eroded in the last quarter by weather-related phenomena.  Saint Lucia is still recovering from Hurricane Tomas  which struck the island in October 2010. Let me take this opportunity to thank those who contributed so generously to our recovery. Of course  we will still accept any generous contributions.  Saint Lucia  like other SIDS  recognizes the vital role that oceans play in national and global economic development. In light of this  the Government of Saint Lucia remains committed to ensuring the sustainable development of both coastal and marine resources.   For a number of years now  Saint Lucia has had legislation in place that speaks to effective fisheries management with laws on open and closed seasons for certain fisheries such as lobsters and  in order to prevent the capture of juvenile fish  mesh-size limits for nets and fish-trap fisheries. The Government is also targeting large pelagic fish and other species not traditionally harvested by local fishers  in order to reduce pressure on coastal and reef fishing. In addition  a number of marine reserves and marine management areas have been established  with the most well-known of these being the Soufriere Marine Management Association  which has been used to inform the establishment of other marine parks within the Caribbean and  I may add  globally. The Government of Saint Lucia has adopted an institutional framework for integrated coastal zone management and is working towards ensuring its successful implementation through a Caribbean coastal zone management unit and a coastal zone management advisory committee.    11-51687 8   I dwell on the issue of oceans and seas because the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise are real to SIDS  and Saint Lucia  through a number of projects and programmes  is seeking to build the island’s resilience to these impacts through the formal adoption of a national building code and the development of environmental impact  physical planning and development regulations.   Nevertheless  Saint Lucia has recognized the importance of having access to data and models at the national and local levels in defining and informing the country’s response to climate change  and in this regard is taking a number of steps to build the requisite database by working with various national  regional and global organizations.  The Caribbean Sea is an important international shipping route for both tourism and trade. Considered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to be a biodiversity hotspot  the Caribbean Sea is and will remain our livelihood. It keeps us afloat  but it can also drown us if we do not manage it properly; that is what seas do. It therefore needs special attention  and our Government is promoting an integrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea area in the context of sustainable development. We therefore support the work of the UNEP Caribbean Environment Programme  and we hope that funding will be made available to that programme to enable us to achieve our goals.  For all these reasons  Saint Lucia would like to call on the international community to ensure that there is a strong focus on oceans in the preparatory negotiations for the upcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We cannot forget the importance of oceans to SIDS in providing energy and food security  and to the world as a whole in regulating our climate. Oceans are a regulatory mechanism for climate.  As countries worldwide prepare for the Rio+20 Earth summit  we note that the green economy is a major theme for discussion. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are at the heart of the green economy. Petroleum giants like British Petroleum and Shell are now turning to investments in solar and wind energy. Countries such as Germany  the Netherlands and Brazil have positioned themselves as strong proponents of renewable energy. Sustainable energy technologies have been and continue to be a subject of significant research and development  with very promising results.   At the policy level  a number of countries  including my own  have articulated noble and ambitious energy policies to steer us into the future. In negotiations taking place pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  climate change mitigation is inextricably linked to sustainable energy development and continues to generate much debate as State parties seek to find lasting solutions to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.  But while the United Nations endeavours to promote equity and equality among individual countries  our capacities are not the same. Countries like ours yearn to enjoy the benefits of sustainable  renewable energy sources  but despite having significant potential for renewable energy  we have not yet been able to meaningfully develop these resources. It is therefore imperative that the international community take decisive action to assist small island States  isolated as we are  in achieving energy security through renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. Financing is a critical element in the development of new and renewable forms of energy.  So far  SIDS have largely been overlooked  as investments are made in larger economies where greater economies of scale and profits beckon. Even with the existence of avenues such as the clean development mechanism  which should also promote sustainable energy projects  the results have not been very encouraging for SIDS. We hope that  not too long from now  that situation may change.  We applaud the efforts and resources put into the conservation and preservation of the world’s forests to reverse desertification. We think  however  that considerable attention should also be given to what I term “small stands of trees” in our small island States. Although we call them forests  to those who have very large forests they are small stands of trees  but they are important to us because they are critical and crucial to soil fertility and therefore guarantee production and productivity in agriculture  thereby promoting food security and the alleviation of poverty.  Similarly  Saint Lucia welcomes the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing and is grateful to the Government of Japan for providing an implementation fund for developing   9 11-51687  countries. We see that as a great opportunity to help our communities to benefit from their biological resources and the traditional knowledge associated with them  so that they too can play their role in the conservation of biological diversity. In accordance with the declaration of 2011-2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity  we urge all countries to work closely together to conserve biological resources for the present day and posterity.  The recently concluded High-level Meeting on non-communicable Diseases provided an opportunity to deepen relations and collaboration with Member States  regional and international agencies and development partners  and to share technical expertise  best practices and resources as we continue to strive to meet clearly defined goals and objectives. As a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  which spearheaded this initiative  Saint Lucia wishes to place on record its appreciation for the commitment of all Member States  United Nations agencies  particularly the World Health Organization  and other interested groups in addressing the scourge of non-communicable diseases. We nevertheless need to set targets  implement programmes and measure success if we are to make progress beyond just another meeting.  Saint Lucia  like all of the other CARICOM member States  is grappling with security threats engendered by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and trafficking in narcotics. The associated rise in crime and violence involving the use of firearms has had a significant adverse effect on the socio-economic and human development of our countries. Saint Lucia will therefore spare no effort in working towards concluding an arms trade treaty that is legally binding  robust and comprehensive; contains the highest possible standard for the transfer of conventional arms  including small arms  light weapons and ammunition; is effective in regulating the arms trade  particularly in preventing diversion; and is universal in subscription.  Saint Lucia welcomes the Republic of South Sudan as the most recent member of our community and wishes it progress  peace and prosperity. We look forward to welcoming the State of Palestine to this body after successful negotiations have been concluded. That is our hope.  The anachronistic  half-century blockade imposed on the people of our neighbour  Cuba  suffocates that people’s right to prosperity and progress. The outdated mechanism’s illogical application does not fit twenty-first century geopolitics  economics or humanitarianism. We therefore add our voice to others that have spoken before us in calling for an end to this blockade and to all limitations on the rights of the Cuban people to progress and prosperity.  In the spirit of the greater good  we are pleased that  since 2009  Taiwan has been able to participate in the World Health Association (WHA)  in recognition of the fact that global health issues require universal participation and cooperation to overcome those major problems that affect the peoples of every corner of the globe.  Sustainable development  like health  is one of those issues that require global participation and cooperation. Taiwan is a leading economic and technological powerhouse and can contribute substantially not only to health but to a range of global issues that face the world today. We urge the United Nations to find suitable means to permit Taiwan to participate in its specialized agencies and mechanisms  including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change all of which have worldwide implications  along the lines of the WHA model. Surely  25 million people living on planet Earth can contribute to this body of peoples.  In conclusion  the shifting sands are revealing an international system on the brink of change. We are at a moment when a decision taken here in this great Assembly will reverberate throughout history. Decisions taken here can create a State or divide a State; they can bring peace or bring renewed conflict. The theme for this general debate — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” was well chosen. Let it guide our work this year and beyond. "
"101",4136,"LIE",66,2011,"It is a great honour to again address this Assembly  especially at the first general debate ever opened by a woman. What an inspiration! This debate has already proven that the General Assembly can indeed play a central role in multilateral diplomacy  in particular at this time of great change and turmoil.   I would like to express the solidarity of my country  Liechtenstein  with all of the peoples of the world that have  in recent months  sought to attain freedom from oppression and tyranny. We admire the courage of all of those women and men  young and old  who have stood up for their rights  often at great personal risk. We  the United Nations  must stand by them. I also wish to welcome South Sudan as the 193rd State Member of the Organization. The United Nations has yet again proven its ability to settle complex and violent conflicts by peaceful means. The developments in northern Africa and the Middle East may have roots mainly in the lack of connections between Governments and their people. While they may be primarily internal in nature  there is also an international dimension to the rapid changes we are witnessing. The events since February have put the Organization itself to the test  and more challenges can be expected to occur.   In recent years we have sharpened tools and concepts that are essential in helping us solve or prevent conflicts. So how did we apply them during these challenging times?   First  how well did we carry out our commitment to protect civilians? The United Nations has made much progress in developing the concept of the responsibility to protect. The concept has three pillars: in the first instance  the primary responsibility of the State concerned  and then the second pillar  according to which other States have a responsibility to assist in the protection of civilians. In two recent instances  however  the international community has had to act under the last and third pillar. We commend the Security Council for taking swift action to protect civilians in Libya and in Côte d’Ivoire. In both instances  the Council authorized the use of force only as a last resort  but also without undue delay.  Some have criticized the actions taken and argued that they were aimed at regime change. Let us not forget  however  that the regimes in question had a    11-51398 2  choice. It was they who chose to attack civilians. It was they who forced the international community to act. At the same time  we sympathize with those who perceived a selective application of the responsibility to protect. As the stalemate in the Security Council on Syria showed  politics continues  at times  to trump principle. In response  however  we need more principled action  not more politics.  Secondly  have we lived up to our promise to ensure accountability for the worst crimes? Have we lived up to the promise of “Never again!”  which we gave in the aftermath of Rwanda and Srebrenica? Once more  the international response to crimes committed in Libya has provided a glimmer of hope. The Security Council’s unanimous referral of the Libya situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC) was a historic decision. The ICC responded appropriately with swift action. Furthermore  the Court is also undertaking preliminary investigations regarding Côte d’Ivoire. The central role played by the Court in those situations and in many others has illustrated the profound paradigm shift brought about by the Rome Statute.   The core principle of that shift is now firmly entrenched in the fabric of international law: there must be accountability for genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. But accountability has not yet arrived everywhere that it is needed. Serious allegations of crimes committed in Sri Lanka and in Syria  for instance  have not yet found an appropriate and transparent justice mechanism. Again  the primary responsibility to ensure an end to impunity falls on the States concerned. International mechanisms  such as the ICC  can and must only become active where States fail to live up to their responsibilities.  Thirdly  how effective have we been in using mediation as a tool in the peaceful settlement of disputes? This topic  which was rightfully chosen as the central theme of the presidency  is at the very heart of the Organization’s mandate. We support the Secretary-General’s call to raise prevention from an abstract concept to a core operating principle. It is simply paradoxical that only a small fraction of the Secretariat’s resources is dedicated to mediation  while we spend $7 billion per year on peacekeeping.   In many situations  the good offices provided by neutral and trusted actors  such as envoys of the Secretary-General  can make a real difference on the ground. Such actions involve highly intense  often heroic efforts  which deserve much stronger support from us as Member States. Mediation efforts are increasingly influenced by accountability mechanisms. The General Assembly itself acknowledged this fact in its first ever resolution on strengthening mediation  where it emphasized  that “justice is a fundamental building block of sustainable peace” (resolution 65/283  thirteenth preambular paragraph).   In this new age of accountability  mediators can never offer amnesty from criminal prosecution or withdraw arrest warrants issued by the ICC. That is not only a matter of principle  but a matter of law. The ICC would never be bound by such promises. At times  the imperatives of peace and justice may compete with each other temporarily and make the mediator’s job more difficult. Over the long run  however  they are not only compatible  but mutually reinforcing. That message is sent around the globe upon each ratification of the Rome Statute. And we are particularly happy to note that the message has been sent 118 times so far  most recently by the Philippines and the Maldives.  Fourthly  have we done enough to include women in efforts at conflict prevention and resolution and to make them agents of change  instead of bystanders? Have we done enough to protect them during conflict  in particular  from sexual violence? We have collectively sent strong signals in this regard. Liechtenstein particularly supports the Security Council’s work on women  peace and security. We welcome the new focus on the role of women brought about by the creation of UN-Women. Women have been a driving force in the Arab Spring. But as some countries transition to a new era  women risk being left behind once again.   The United Nations is often involved in transitional processes. It must ensure a strong role for women and apply a gender perspective. Most important  the United Nations must lead by example and appoint more women as leaders in mediation and other transitional processes. It was therefore with great pleasure that I signed the joint statement on advancing women’s political participation  earlier today.  Regarding the protection of women and girls from sexual violence  we place high hopes in the new monitoring and reporting mechanism. Expert teams will help strengthen domestic accountability mechanisms. The greatest responsibility  however  lies with peacekeepers on the ground. They are mandated   3 11-51398  to go into harm’s way and protect civilians. They must fulfil that mandate even more effectively when faced with situations of sexual violence. Most important though  we must once and for all eradicate all instances of sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers themselves. It is not enough to simply repatriate Blue Helmet soldiers who have committed such crimes. Zero tolerance for sexual abuse must finally become a reality.  Fifthly  have we done enough to address the root causes of the unrest in many countries  including poverty  unemployment  corruption  lack of freedom and human rights? Those root causes and the strong popular opposition against them  remind us of a simple truth: economic and social development are inextricably linked with good governance  human rights and the rule of law.   The international community has many tools at its disposal to assist countries in reforming their systems of governance. We strongly support United Nations activities to promote the rule of law and combat corruption and make financial contributions to that end. There is no shortage of assistance and capacity-building programmes. What is needed is greater political will to actually make use of them. It is  however  the task of the United Nations to improve the manner in which rule-of-law assistance programmes are delivered and coordinated. We would welcome a stronger role for the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group in this regard  and hope that progress can be made at next year’s high-level meeting on the rule of law.  The events of recent months have shown us once again how irresistible the call for freedom can be. And they have shown us  once more  how indispensable the Organization is when it comes to assisting peoples that aspire to such freedom through democracy. Despite all the criticism  I am convinced that the United Nations has in recent years become more effective in delivering on its mandate. If we work together here  we will achieve results much more efficiently than through individual actions. Great opportunities lie ahead of us — let us accept the challenge."
"102",4183,"LKA",66,2011,"It is with great pleasure that I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency. I must also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon warmly on his reappointment as Secretary-General and we look forward to working with him constructively.   As we gather here today  it is appropriate to reflect on the values and ideals that inspire the United Nations system. One of the principal attributes is the spirit of flexibility  which has always been a feature of the United Nations. We must acknowledge the need for that spirit of openness and adaptability today more than at any other time. That is because the foundations of the world order are being transformed dramatically and fundamentally. At the heart of those changes is the need to protect the smaller countries in the developing world and to advance their interests vigorously.   In the midst of uncertainty there are some things that must remain constant. They reflect our most cherished beliefs and convictions. Despite repeated references in this Assembly by many member countries to the right of the Palestinian people to a State of their own within secure borders  we still have not been able to make it a reality. It is a cause of profound disappointment that this has not yet happened. There is a window of opportunity now and we must make use of it before it is too late. It is time for decisive action rather than more discussion. That will be in the interest of the security and well-being of the entire region  including Israel.  The need for sustained support for the countries of the African continent at this critical time is also worthy of mention. It is important to remind ourselves that every country cherishes the values  traditions and deeply held religious convictions it has nurtured over the centuries. They cannot be diluted or distorted under the guise of human rights by the imposition of attitudes or approaches that are characteristics of alien cultures. If that were to be done  it would amount to a violation of human rights in a fundamental sense. It must also be pointed out that  even where sanctions are imposed  extreme care has to be taken to ensure that the people at large  men  women and children yet to be born  are not harmed by such action. I would also express once again my solidarity with the people of Cuba and wish them all success.  While the clash of ideas  opinions and values continues  we have clearly to recognize that dialogue  deliberation and consensus offer the only viable means for resolving differences. The might of powerful nations cannot prevail against justice and fair play. In the troubled times in which we live we can derive guidance from the wise words of Gautama the Buddha  who advised the Lichchhavi Princes  whose energies were being consumed by bitter disputes among them    15 11-51185  that the way forward consisted of meeting  discussing and departing in an atmosphere of amity and goodwill. That represents the essential spirit of the United Nations and is particularly relevant today.   The most significant challenge to stability and progress in the modern world is posed by the menace of terrorism. Recent experience the world over amply demonstrates that inconsistent standards and discriminatory approaches can unintentionally give a fresh lease of life to the forces of terror. An explicit and uniform response that refuses to recognize political shades of terrorism is required.  Terrorism presents a threat from which not even the wealthiest and most powerful nations are immune. It must be remembered also that terrorist groups frequently operate under the guise of front organizations. Conferring legitimacy on such organizations has had the inevitable effect of providing comfort and encouragement to the merchants of terror. As the leader of a nation that has paid a heavy price because of terrorism over a quarter of a century  I underline that we must firmly resolve to rid the world of terrorism. We need to have solid  practical action on the ground and send out our collective message on this issue loud and clear and universally.  The interests of the developing world need to be protected in another significant respect. It is vitally important to insist that the structures and procedures of multilateral organizations should be uniform and consistent and devoid of discrimination. My country has reason for concern at approaches tainted by an unacceptable degree of selectivity  which we brought to the notice of such organizations in recent weeks. The developing world must keep a vigil against such irregular modalities  which should be resisted through our collective strength. Today  after three decades of pain and anguish  Sri Lankans of all ethnicities  living in all parts of Sri Lanka  are free from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam terror and no longer live in a state of fear. However  I am deeply mindful that the battle for peace is every bit as important and difficult as the struggle against terror. After the eradication of terrorism  my Government turned its undivided attention to building anew the foundations of a unified and vibrant nation  drawing upon the inherent strengths of our country and in particular the unique calibre of our human potential.  It is justifiable for us to be proud of our nation’s achievements during the brief span of the 30 months since the beginning of the post-conflict phase. The resettlement of more than 95 per cent of the internally displaced persons  who constituted the largest number of civilians forcibly held by a terrorist group at any time  while continuing even today to clear the mines laid by terrorists in extensive areas  is an achievement of which we can be proud. Today in the Northern Province our armed forces are engaged in the development of the infrastructure that was destroyed by the terrorists during a period of three decades. Contrary to malicious propaganda the numbers of armed forces personnel present in the Northern Province has been kept at a minimal level. Revival of the economy has enhanced incomes and improved livelihoods. Ex-combatants and other cadres  after exposure to programmes of vocational training and counselling  have been reintegrated into society. The electoral process has been restored after decades  making possible the emergence of a democratic leadership.  These are among our valued accomplishments. The remarkable growth of 22 per cent of the economy of the Northern Province is a clear indication of the success achieved by the Government’s initiatives with regard to development in that part of the country. The gross domestic product growth of the country has been consistent at 8 per cent  and unemployment is at a record low of 4.5 per cent. It is also worthy of mention that  in the assessment by the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report for 2011-2012  Sri Lanka shows dramatic improvement  moving up to fifty-second from their rank of seventy-ninth over a span of two years. It is worthy of note that all these developments have taken place within the brief space of 30 months — an achievement all the more significant because of our strong emphasis on reconciliation. Important as economic development is  we have attached the highest priority to fostering the spirit of inclusivity and removing any remnants of bitterness from the hearts and minds of all our people. Over the past 30 months we have recruited 669 Tamil police officers  bringing the total number of Tamil officers to 1 143  while plans are afoot to recruit more this year and in the future. After more than two decades a census is being conducted in the Northern Province as part of the national census  to provide a firm basis for our initiatives.     11-51185 16   As a result of these achievements  what we see in Sri Lanka today is a self-reliant nation with robust hopes for the future and a strong economy  strengthened by inward investment flows  unprecedented expansion of tourism  and significant growth in volume of international trade. With a view to consolidating these trends and leaving behind us the trauma of the past  we ask of the international community the hand of friendship and goodwill  based on an understanding of our nation’s determination to confront with courage the challenge of a new era in our history. We ask our friends in distant lands to drop preconceived notions. We strongly believe in home-grown solutions for them to be sustainable. It is clearly impractical to conceive of universal remedies for problems that afflict our societies. My country  as it comes out of the darkness of the past three decades into the light and promise of the future  must be afforded the time and space to seek its destiny in accordance with the wishes of its people. That is in keeping with the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the whole body of international law that governs us.  A further consideration that the international community should take into account is the vulnerability of developing nations  and it should make provision by means of appropriate institutional arrangements for their protection. As I observed when inaugurating the fiftieth anniversary meeting of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization in Colombo three months ago  the dumping of commercial and industrial goods manufactured in developed countries imperils the economies of many Asian and African countries represented here.  In conclusion  let me say that the use of substantial subsidies by treasuries and reserve banks to support agricultural production in the developed world  and other forms of protectionism  cause a serious distortion in the interplay of market forces and greatly reduce the ability of farmers in many developing countries to access international markets for their export products on an equitable basis. The disproportionate pollution of the environment by industrialized countries and the resultant impact on global warming and climate change cannot be remedied with any semblance of justice by imposing harsh restraints on developing countries  which have contributed very little to aggravate the problem. These circumstances heighten the importance of social equity at the international level.   May the Noble Triple Gem bless you all."
"103",4225,"LSO",66,2011,"At the very outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his well-deserved election to the office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of my delegation’s full support during his tenure. Let me also pay fitting tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the commendable manner in which he led the work of the General Assembly during the sixty-fifth session.   Mr. Ban Ki-moon also deserves our heart congratulations on his reappointment as Secretary-General. His unanimous re-election was a true reflection of the confidence that all Member States have in him.  I also wish to express my profound joy at witnessing the Republic of South Sudan join the ranks of the Members of the United Nations. We welcome this new Member and extend our hand in friendship.  This sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly once again provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the overall situation in the world. The world continues to experience numerous challenges. The target date for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals is fast approaching  yet the world continues to be overwhelmed by unending hurdles on the path towards their achievement.   Despite globalization  the least developed countries are yet to be fully integrated into global markets. Rapid environmental degradation  compounded by the effects of climate change  continues to adversely affect ecosystems  agriculture  water resources and energy supplies. HIV and AIDS have not relented in decimating whole nations. The promotion of the principles of democracy and good governance  the protection of fundamental human rights  and the abuse of power in international relations continue to present challenges.  As if this were not enough  terrorism continues to torment us. Along with the other challenges  this is a fight that we collectively must win. Terrorism is a    11-51360 2  transnational problem that cannot be left to one State alone to confront. All Member States must cooperate in addressing and eliminating this menace. The biggest challenge that we face in the post-Cold War era is to ensure that terrorists do not lay their hands on weapons of mass destruction.   In this regard  we reiterate our call for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons. We urge the nuclear weapon States to remain faithful to their commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We further call on those Member States that have not joined the NPT to do so without further delay. However  it would be illogical to ask non-nuclear States to shun the proliferation of nuclear weapons  while States that possess them continue to perfect new generations of such weapons and to threaten their use at the slightest opportunity.  Some States Members of this global Organization continue to experience either internal or external conflicts of significant proportions. The international community has not been consistent in its approach to the management of these conflicts. In some countries  the international community  acting through the Security Council  has been swift and decisive in intervening militarily. In other countries  the same international community has preferred mediation  and in yet still others it has turned a blind eye  at best leaving the mantle to some of its members to unilaterally threaten the imposition of sanctions.  It is against this background that we welcome the theme of our general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. Indeed  the relevance and appropriateness of this theme at the present juncture in international relations is beyond doubt. In addressing this theme  we start from the premise that the peaceful settlement of disputes through mediation lies at the heart of the work of the United Nations. However  the United Nations has not sufficiently used mediation as a tool for conflict resolution.   The United Nations is charged with the maintenance of international peace and order through the Security Council. Consequently  the Council is expected to take a leading role in the settlement of disputes through mediation. In so doing  the Council must adopt the multilateral approach. Such an approach is the only way to guarantee transparency  impartiality and ownership of the process by the general membership of the United Nations. Mediation must have as its priority the peaceful settlement of disputes  the reconciliation of the parties and the future sustainability of peace and stability. Peace that is imposed without consulting all parties to conflicts cannot be sustainable. Bias and abuse of military power to influence the outcome of mediation in conflicts will quickly erode the credibility of the United Nations as an honest mediator and will reinforce perceptions of ulterior motives.  The Kingdom of Lesotho is a strong believer in the principle of subsidiarity. It is common knowledge that the primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security reposes in the Security Council. However  cooperation and coordination between the Council and regional organizations  in terms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter  is key to resolving conflicts speedily. The United Nations must empower and support the efforts of regional structures and organizations  which in all cases have a comparative advantage in mediating.  However  the Security Council can better discharge this function only if it is more representative of the membership of the United Nations. A more representative Security Council will take into account all our aspirations  and its decisions will command legitimacy. Consequently  we continue to call for the early and comprehensive reform of the Security Council in order to make it more representative of the Member States. It is simply baffling  if not appalling  to see how this all-important issue of Security Council reform is being deliberately stymied.  The settlement of conflicts through mediation has been put to the test  and its successes are well recorded in the annals of history. The peaceful settlement through mediation of the conflict in the Republic of Kenya in 2007 is a typical example. It should be recalled that  in Kenya  a group of eminent persons from Africa worked together with the United Nations to broker a peaceful solution to the political stalemate that resulted from the disputed parliamentary and presidential elections of 2007. That solution resulted in the formation of an all-inclusive and stable Government.   Secondly  a specific subregional mediation by the Southern Africa Development Community yielded fruitful results in Zimbabwe  as did that of the African   3 11-51360  Union (AU) in Burundi. Furthermore  we witnessed a successfully mediated solution bring an end to Africa’s longest civil war in the Sudan.   The world rejoiced together with the people of South Sudan in July 2011 upon their attainment of independence as a sovereign nation. The remarkable mediation efforts of the African Union  with the support of the entire international community  helped in consolidating peace in South Sudan. Indeed  the mediation efforts are continuing in that sister country to ensure the maintenance of peace in the post-conflict period.  It is our humble but considered opinion that  where mediation has been given a chance  lives have been saved. The cost in resources  be they financial or human  has been minimal  and the destruction of infrastructure avoided. Above all  reconciliation between the warring factions has been realized.  Strangely  and despite having mediation at its disposal  the Security Council has at times preferred military intervention. I may also add that  at times  some members of the international community have unilaterally engaged in military interventions. Whenever military intervention has been preferred  it has not enjoyed the support of the general membership of the United Nations. Needless to say  the impact of military intervention in conflicts is catastrophic for innocent civilians  and it destroys infrastructure and the economies of countries.   In this regard  Libya may be used as a case study. The African Union developed a comprehensive road map that would have led to a peaceful settlement of the Libyan crisis by the Libyan people themselves. Sadly  we witnessed the deliberate marginalization of the AU in the resolution of that crisis. Military intervention was hastily adopted as an option  and the results of this kind of intervention are a matter of record for all to see  and indeed will be with us for a long time to come.  Nevertheless  the opportunity for all stakeholders to work together on consolidating peace in Libya has not eluded us. The African Union road map for peace remains as relevant today as it was at the beginning of the conflict. The United Nations and the African Union must work together to bring about the consolidation of peace  national reconciliation and the establishment of an all-inclusive Government in Libya. The United Nations  and not just a few countries with vested interests  should take the lead in the reconstruction of that country. This transparent and unbiased approach alone can ensure that there is no relapse into conflict in Libya.  We must employ all assets at our disposal so as to fully exploit mediation as a tool for conflict prevention and resolution. The good offices of the Secretary-General in conflict prevention and resolution are an instrument that may be very effective in mediating conflicts. Those offices must be strengthened and given the human and other resources necessary to undertake mediation early enough to prevent conflicts and to deal effectively with those that are ongoing. In that regard  we encourage the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General towards the realization of a free and independent Western Sahara.  By the same token  we are convinced that the solution to the settlement of the question of Palestine will be attained through genuine mediation. The stalemate in the negotiations is a source of grave concern to my country. We urge all the parties involved to resuscitate the negotiations between the State of Palestine and Israel without any further delay.   Similarly  we must explore the possibility of a mediated solution to the problem between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America. The international community has been unanimous in its call for the lifting of the economic and commercial embargo imposed upon Cuba  yet the problem persists. Indeed  Cuba  like all Member States  is entitled to freedom of international trade and navigation.  I conclude by pointing out that the crises we face today provide us with an opportunity for introspection and to chart the way forward. The obstacles that lie ahead of us are not insurmountable. We must build a more robust multilateral organization that is responsive to the modern-day needs of our peoples. A United Nations that is able to work with its partners  including regional and subregional organizations  and all of its Member States will surely achieve much success in all of its endeavours. With renewed political will and determination  let us commit ourselves to the principles of mediation  as enshrined in the United Nations Charter  and to the peaceful settlement of all disputes and conflicts."
"104",4251,"LTU",66,2011,"Twenty years ago  Lithuania rejoined the international community of sovereign States and became a Member of the United Nations. The unique experience of peaceful transition  State-building and reforms during the past 20 years has made Lithuania stronger and more determined. History has taught us that an honest broker at the national     11-50871 16  bilateral or multilateral level is the key to solving almost any problem.   In recent years  we have invested in building our capacity to become such a broker. Lithuania has just concluded its chairmanship of the Community of Democracies. Today  we are proud to chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I am also confident that Lithuania’s commitment to effective multilateralism and the fostering of dialogue and cooperation internationally makes it a deserving candidate for non-permanent membership of the Security Council. We are ready and determined to run for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the 2014-15 term.   Meanwhile  looking forward to Lithuania’s presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session next year  I would like to assure members that we will do our utmost to contribute effectively and wisely to the work and principles of the United Nations in all of its bodies.  Just a few months ago  women leaders from all parts of the world met in Vilnius to share their experiences in enhancing democracy worldwide. This event  organized by Lithuania as Chair of the Community of Democracies  confirmed my belief that the involvement of women in addressing common problems and concerns is still very low. Therefore  Lithuania strongly welcomed resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution  proposed by Finland and Turkey and adopted by the General Assembly. I am very pleased that that resolution advocates the enhanced role of women in peace mediation. The full involvement of women in conflict resolution  peace talks and decisions on post-conflict reconstruction is essential.   The same applies to the protection of women in conflict situations as defined in the historic Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions. I would like to announce that Lithuania has drawn up its first national action plan for implementing resolution 1325 (2000).  We live in an era of constant change. The maintenance and improvement of our ability to tackle traditional crises must be supplemented with an increased capacity of the United Nation to address such new threats and challenges as energy security  cybercrime  food safety and climate change  to mention only a few. I especially appreciate and would like to stress the importance of the Secretary-General’s strong engagement in nuclear safety and his call to build a stronger connection between nuclear safety and nuclear security.   In the light of the world’s energy needs today  nuclear energy can be an essential element of sustainable global development  provided it is used with necessary responsibility. I would like to draw the Assembly’s special attention to the word “responsibility”. Chernobyl and Fukushima are tragic examples  but they teach us very important lessons. It is not enough to rely only on recommendations  proposals and encouragement for cooperation when we deal with nuclear safety issues. I believe that our responsibility is to create strict legal international imperatives. We cannot allow any compromises on safety and security.  In this respect  the efforts of the United Nations  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  the European Union and other organizations to ensure nuclear safety throughout the world are critically needed today. Lithuania emphasizes the key role of the IAEA in this area. We welcome the ambitious nuclear safety action plan that was adopted by the IAEA General Conference in Vienna today.   Lithuania believes that strict adherence to uniform nuclear safety standards must be obligatory. Specialized Agency missions for the entire nuclear cycle  including site evaluation and follow-up missions  should also become an inseparable part of any nuclear power plant development. Each and every nuclear power plant  its site  nuclear technology and even the ability of the personnel to ensure safety maintenance should be subject to stress tests. Last but not least  information about all existing and planned nuclear projects must be absolutely transparent and open to public access.  We believe that the nuclear security summit in the Republic of Korea next year will provide an excellent platform for discussing nuclear safety and security issues for the whole world. With a view to that forthcoming summit  Lithuania is ready to contribute to the practical measures set forth in the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit Work Plan.  The prevention of any type of crisis — be it a military conflict  a nuclear accident or a terrorist attack — is a challenge for all of us. But it is also an   17 11-50871  opportunity: an opportunity to strengthen the United Nations leadership  an opportunity to intensify our joint work  an opportunity to promote dialogue and mediation  and even an opportunity to save resources that can then be devoted to research and development  protection of the environment and support for the most vulnerable. I invite us all to seize that opportunity for the sake of our common safety  security and prosperity  which is what we all wish for."
"105",4295,"LUX",66,2011,"Luxembourg is very pleased that the President of the European Council  Herman Van Rompuy  was able for the first time to address this Assembly on behalf of the European Union (see )  and I align myself fully with his statement.  Never before has the United Nations been so indispensable; never before have expectations of it been so great. We are going through a period of great turbulence; a period  as the Secretary-General has said  burdened by great difficulties  but also rich in opportunity for the progress of humankind. It is our duty to respond to the expectations placed on us by all those across the world who seek peace  security and dignity.  On 9 July 2011 a new State was born before the eyes of the entire world. In January  during their referendum on independence  the people of South Sudan spoke loudly and clearly. More than 98 per cent of the electorate voted for the independence to which the southern part of Africa’s largest country had aspired for so long. Luxembourg is proud to have recognized South Sudan on 9 July  even before the historic moment of its admission to the United Nations.  The independence of South Sudan is a testament to the willingness of the two parties in the long Sudanese conflict to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. It is now up to both parties to show the same willingness to implement new agreements to address the issues of good-neighbourly relations between the Sudan and South Sudan. The two Sudans  and their peoples first of all  will benefit if the relationship finally becomes a constructive one  allowing for socio-economic development on a new basis.   The international community stands ready to support both countries. The development of the Sudan and support of the new State of South Sudan on its path to viability  stability and prosperity are tasks that we must all tackle together and cooperatively. The European Union is actively engaged. Luxembourg fully supports its efforts and is also committed bilaterally  particularly regarding demining activities to help remove the vestiges of a war that was so long that it has marked several generations of Sudanese.  A few days ago  in recognizing the full powers of Libya’s National Transitional Council  the Assembly blessed  in a way  the end of Colonel Al-Qadhafi’s dictatorial regime  one that suffocated the whole of Libyan society for 42 years and did not hesitate to use    11-51378 2  heavy weapons against its own population without discrimination  trampling on its people’s aspirations for freedom.  The international community had to react  to assume its responsibility to protect Libyan men  women and children who were under fire — and who  unfortunately  are still under fire in Sirte and Bani Walid. We did not want to reproach ourselves yet again for having hesitated too long  for having neglected our responsibility to protect those unable to defend themselves against the cruelty of their own authorities. We did not want once again to be the powerless witnesses of large-scale violence.   Our Organization was able to react and demonstrate its capacity to act in a decisive  timely and just manner. The General Assembly suspended Libya from the Human Rights Council. Acting within the remit of Chapter VII of the Charter  the Security Council authorized all measures necessary to protect the population and civilian areas under threat of attack. The Council was able to act so decisively because the international community  and the region in particular  supported its action. The Arab League played a very important role in this regard  which I heartily commend.  Today  thanks to their courage and the resolute support of the international community  the Libyan people are free to choose their future. Together with our European Union partners  we stand ready to support Libya on its path to democracy and to help the National Transitional Council in its immense task of establishing a new State  in which human rights are respected and every element of society can find a place. As Mr. Jean Ping  who was President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session  put it so well in Paris on 1 September  Africa will benefit enormously from the emergence of a democratic Libya  at peace with itself and with its neighbours. We will all benefit from it.  In Tunisia and in Egypt  the people have also prevailed in their quests for liberty and the rewriting of the social contract  in the face of the supporters of their former regimes. In other countries in the region  people must  alas  continue to struggle to achieve respect for their fundamental freedoms.   In Syria  the regime continues to conduct a brutal campaign against its own population. Every appeal  including that of the Secretary-General  to end the violence and repression has so far remained unanswered. As the Human Rights Council on 23 August decided  commendably  to send urgently an independent international commission of inquiry to Syria  the Security Council should also assume its responsibility in the matter. The credibility of the United Nations as a moral force  one that protects civilian populations and their rights  is at stake. Equally at stake is the capacity of the United Nations to be present in crises  revolts and disasters that assault peoples’ dignity and threaten their very existence.  Peace  security  dignity — these are also key words when we talk about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the right of two peoples to live in peace  security and dignity.   A solution to this conflict  which has lasted too long and has poisoned the entire region  must necessarily be reached through the recognition of the right of both parties — not just one of them — to live in a sovereign and viable State. This is unfortunately not yet the case  despite the hope inspired by the courageous words of President Obama at this very rostrum last year (see A/65/PV.11). On the contrary  we have seen neither a halt to the illegal construction of settlements  nor a significant lifting of the embargo on the Gaza strip. The revival of direct peace talks was short-lived.  We all heard Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s vibrant appeal yesterday  his call for recognition of the his people’s legitimate right to a State and for acceptance of the aspirations of Palestine to have a seat in the Assembly and to fully assume its place among the nations of the world. I can only hope that his appeal will be heard. Israel’s legitimate desire to live for the long term in security depends on the realization of the right of the Palestinians to live in dignity in their sovereign State.  But merely responding to this appeal is not enough. It is imperative that negotiations between the two parties start again as soon as possible. Only negotiations will allow tackling the root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The parameters for a settlement have been known for a long time. I fully support the proposal made yesterday by the Quartet for a strict timetable: one month to agree on the agenda and modalities of the negotiations  and no more than a year to reach a comprehensive agreement.    3 11-51378   I appeal to the parties to show proof of their political will and ability to make the necessary compromises and sacrifices so that by the end of 2012 peace in the Middle East finally becomes a reality. From this rostrum  I reiterate firmly that the restart of negotiations cannot again stumble over cement and stones  and I dare believe that the Israeli Government knows that. In their efforts both now and in the future  the parties can count on the nations of the European Union  including my country  Luxembourg.  The events over the past year in North Africa  the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa remind us of the importance of a United Nations Organization with solid means for prevention and mediation  for peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Conflict prevention is one of the principal obligations set out in the Charter of the United Nations. Primary responsibility for that belongs to Member States  but no State can act alone. Each must be able to count on the support of the rest.   At the 2005 World Summit  we all committed to promoting a culture of prevention  and we put in place important new tools and mechanisms. The Peacebuilding Commission  by uniting all concerned actors and formulating integrated strategies  is an essential element of these.  My country is deeply convinced of the relevance of a broad and multidimensional approach to peacebuilding. Luxembourg is proud to be an active contributor to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission  notably as Chair of the country-specific configuration for Guinea established this February. Our priority is to support the authorities in Conakry in the areas of national reconciliation  security sector reform and employment for women and young people. Since 2010 Luxembourg  in its national capacity  has been supporting mediation conducted by the Community of Sant’Egidio between the main political and civil society actors in Guinea.  Both at the bilateral level and in its capacity as a member of the European Union  Luxembourg sees conflict prevention and providing support in post-conflict situations as being at the heart of its activity abroad  primarily through multilateral instruments  with the United Nations  naturally  first and foremost among them. The challenges we face are not limited to political conflicts but also concern economic  social and environmental transformation.   Let us remember that the Arab Spring began with an act of social protest. We therefore agree entirely with the priority that the President intends to give during his mandate to sustainable development  poverty eradication and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  With our European Union partners  we will do everything in our power to contribute ensuring that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  which will take place in Brazil less than a year from now  in June 2012  is truly successful. Rio+20 must set a range of ambitious goals that will ensure that we stay on track with sustainable development and preserve future generations’ ability to live on our planet.   Sustainable development  in its three elements — economic  social and environmental — has long been at the centre of Luxembourg’s development cooperation policy. I am happy to say that Luxembourg has managed to maintain and even increase its efforts in terms of official development assistance  which in 2010 reached 1.09 per cent of our gross national product.  We no longer need to prove the close link between security and development. For Luxembourg  the links between security and climate change are equally obvious. As the Secretary-General observed  climate change must be seen as a threat multiplier. Luxembourg’s commitment to combating climate change  including through the Group of Friends created here in New York for that purpose  is also part of our strategy for preventing conflicts before climate change makes them worse. In that context  my country offers support and technical assistance to small island developing States  particularly those in the Pacific  whose existence is threatened by climate change.  Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997  Luxembourg  together with its European partners  has made binding commitments to reduce its carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Luxembourg is also contributing to the fast start finance initiative in order to tackle climate change. I should stress that these resources are new and additional to our official development assistance.  Among the numerous other challenges that require a coordinated and collective response  I should like to mention one in particular: the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable    11-51378 4  diseases not only cost 36 million human lives every year; they also result in significant losses to national revenue and pull millions of people below the poverty line. They affect all of us and are having an increasingly preponderant impact on developing countries. The response to this challenge of epidemic proportions must be global and universal.  I therefore commend the initiative on the part of the Caribbean Community countries to put this subject on the General Assembly’s agenda and to publicize  beyond the medical community  the scope and impact of the crisis in non-communicable diseases  including in development terms. There is no question that the debate in the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases  the round tables and the various side events held in the last few days have allowed us to reach that goal. We should now fully implement the commitments undertaken in the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2  annex). I can assure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue its efforts to that end at the national  regional and international levels. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  whose tenth anniversary we have just commemorated  were attacks against not only the United States  the host country of our Organization  but against all of us  against our values and principles  our convictions and beliefs. Our Organization itself has become the target of cowardly attacks. Such despicable acts must not  however  lead us to turn inward. On the contrary  they should encourage us to redouble efforts to continue to act together in furthering the ideals and values of our Organization and its Charter  to fight together against terrorism and for a better and safer future for generations to come  for development and respect for human rights  for democracy and the rule of law. That is our joint responsibility: the responsibility to prevent  to preserve and to protect.  Luxembourg stands ready to shoulder its responsibilities and to continue to work for an effective multilateralism  including — if the Assembly affords us the opportunity — as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2013-2014."
"106",4321,"LVA",66,2011,"At the outset  I wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of the fullest cooperation of the Latvian delegation. I also congratulate the Secretary-General on his re-appointment to his honourable post for a second term. I wish him the greatest success and strength in guiding the Organization and the Secretariat in all their complex tasks.  I warmly welcome the State of South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations.  Latvia has always supported strengthening the United Nations as the only truly universal international organization. However  the United Nations must change and adapt to the new realities in order to deliver the best results and sustain its influence. The revitalization of the General Assembly and the reform of other principal organs are essential so that the United Nations can keep pace with the modern realities in the world and to make the whole of its work more effective. That will allow consistent adherence to the principles of sound budgetary discipline and a fair distribution of expenses among the Member States.   In the context of the global economic slowdown  we welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to cut the United Nations budget for 2012-2013 by 3 per cent  and we look forward to a constructive discussion on that matter.  The reform of the Security Council is long overdue. We call on all partners to work sincerely on this important issue. Latvia is ready to assume greater international responsibility and is planning to engage   25 11-50702  more actively in the Council’s work by putting forward its candidature for a non-permanent seat.  This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Latvia’s joining the United Nations  after regaining independence. In those 20 years we have undergone a complete transformation. From a Soviet-occupied European country with no trace on the political map  Latvia has re-emerged as a country with stable democratic institutions and membership in the United Nations  the European Union and NATO. From a closed  regulated system we have developed an open  liberal market economy. From a totalitarian regime we have grown into a democratic society where the rule of law and human rights are respected. Now we are able to share our transformation experience by helping other countries in their own development.  Important changes  often called the Arab Spring  have started in North Africa and the Middle East. People have gone to the streets demanding democratic reforms and influence on the future development of their countries. The international community has to support those aspirations and assist in building stable and trusted democratic institutions and establishing the rule of law.  We welcome the timely reaction of the United Nations to the events in Libya  such as the Security Council’s decision to provide humanitarian and security assistance and to refer the case to the International Criminal Court. Latvia has recognized the National Transitional Council of Libya and supported the General Assembly decision to allow the Council to represent Libya at this session. Joint action is crucial  and we hope that the United Nations  in collaboration with relevant regional actors  will continue to play a leading role in Libya.  We support the Security Council presidential statement regarding the events in Syria (S/PRST/2011/16) and the Human Rights Council decision to urgently dispatch a special mission to Syria (A/HRC/RES/S-16/1). The message is clear: violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians are totally unacceptable and strongly condemned by the international community. We look forward to an appropriate follow-up on this issue in the Security Council.  Today the international community has a historic responsibility to make the Middle East a safer  more prosperous and more democratic place to live. We must support the Middle East peace process with the goal of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. Latvia strongly encourages both sides to resume dialogue without delay. Sustainable peace is possible only if the Israelis and the Palestinians reach an agreement that takes into account the legitimate interests of both sides. The international community — the United Nations  the Quartet  the Arab League and others — should act together to help both sides to return to the negotiation table.  Turning to sustainable development  I would like to stress that we have a responsibility to future generations for the preservation of the natural environment in the world. That responsibility includes an obligation to ensure that the resources available to us now are used in the most appropriate ways.   In order to address the challenges posed by climate change  joint global action is needed with regard to emissions reduction and global warming. Later this year  the next United Nations Climate Change Conference  in Durban  will take important decisions. Any proposed agreement on climate change action should be a reasonable compromise that is acceptable for the majority of participating Parties and does not exclude any of the major economies.  In order to achieve sustainable development  protecting the environment and preserving a healthy society are most important. However  in the twenty-first century we face a new challenge: non-communicable diseases. We commend the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases and the adoption of the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2  annex). We hope that we will have an effective follow-up process.  The economic crisis has reminded us that we live in an interdependent world. We are deeply worried by the level of uncertainty and volatility in international trade and financial markets. The primary responsibility for prudent governance is at a national level. However  in the current situation the international community must once again act together and find sustainable stabilization measures in order to prevent another downturn in the global economy.  My country  Latvia  was one of those hit first and hard by the crisis but now is among the countries that are steadily recovering. Our gross domestic product is growing again and unemployment is falling. The recovery of the Latvian economy can teach us several    11-50702 26  simple lessons. First is the importance of acting quickly and decisively in adopting austerity measures. Secondly  in order to carry out structural reforms  there is a strong need to communicate and to engage with society. The third and final lesson  of course  is the value of international solidarity.  We face a large number of transnational threats  including terrorism. This year  we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. We express our solidarity and sympathy with the victims of 9/11 and others who have been affected by terrorism all over the world.  As we combat terrorism  we must also analyse its root causes. Our aim in Afghanistan is to help to stabilize the security situation and to build local democratic institutions. That will empower the Afghan Government to take over responsibility for security throughout the country by 2014. A sustainable solution in Afghanistan can be found only if regional actors  including the Central Asian countries  are part of the process. Joint action is needed to unlock economic opportunities  to strengthen regional security cooperation and to develop infrastructure and transport corridors in order to connect Afghanistan with the region and the rest of the world.  In addition to the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  the importance of regional organizations is increasing. In that context  we draw attention to the protracted conflicts in Europe in Transdniestria  Abkhazia  South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Regional organizations — in this case  the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe — must continue working to seek peaceful solutions. Good cooperation with the United Nations is crucial.  In that regard  let me emphasize the principled and consistent position of Latvia and the EU in supporting the peaceful settlement of conflicts and values such as democracy  the rule of law and the protection of human rights. Those lie at the core of the EU foreign policy strategy.  This year  we carried out the review process of the functioning of the main United Nations human rights body — the Human Rights Council. Latvia saw that review process as a unique opportunity to improve the performance and credibility of that important body. We took note of the outcome of the review process (resolution 65/281  annex). However  we believe that much more could have been done to enable the Council to live up to the expectations of countries and people.  Latvia believes that members of the Human Rights Council must lead by example through full commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. Latvia attaches the greatest importance to that commitment by putting forward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council elections in the year 2014.  Challenges to global security  development and human rights can be overcome only by our joint efforts. Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly."
"107",4368,"MAR",66,2011,"It is a great pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Al-Nasser my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His election reflects the esteem enjoyed by the brotherly State of Qatar and the Arab world as a whole. We are   45 11-51384  confident that his rich diplomatic experience will ensure a successful session. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his successful efforts throughout his presidency.   We also reiterate our congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. We highly value the initiatives undertaken during his first mandate  in particular the establishment of UN-Women. I also reiterate our strong support for the priorities set by the Secretary-General for his second term.   This session is taking place in a sensitive international context. The world is facing acute and complex crises  some of which are structural and persistent  including climate change and the food crisis  while others are circumstantial  such as the unprecedented financial crisis and devastating nuclear accidents. Yet others  too  have had profound impacts  such as the financial crisis that became a global economic crisis with destabilizing social and political consequences. A decade after the horrific events of 9/11  there is also the continued threat of international terrorism with its growing links to transnational organized crime in all its aspects. In addition  national and international tensions and armed conflict persist.  Such a critical situation has rarely been witnessed by the world. We are therefore called upon to reflect objectively on the following questions: What type of United Nations do we want in the face of these issues and challenges? How can we ensure that the United Nations will serve as an influential and efficient legal and political framework for the collective management of global affairs? How can we ensure the effectiveness of the Organization’s bodies and organs in adapting to the fast-changing world? And finally  how do we confirm the role of the Organization as the principal axis of a multilateral system based on solidarity and coordination with new international groupings of limited membership that are endowed with the ability to promptly respond to new events?   These questions are not based on an idealistic approach but emanate from our deep belief in the highly important and unique role of the United Nations as a framework and reference for efficient and just global governance  based on solidarity  and which draws its legitimacy from its global membership and the capital it has accumulated since its establishment.  To be effective  global governance must serve as the natural extension of national  regional and subregional governance. All Member States should shoulder their responsibilities in adopting appropriate measures and actions at the national level so as to lay the foundation for and consolidate good governance.  On that basis  the Kingdom of Morocco opted several decades ago to establish a democratic State based on good governance  guaranteed individual freedoms  the dignity of its citizens and respect for human rights  while upholding the principles of equality  equal opportunity and social justice  as well as the struggle against marginalization and social exclusion. The Kingdom  through the insightful vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI  has also based the establishment of a democratic and advanced society on two interdependent pillars: strengthened political reform and the realization of human development.  The recent adoption of the Kingdom’s new Constitution was an historic landmark in this distinctive process and highlighted the cohesion among all components of the Moroccan nation with its multiple branches. It consolidates the principles of the separation and balance of powers while preserving the full independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. It also defines the rights and duties of citizenship and lays the foundations for political and economic governance through regulatory  mediation  representation and accountability institutions. It also strengthens women’s participation in politics and social and economic development. In that context  broad regionalization enjoys a central role in the innovative constitutional architecture. It serves as the backbone of community democracy aimed at achieving development based on balance and solidarity among all regions of the Kingdom.  The Arab world is witnessing profound events and transformations that  on the one hand  highlight legitimate aspirations to freedom  dignity  progress and universal values that are shared by all regions  cultures and religions. Those events also show  on the other hand  that social and economic development cannot be achieved without political transparency and the evolution of democracy for the benefit of individuals and communities. There can be neither progress nor stability in the context of political stagnation  ideological closure  the erosion of legitimacy and the absence of any renewed or peaceful transfer of political power.    11-51384 46   Lastly  those events have also shown that each Arab country has the capacity to build a political system that reconciles universal values and national specificities  and that combines necessary openness and the preservation of cultural and civilizational identity. In that regard  Morocco welcomes the institutional progress made by Tunisia and Egypt and calls on the international community to support the efforts of those two brotherly peoples on the complex  promising and sensitive path of democratic transition.  Morocco also expresses welcomes the delegation of the National Transitional Council of the new Libya  which aspires to a better future based on transparency  reconciliation and consolidation of the rule of law. In light of the solidarity and brotherly links between the peoples of Morocco and Libya  Morocco has from the very beginning supported the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people and the actions of the National Transitional Council at the national and international levels.  Morocco is also confident that Libya will regain its natural international position within the Maghreb countries. Moreover  Morocco hopes to see concerted Arab action to prevent further bloodshed and guarantee peaceful resolution of the crises in brotherly Syria and Yemen through the announced profound  substantive reforms and based on territorial integrity and ensured stability.  Those aspirations and changes reflect the free will of the peoples and require the effective and serious support of their Arab brothers and partners  in full respect for their national specificities  while taking into account each country’s progress in the democratization process. In that context  Morocco highly appreciates the Group of Eight’s response through the Deauville partnership.   Morocco believes that  in addition to its financial support  that promising partnership will act as an incentive by encouraging the five Arab beneficiary countries to rely on their own capacities to enhance economic integration  on the one hand  and to share good experiences and best practices in the field of democratization and constitutional reforms  on the other. Morocco is willing to work with its brothers in this framework based on the progress it has made in political openness and its experience in the field of democratic transition and distinctive constitutional reform.   The events and challenges in the Arab world also highlight the need for renewed regional governance based on the effective integration of harmonious and coordinated groupings  such as the Maghreb Arab Union  the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agadir Agreement for the Establishment of a Free Trade Zone between the Arabic Mediterranean Nations. The latter could be enlarged to include other Arab and Mediterranean countries and could extend its activities to areas of democratic reform and political dialogue. This new governance seeks  under the aegis of the Arab League  to create a new regional Arab order with innovative mechanisms and renewed foundations  to serve human development  economic integration and democratic openness  and to prevent conflicts and the danger of separatism.  It is clear that a final settlement to the Palestinian issue is a necessary factor in accelerating the pace of the ongoing Arab endeavour in the interests of all peoples of the region. The question of Palestine is today at a historical turning point. It is characterized by the absence of any prospect of negotiation  the ongoing settlement programmes  and the Israeli policy of detention  annexation  destruction and displacement  particularly in Jerusalem  as well as collective punishment and the disproportionate use of force against civilians  as reported by the United Nations in the report on the freedom flotilla.  Due to the rejection by the Israeli Government of constructive international initiatives and proposals by the sponsors of the peace process  the situation has deteriorated  and prospects have faded for the relaunch of a serious and genuine negotiating process on the final settlement  in step with reciprocal commitments. It is time for the United Nations  through its various organs and using all available mechanisms  to shoulder its full responsibility by enabling the Palestinian people  under the leadership of its National Authority  to achieve all its legitimate national rights  in harmony with efforts to strengthen the foundation of an independent Palestinian State and taking into account the momentum of international support and recognition.   Morocco has always been the first to defend the choice of peace and the brotherly Palestinian people in its struggle  and today it cautions against the stalemate in the peace process  its underlying dangers and the prevalence of the logic of force. It reiterates its support for the request of the Palestinian Authority  in the   47 11-51384  person of President Mahmoud Abbas  for Palestine to become a full Member of the United Nations as a sovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital. Morocco  under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI  Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  will spare no effort in contributing to all constructive initiatives and supporting all actions towards the realization of that goal as soon as possible.   Moreover  our collective goal should be the revival of the peace process on the basis of clear terms of reference  a comprehensive agenda  a precise time frame  an innovative negotiating methodology  and the effective and strong involvement of the Quartet. In that regard  the Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the positive signals in the recent statement made by the Quartet.   Consistent with its vision of solidarity and integration in the Arab region  Morocco is engaged in broad consultations with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council with a view to establishing an advanced and substantive partnership in various strategic  political  economic  social  human and security fields. Morocco  which has strong ties with all members of that important regional group  wishes to establish a new model of concrete and distinctive partnership that would contribute broadly to sustainable development  stability and the containment of the threats to the security  territorial integrity and high interests of our countries. In that context  Morocco reiterates its support for the legitimate rights of the United Arab Emirates with regard to its three occupied islands.  Morocco’s Maghreb  Arab  Islamic  Mediterranean and African dimensions  as well as its commitment to strengthening South-South cooperation  as enshrined in its new Constitution  contribute to the diversity of the issues on which Moroccan foreign policy is based  consistent with its aspirations to establish regional governance founded on consultation  dialogue and solidarity. Recent reforms undertaken in the Maghreb countries could give new impetus to Maghreb integration  consistent with the aspirations of the five peoples of the region and their efforts to achieve development and stability.  In that context  Morocco has worked relentlessly to activate bilateral relations with brotherly Algeria through ministerial visits  which it hopes will pave the way towards a comprehensive normalization between the two countries  including the reopening of land borders in accordance with the principle of constructive good-neighbourliness.   Inspired by the same will  Morocco reiterates its full commitment to pursuing and intensifying the negotiations to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara  on the basis of the Moroccan autonomy initiative that the Security Council  through six successive resolutions  has deemed to be serious and credible. This bold and realistic initiative takes into consideration  within the framework of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity and sovereignty  standards of international legitimacy that go beyond unilateral restrictive interpretations that can only aggravate the status quo and lead to deadlock.  Security Council resolution 1979 (2011) renewed the emphasis on the fundamental guidelines of the negotiating process by calling for all parties to enter into substantive and serious negotiations and to show realism and a spirit of compromise to reach a midway solution  while urging neighbouring countries to fully engage in the process of negotiations. It is high time for each party to shoulder its responsibilities  particularly in the light of the events taking place in the region  with a view to working seriously and in good faith to reach a final political compromise solution to this fabricated regional dispute. There is also an urgent need to meet the aspirations of our brothers in the camps in Tindouf  Algeria  where they are denied their most basic human rights and any hope for the future.  From this rostrum  I reiterate the persistent need to achieve effective Maghreb integration in the context of the Arab Maghreb Union as an open  complementary and democratic framework to serve the interests of the peoples of the five countries — the Greater Maghreb. Such integration should contribute in an effective and innovative manner to the present dynamic in the Arab world. The Arab Maghreb should actively contribute to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation  in particular in the context of the Union for the Mediterranean  and to development and stability in the Sahelo-Saharan region. It should be in the position to overcome terrorist threats and the related dangers of transnational organized criminal networks.    11-51384 48   King Mohammed VI made Africa the top priority of Moroccan foreign policy in October  promoting cooperation and solidarity in order to meet political  social  economic and security challenges hampering comprehensive development in the continent. With the same commitment  Morocco has contributed positively to international and regional efforts to settle several conflicts  including through its early and ongoing participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. In Africa  in particular  Morocco has actively supported transitional democratic processes in Guinea  Côte d’Ivoire and Niger  among others.   Convinced of the need to develop and strengthen a common coordination and negotiation mechanism among African countries  Morocco has worked in cooperation with its African brothers to launch the Ministerial Conference of African Atlantic States with the aim of optimizing cooperation opportunities under that common mechanism to overcome common challenges  in particular those related to security and environment.  There is no doubt that achieving the goal of sustainable development in developing countries  particularly in Africa  remains a daunting challenge  given the persistent gap between international development assistance and the heavy debt burden of developing nations. In that context  we support the small and island countries of the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific and Indian Oceans in their efforts under the Mauritius Strategy.   With that clear vision and constructive approaches reflecting the balance between domestic and foreign policy priorities  the Kingdom of Morocco calls on the States members of the General Assembly to support its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the biennium 2012-2013  in accordance with the rotation principle of the African Group. That bid reflects Morocco’s aspirations to serve peace and stability  strengthen solidarity and uphold universal ideals. Above all  it serves the goal of maintaining international peace and security as a clear constitutional commitment of the Kingdom. It enshrines our more than 50 years of pioneering experience  during which more than 50 000 Moroccan peacekeepers have served in United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide.   In that context  Morocco is participating actively in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission  which is an effective instrument to promote international solidarity with countries emerging from conflict and those starting a peacebuilding and national reconciliation process. In that spirit and to strengthen its partners for peace  Morocco is deeply and transparently committed to implementing its international obligations on disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Its candidacy will support enhanced solidarity among developing countries through South-South cooperation and the creation of mechanisms based on a new vision that will include humanitarian assistance to confront natural disasters and the food crisis  particularly in sub-Saharan African countries  as well as the Caribbean and Pacific island States. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to the economic and social sectors  including agriculture  health care  water and electricity. We currently host more than 9 000 students from 42 countries  among whom 8 000 have been granted Moroccan scholarships.  Finally  Morocco’s candidacy represents the promotion of universal values. Thanks to its diversity and openness  the Kingdom of Morocco has always served as a crossroads of civilizations — a land of peace  tolerance and coexistence among cultures and religions. Moreover  given its true commitment to the universal values of human rights  the Kingdom has taken several initiatives aimed at strengthening the culture of human rights. It also played a an important part in establishing the Human Rights Council review mechanisms  given its leading role in that United Nations body.   We are truly confident that the support of the members of the Assembly for the Moroccan candidacy  which represents a specific regional context  will provide the Kingdom  during its mandate in the Security Council  with the distinct opportunity to address  in a constructive and balanced manner  the sensitive matters on the Council’s agenda involving Arab and African issues.

"108",4392,"MCO",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly and to assure him of the support of my delegation throughout the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.   The Secretary-General  whom I heartily congratulate on his unanimous reappointment  introduced  at the opening of the general debate  the priorities that he intends to implement during his second term in office. His vision  which will guide our endeavours and our deliberations during this period of instability and uncertainty  sets forth the parameters for a new form of global governance that will need to  on the one hand  respond to the challenges that we face and to the aspirations of our peoples and  on the other  take into consideration the new realities of our time.  Among these new imperatives of the twenty-first century  sustainable development and the building of a safer world require a more responsible approach on the part of all our Governments and the renewal of our unwavering support for the Organization  whose crucial role in the prevention of conflicts  human rights violations and natural disasters needs to be strengthened and supported.  It was Mr. Al-Nasser’s clear-sighted initiative to make the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means the theme of the general debate. Our community now has a new Member — the Republic of South Sudan — following a peace process that was welcomed by all. Since the beginning of the year  we have seen a great impetus towards freedom and democracy among thousands of women and men across the Arab world. The Arab Spring has highlighted once again the universal nature of the norms and values of the Organization. Justice  democracy  human dignity  equality and freedom have led to renewed hope among peoples for too long repressed. Today we face a great challenge: not to disappoint them.  The Government of the Principality reiterates its support for and its solidarity with all who fight for respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law  and in that regard is hopeful that a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement will enable the State of Israel and a viable  sovereign and democratic Palestinian State to live side by side in peace and security.  The past year has been rich in challenges for our Organization. We have had to face great natural and humanitarian disasters  emergency situations caused by people and the fallout of the economic crisis. Each time we turn to this Organization to safeguard humanity’s shared assets  such as the environment  health and peace.     11-51390 12   We also turn to the United Nations to protect our collective security. The deadly attack a few weeks ago on the United Nations offices in Abuja  the capital of Nigeria  cruelly reminded us of the innumerable risks faced by United Nations personnel across the world — in Côte d’Ivoire  Afghanistan  Iraq  Darfur  the Sudan  everywhere where the United Nations has saved lives or upheld rights. They sometimes pay the ultimate price.   But our Organization has limited resources and cannot always deal with the multiplication of conflicts. We must therefore focus above all on the prevention of conflicts. What is a better prevention measure than development? Last year from this same rostrum His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco reiterated the Principality’s commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see A/65/PV.4). Monaco seeks to be a responsible  reliable and supportive partner  and its priorities continue to be improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable people.  I wish to underscore the essential role of women in the prevention and settlement of conflicts and in peacebuilding. Women and girls must be at the centre of our development strategies. It is now an established fact that a society that guarantees equality between women and men and promotes the economic independence of women is a more prosperous society. If we wish women to be able to realize their potential in the economic sector  we need to get rid of obstacles such as discriminatory regulations. We need to ensure that women have equal access to economic resources  particularly to land  credit  science and technology  vocational training  information  communication and markets.   In this regard  the Principality of Monaco wishes to reiterate its support for UN-Women and its Executive Director  Ms. Michelle Bachelet.  It is our shared responsibility to show our commitment in the crucial gathering of 2012 — the twentieth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit — and to create a solid basis for the comprehensive development of a green economy.   We are seeking to develop sources of renewable energy  more environmentally friendly and healthy. But in the short term  we are not in a position to abandon nuclear energy or oil. As we have learned so painfully through the Fukushima accident  we do not know whether one day it will be possible to fully control all the risks involved in nuclear energy. We thus continue to burn hydrocarbons  sending their emissions into the atmosphere. These pitfalls pose a great danger to our collective security.   It is time to put an end to the ideological debates and the divides that separate us and that delay our efforts to implement a green economy.  The Secretary-General proposed that we establish a new generation of development objectives to succeed the MDGs after 2015. The Principality of Monaco supports that initiative  which aims to encourage the international community to set ambitious goals and to provide the wherewithal to achieve them.   As part of its contribution to that endeavour  Prince Albert II wanted Monaco to contribute actively to the preparatory work for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development by organizing in the Principality  from 28 to 30 November 2011  a meeting of high-level experts on the sustainable management of oceans. His Serene Highness would like to see the international community place the seas and oceans at the top of the political agenda at the forthcoming Earth Summit.   In spite of the development of a legal framework to govern activities in the oceans  the negative impacts of human activities on oceans and seas are becoming increasingly visible. Marine pollution and unsustainable practices in the exploitation of marine resources are continuing to endanger marine ecosystems  to the detriment of future generations. Climate change has had a significant impact on oceans  leading to the phenomena of acidification  rising sea levels and coral bleaching. Sustainable management of the oceans is an essential pillar of the green economy.  Stronger prevention measures  at the service of all Member States  both developed and developing  will enable the Organization to carry out its role with greater efficiency and flexibility. That requires the strengthening of its institutions  taking greater account of the role of the General Assembly  balanced reform of the Security Council  increasing cooperation with regional organizations  enhanced interaction with civil society and private sector partnerships.   I wish to hail the leadership and political courage of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  who   13 11-51390  endeavoured to impose the moral force of the United Nations before the eyes of the entire world.   The Principality of Monaco will not fail to work for the improvement of global governance that our community hopes and prays for. We share the conviction regarding the immense importance of the universal values upheld and defended by the Organization  values to which future Members must adhere  as we have done. "
"109",4417,"MDA",66,2011,"It is a great honour and privilege to take part in the general debate and to represent my country on this rostrum at a significant juncture in Moldova’s modern history  the recent celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its independence and 20 years of its membership in the United Nations  which we will mark in a few months. These interrelated and complementary events constitute an excellent opportunity to once again express our genuine attachment to the founding principles of the Organization  and our sincere appreciation for the support and assistance the international community has given my country during this time.  On behalf of my delegation  I have the pleasure to extend congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on assuming his high and responsible position  and to join previous speakers in expressing our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss for his excellent management and the competence he displayed during his presidency of the Assembly. I would also like to reiterate our sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second term as Secretary-General  to convey our deep appreciation for his strenuous efforts and activity on behalf of the international community and to wish him success in continuing his noble mission.  The beginning of a new decade of the twenty-first century has been marked by major changes  sincere aspirations and high hopes in many parts of our planet. We wholeheartedly welcome the Republic of South Sudan’s declaration of independence and its entry into the United Nations as the 193rd Member State. We have witnessed the genuine desire of young people for democratic reforms and human rights  fundamental freedoms and social justice. Peoples in the Mediterranean region and in North Africa and the Middle East have set out firmly along the road of democracy  launching the Arab Spring. In that regard  we recall the events that changed Moldova and launched our country on a new  more democratic track in 2009.  In this time of change and historical upheaval  we note the transition of Libya to a new phase in its   25 11-51681  political development  as stated expressively in the Assembly last week by the Chairman of the National Transitional Council Executive Office of Libya (see )  whom the Republic of Moldova  like many other delegations  supported as Libya’s representative in the General Assembly. The role of the United Nations in supporting Libya’s transition to democracy in the wake of the downfall of the former regime has been incremental. We express our satisfaction at the Security Council’s approval of the creation of a mission to assist the transitional authorities and the Libyan people during the critical post-conflict phase.  We have also learned that natural calamities hit nations indiscriminately. In order to overcome the consequences of ecological disasters  such as the great east Japan earthquake  the Fukushima nuclear accident  the great flooding in Pakistan and the severe drought and hunger in the Horn of Africa  requires the common efforts of both developed and developing States. The international community has the great task of strengthening its humanitarian and disaster response capabilities.  Faced by different challenges  it is commendable to have a joint platform of concerted actions  managed by the United Nations. Poverty  conflicts  climate change  economic and financial issues  migration  pandemics  terrorism  international crime and other crises affecting humankind cannot be countered individually  but only by means of global strategies. The United Nations is a unique tool in addressing and overcoming them.  The United Nations should consolidate its central role in world affairs  and  consequently  enhance its multilateral and universal potential by making the Organization stronger and more representative  efficient and able to promptly react to major challenges. A reformed Organization must pragmatically adapt to new realities and strengthen its influence  in strict accordance with the United Nations Charter. The most appropriate methods of communication  consultation and cooperation during the reform process should be developed  in close interaction with other actors  such as the private sector  civil society and academics  who play a more visible role in shaping the modern world.  The greatest incentive for economic growth and security is a balanced and equitable global trade system  for which the international community has been struggling in complex negotiations since the Doha Round in 2001. While talks on the issue continue  discrepancies and ruptures in our economies make it difficult to stand against the waves of the economic and financial crises. It is hardly possible that countries  especially developing ones  remain immune to the globalized economic downturn. While we are required to implement drastic austerity measures  access to markets is vital for our economies. That is one of my country’s priorities. Our Government is working hard towards the extension and diversification of market outlets in cooperation with its partners  primarily in Europe. We rely on openness  a constructive approach and fair play in market relations as our best allies for win-win solutions in global trade.  The Republic of Moldova stands committed to its human rights agenda. Last year  my country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  in a sustained effort to contribute to the development and implementation of international standards in the fields of human rights and the rule of law.  As a member of the Human Rights Council  Moldova has taken an active part in the Council’s deliberations and activities  with the aim of building up a strong and legitimate human rights body. This year  Member States underwent the complex process of the Council’s review. Although not all the concerns of Member States were accommodated for a far-reaching and more ambitious outcome of the review  we should remain committed to fulfilling the balanced and objective agenda of the Council  while its membership is expected to comply with resolution 60/251 to uphold the highest standards in the field of human rights and to fully cooperate with the Council’s mechanisms.  The Republic of Moldova remains committed to that principle. In approximately two weeks  my country will engage in an intensive review by the United Nations Human Rights Council under the universal periodic review mechanism  involving not only the Government but also civil society and other national stakeholders. We intend to proceed in that exercise with genuine openness  objectivity and a constructive approach.  The commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks in New York on 11 September 2001    11-51681 26  reminded us once again of the great losses  the needed vigilance and the imperative to multiply our efforts in combating the terrible scourge of terrorism.  As a State party to all the universal legal instruments on the prevention of terrorist acts  the Republic of Moldova condemns terrorism and extremism in all their aspects  and welcomes the achievements of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We advocate the earliest conclusion of the negotiations of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism  the convening of a United Nations conference and the strengthening of all efforts on combating terrorism at the national  regional and global levels. To contribute to that end  the Republic of Moldova is currently hosting a regional event on preventing and countering the financing of terrorism in South-East European States.  Let me now refer to one of the most important security issues faced by the Republic of Moldova — the Transnistrian conflict. From the outset  I would like to reconfirm that the Government of the Republic of Moldova remains fully committed to the goal of achieving a political  comprehensive and viable solution to the issue  which should lead to the reintegration of my country.  During the past five years  in referring to the Transnistrian issue  we have always made the same appeal. Moldova calls for the unconditional resumption of the negotiations on the political settlement of the conflict in the “5+2” format. I am happy to announce that  exactly five days ago  at the 5+2 consultations round in Moscow  that decision was finally taken. We express our gratitude to the Russian Federation  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  Ukraine  the European Union and the United States — the members of the 5+2 negotiations format — for their efforts in reaching that result. However  the resumption of the official negotiations was never seen as a goal in itself. We are fully aware that the most difficult part of resolving the conflict is still ahead.  On this occasion  I would like to reiterate some basic elements of the Moldovan approach towards the problem. A viable and comprehensive political solution can be based only on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova  within its internationally recognized borders. The central question on the agenda of the five plus two negotiations should be the special status of the Transnistrian region within Moldova. On the one hand  that special status should ensure full respect of the needs  rights and freedoms of the local population. On the other hand  it should provide for the functional integration of the region with the rest of the country.  Over the past year  our efforts have been focused on mobilizing internal resources and international support to advance the conflict resolution process. In that regard  we continue to promote confidence-building measures between both banks of the Nistru River. Our current list of priorities includes the restoration of fully-fledged rail communications throughout the Transnistrian region  in accordance with international standards. Another important objective is the restoration of landline phone connections to allow people from the Transnistrian region to communicate freely with their relatives and friends in the rest of Moldova.   The main beneficiaries of such measures are  obviously  the population and the business community. The solutions are on the table. Our message for the leadership in Tiraspol is clear — abandon the policy of self-isolation and let us think together about practical and transparent solutions that would make people’s lives much easier.  Let me also refer to some unresolved issues that need further attention. We are concerned about the situation of Latin-script schools in the Transnistrian region  which remain under constant pressure from local authorities. Children should never become hostages of political disagreements. In the same context  we emphasize the need to improve the human rights situation in the region  in particular to resolve the case of Mr. Ilie Cazac  who has been abusively imprisoned in Tiraspol  in order to secure his immediate and unconditional release.  We need to reflect on the future of the existing peacekeeping arrangements in Moldova. I would like to underline the fact that Moldova has been at peace for the past 19 years. Therefore  what we really need is a peace consolidation  not peacekeeping  exercise. That requires the transformation of the existing  old-fashioned military mechanism into a multinational civilian mission operating under a relevant international mandate and focusing on confidence-building activities.  We should not avoid discussions about the presence of foreign military forces that are stationed on   27 11-51681  Moldovan soil without the consent of the host country  in breach of the Moldovan Constitution and relevant international commitments. We are confident that an early completion of the withdrawal of foreign munitions stocks and the armed forces guarding them from the territory of the Republic of Moldova will positively influence the process of settling the Transnistrian problem.  As in the case of other conflicts  the Transnistrian settlement process cannot advance to its final goal without wide international support  particularly from the mediators and observers. It is our strong belief that genuine mediation based on shared objectives  joint efforts and good faith is an essential factor in that regard.  We fully concur with the President’s focus on the peaceful settlement of disputes  and his assessment that peaceful settlements  including those brokered through mediation efforts  provide the most cost-effective and long-lasting solutions. We will actively engage in further debate on the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes  with a view to developing and consolidating the role of the General Assembly as the world’s leading peacemaker.  Moldova’s advancement on the path to European integration  the primary goal of which is the overall modernization of the country  remains the absolute priority of the domestic and external policies of the Republic of Moldova. The Government has initiated a series of deep reforms to ensure the rule of law  the independence of justice and a functional market economy where businesses and foreign investments can find a proper place to grow. Those have proven to be complex  lengthy and sometimes painful processes  but they are absolutely indispensable for further development.  Moldova’s proactive attitude and determination in promoting and implementing reforms has ensured a more intense and expanded political dialogue between the European Union (EU) and Moldova. We have made significant progress in negotiating an association agreement with the European Union by opening a structured dialogue on human rights and fully engaging in efforts to meet the conditions established during the visa liberalization dialogue. We are ready to launch negotiations on creating a broad and comprehensive free trade area with the European Union.  The European perspective continues to be the EU’s most effective tool in promoting dynamic and consistent reforms in neighbouring countries. We are confident that the promotion of democratic values  prosperity  stability and security in Europe will lay the foundation for the future EU agenda. That projection of soft power will be possible only if it is accompanied by an extension of EU borders. In that context  we hope that the Warsaw Eastern Partnership Summit will make an important contribution to strengthening EU relations with partner countries  developing its messages and leaving the door open for those Eastern European neighbours that are able to meet the accession criteria in the foreseeable future.  Over the past 20 years  my country has achieved significant positive developments in the field of internal affairs. Still  much remains to be done in the process of carrying out democratic and socio-economic reforms  the main objective of which is to consolidate the Republic of Moldova as a sovereign  independent and reintegrated European State.  In that regard  we further count on the support of the United Nations and its Member states in advancing the political and economic development of my country  resolving the Transnistrian conflict  speeding up the withdrawal of foreign military forces and implementing our development priorities.  In conclusion  I would like to reconfirm the commitment of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals and goals of the United Nations  and its readiness to further cooperate broadly by engaging in concrete actions to bring those ideas and aspirations to life."
"110",4460,"MDG",66,2011,"After three years of political crisis and a three-year absence  Madagascar is proud today to resume its place here in the community of nations. On behalf of my fellow countrymen  I am particularly honoured to participate in this general debate under the theme “The role of mediation in the settlements of disputes by peaceful means”.  The successive crises around the world  most recently in North Africa  demonstrate the importance and relevance of that theme. Madagascar has been through one itself  and it has just taken a major step forward thanks to the help of international mediation  which has allowed the Malagasy to reach a promising consensus.   I also wish to pay a sincere tribute to the late Dag Hammarskjöld  the former Secretary-General of this great Organization  a pioneer of preventive diplomacy and an architect of the concept of peacekeeping  as we mark the fiftieth anniversary of his tragic passing. During his tenure  he worked tirelessly to solidify the legitimacy of the United Nations in the peaceful resolution of international disputes. Now again  we owe him a great debt for the universal recognition of the virtues of mediation in resolving tensions and even conflicts.  We have just commemorated the tragic events of 11 September 2001  which shook the city of New York and indeed the whole world. It is also 10 years since the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations  during which the dialogue of cultures and the culture of dialogue were promoted on the international stage in order to combat the clash of civilizations.  When we speak of conflicts  we have in mind two different ideologies that do not uphold the same values. That can mean two countries  two regions or even a Government and its people. In the last case  when one no longer respects the other it triggers a popular uprising that ends in a conflict  leading to a crisis; hence  the importance of the role of mediation in settling disputes through peaceful means.    11-51191 32   In that regard  any mediation should collate first-hand information. It should see for itself the realities prevailing on the ground in a conflict before proposing a solution that would be lasting and acceptable to all.  History has shown that the excessive acts of a leader who resorts to force have serious repercussions for his country that can lead it into chaos and cost the lives of dozens  hundreds  or even thousands of innocent people. It is an entire people who  unfortunately  suffer the grave consequences. This occurs because true solutions are often too slow in coming  plunging a large segment of humankind into poverty  since we must respond to suffering  anguish and despair. We want to change and we will change.  To better illustrate my words  allow me to speak of the case of my country  Madagascar. Everyone here knows as well as I do that the island of Madagascar has been in political crisis since late 2008. The Malagasy people rose up with determination to break with a past marked by poor governance and non-respect for democratic principles  human rights and the rule of law that gave rise to widespread impoverishment  unbearable and inescapable social poverty  and the growing frustration of the majority of my countrymen. The Malagasy people therefore demanded a better life and genuine change  with strengthened respect for universal principles.  When the search for a solution to the crisis turned to the principle of consensual and inclusive management of transition  and when that consensus proved difficult to reach  commendable mediation efforts among the Malagasy protagonists were made by local civil society organizations  the bilateral and regional partners of the big island  and the international community.  I permit myself to mention here and to strongly commend the untiring and patient efforts of the mediation team of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  a regional body mandated by the African Union  as well as the determined initiatives of other entities  such as the United Nations  the International Organization of la Francophonie and the Indian Ocean Commission. The involvement of these and all actors concerned in the mediation was critical in responding with effectiveness and pragmatism commensurate with the emergency and in meeting the vital needs of the Malagasy people and economy  which could and would have been weakened if the crisis and the negotiations had lasted any longer.  The Malagasy people were patient and showed unprecedented and exemplary courage in the peaceful settlement of the political crisis  despite all the economic and social restrictions  as well as the absence of international aid that it has suffered for the past three years. The post-crisis road map for Madagascar  proposed by SADC mediation  was initialled on 9 March and signed by the political factions representing the vast majority of Malagasy stakeholders on 17 September. The great political Malagasy family is now determined to move forward and to work together in the overall interest of the nation for the well-being  peace and serenity of the entire people.  An extremely important threshold has just been crossed  but there is still much work to be done. Now  we must focus primarily on the implementation of the provisions of the road map  with full respect for the people’s primary aspirations  leading towards the holding of free  credible  fair and transparent elections. That  in my opinion  is the only definitive solution to the crisis ensuring a return to constitutional normality.   We have finally managed to reach a consensus agreement  reflected in the sense of compromise of which we are particularly proud  based as it is in the inherent culture of Fihavanana — a notion of social life that has guided the Malagasy people since the dawn of time and that can be boiled down to the principles of fraternity  solidarity  mutual respect  tolerance and wisdom. We have thereby expressed our resolve to move forward towards the reconstruction and development of our society.  For my part  I will spare no effort and will do my utmost to ensure that these actions achieve the anticipated results and are rapidly crowned with success. I therefore launch a solemn appeal to the international community to make the needed individual and collective contribution to their implementation. In particular  I draw the attention of the United Nations to the work that it must undertake in assessing Madagascar’s electoral needs so that an electoral timeframe  drawn up in a credible  neutral  transparent and independent way and based on respect for fundamental rights and international standards  can be established as soon as possible.  History teaches us that  even following the use of force  all wars and conflicts always end around a table. That clearly shows that mediation can be chosen as an alternative to weapons. We are opposed to the use of any form of repression whatsoever. It is entirely   33 11-51191  possible to resolve differences by peaceful means  as in the case for Madagascar  by resorting to a more effective method  such as dialogue.  The world is evolving. The world is changing  and all of us leaders here want a better world for our respective peoples. Yes  it is possible  and we can do it. "
"111",4500,"MDV",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset  Mr. President  to join previous speakers in congratulating you warmly on your assumption of office to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Your election is testimony to the growing confidence of the international community in the ability and commitment of the smaller Members of this Organization to play an increasingly active and responsible role in the United Nations. I would also like to take this opportunity to place on record our deep and abiding appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the sixty-fifth session.  Allow me also to convey my sincere felicitations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his re-election for a second term. We remain confident that his experience and leadership will ensure that this Organization  in which so many of our hopes and dreams are invested  will be equal to the many complex challenges facing us during these tumultuous times.  We are at a defining moment in history. Across the Middle East and North Africa  popular pro-democracy uprisings are sweeping away longstanding dictatorships. We are witnessing the greatest liberation movement since the fall of the Berlin Wall. But what is most striking is that it is happening in countries with predominantly Muslim populations. The democratic uprisings across the Middle East prove that Muslims yearn for democratic rights just as much as non-Muslims.   For me  that is not surprising. After all  we are all human. We all feel resentment if those in power steal our county’s wealth. We all feel frustrated if we are prevented from speaking our minds.   In the fog and confusion of the turmoil we are witnessing in the Middle East  one thing stands abundantly clear. The demand for human rights and democratic values is universal. The march of democracy is inevitable. And the argument that says Islam and democracy cannot be united is shown to be foolish and patronizing.   My country  the Maldives  in some ways was a harbinger of the Arab awakening. Our revolution began eight years ago. Then  in 2008  presidential elections brought peaceful closure to a 30-year authoritarian regime. Since then  we have had our difficulties consolidating democracy. There are many hurdles to overcome.  But I am pleased to report that in the three years since the elections Maldives is generally stable  safe and successful. I do not want to sound complacent. Democracy is a process  not an end goal. Freedoms are always threatened in one way or the other. A successful democracy requires more than just the separation of powers. We also need free media  strong institutions and a vibrant civil society. Above all  we need patience to realize the fruits that democracy brings.  Nevertheless  I can report without exaggeration that Maldives enjoys more freedoms today than at any other point in our history. I am sure that  with the support of the United Nations  the peoples of Tunisia  Egypt  Libya and other countries will also enjoy democratic freedoms.  We must counter the false perception that people must choose between devotion to Islam on the one hand  and the full enjoyment of human rights on the other. We strongly believe in the compatibility of Islam and human rights and seek to do our part to promote understanding and tolerance. That is why we intend to organize  during 2012  a major international conference on progressive Islamic jurisprudence and human rights. With this conference  we hope to renew the concepts of peace and tolerance  coexistence and inter-faith harmony in Islam.  As we watch the changes in the Middle East and North Africa  it has become even more imperative that the question of Palestine be addressed. The Maldives stands shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian people. The time for Palestine to join the international family of nations is long overdue. We therefore welcome its application for statehood. The Maldives calls on all Members to support the recognition of a Palestinian State  living side by side and at peace with the State of Israel. While recognizing the rights of the Palestinians  we also value and support the right of the people of Israel to live in peace and security.  We are proud to announce that last week Maldives acceded to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Maldives believes that human rights must be protected at the national and international levels alike. We are pleased to join a growing alliance of States that stand firmly against    11-51384 6  those who believe they can violate human rights with impunity. In our globalized world  those who trample human rights or deny basic freedoms will be held accountable. I am proud that the Maldives has now taken its rightful place as a defender of international law and human rights.  As a small island State  we understand that our means are modest. Nevertheless  we are proud to contribute to United Nations efforts to promote peace and security. In this regard  we are pleased to note that following the approval of our Parliament  the Maldives is looking forward to becoming engaged for the first time in United Nations peacekeeping efforts around the world.  As a newly graduated least developed country (LDC)  we welcome the international support we have received in our transition. Our graduation from LDC to middle-income status has not been easy. Based on our experience  I would like to say that the international community must continue to help States make a smooth transition from LDC status. We must not allow graduation from LDC status  and the removal of support that comes with it  to undermine a country’s progress and development.  The Maldives has spared no effort in highlighting the growing threats posed by climate change. Our nation is just one and a half metres above sea level. For us  climate change is no vague or abstract menace  but a clear and present danger to our very existence as a nation-State. Over the past year  the world has experienced an increase in natural and man-made disasters  which compels us to address the effects of climate change with more resolutely and urgently. It is becoming increasingly evident that the international community needs to be better prepared and equipped to address the challenges of disaster preparedness and response.  Cutting global carbon dioxide emissions to a safer level — below 350 parts per million — is not just an environmental issue. It is also an issue of national security. We view the cutting of carbon emissions not as a burden but rather as an opportunity — an opportunity not just to protect the climate  but also to create new jobs and grow our economies. For these reasons  Maldives is proud to announce that we will dedicate a minimum of 2 per cent of our total Government revenue to investments in renewable energy.   We look forward to the day when the international community will adopt a legally binding climate treaty. We welcome the incorporation of the political pledges contained in the Copenhagen Accord into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process in Cancún. In Durban  we look forward to helping to advance the process so that we can reach the elusive prize of an agreement that protects the climate and the interests of vulnerable nation-States.  From the very beginning  the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS) has been inextricably linked to the Rio process. Unfortunately  the objectives defined in the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy have  like the goals expressed in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development  gone largely unmet.  Now  as we set the goals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  we must include in the agenda a serious review of the progress made by the international community in addressing the sustainable development challenges facing small island developing States. The Maldives hopes that Rio 2012 will provide a platform and create the necessary impetus to radically reform international support for SIDS. This should pave the way for establishing a SIDS category based on objective  transparent and consistent criteria.   We must also analyse and identify the particular challenges and needs of SIDS  which are different from those of other developing countries. We must further ensure that United Nations programmes are redesigned to assist with those particular challenges. Maldives believes that three issues should form some of the key pillars to be discussed and acted upon in Rio next year. They are  first  the reform of United Nations support for the sustainable development of SIDS  secondly  a political declaration and strategy to give impetus to the roll-out and mobilization of renewable energy and green technologies  and lastly  improvements in the integration of sustainable development principles into international and domestic policy at strategic and project levels alike.  We are deeply concerned by the dire food crisis in the Horn of Africa. As the United Nations  we must come together to find global solutions to these challenges and ensure that we work to protect the   7 11-51384  rights of those who are most vulnerable  especially women and children.   As a country that derives its livelihood from the ocean  we are also concerned by the growing threat of piracy in the Indian Ocean. We will continue to work with the international community in addressing this growing menace so as to make our maritime areas safe for international shipping and trade.  The Maldives looks forward to a time when every country will be democratic  every nation will be free and the values that underpin this great institution can finally be realized everywhere. Through the institutions of the United Nations  we look forward to continuing to promote equity  fairness and the protection of the most vulnerable  regardless of where they live or what religion they practise.  Only through the United Nations can we hope to forge an agreement that protects our climate — a prerequisite for all of our future progress and development. In this volatile and ever-changing world  there is one institution that provides the stability of continuity  and that is the United Nations. The United Nations is more important today than ever before."
"112",4547,"MEX",66,2011,"It is an honour for me to participate in this session of the General Assembly. We have heard extremely significant speeches  which have  deservedly  captured   17 11-50692  the attention of the Assembly. However  as I speak in this lofty forum of the international community  I would like to lay out Mexico’s views  a country that  as one of the founding States of the United Nations  has actively contributed to ensuring that the Organization once again plays its role in promoting peace  justice  security  equity and sustainable development among nations.   The world faces major challenges  about which we have spoken today. We have talked about terrorism  war  peace  climate change and poverty. We know that we are afflicted by other problems  such as the global economic crisis. I would like to refer to just a few of them now  as I am aware that our duty is to strengthen the United Nations  to make it less bureaucratic and to once again turn this into an Organization that is able to tackle the pressing challenges of our time. Faced with this reality  Mexico is shouldering its international responsibilities firmly and with determination.  I would now like to refer to the problem that I think today most afflicts the poorest people in the world. More than 1 billion people  on every continent  are living on less than $1.25 a day. This is the problem of poverty. Over the past five years  the price of food has risen by more than 50 per cent. Over the past 12 months  the average increase has been 26 per cent. This means that the poorest families  who allocate most of their income to food  have sunk even deeper into poverty.   This is why poverty has increased around the world. This is why we once again see famine in the Horn of Africa  in various nations on that continent  in Asia and in Latin America. This is why  in addition to the democratic awakening of certain nations  we have seen many people suffering from hunger who have taken to the streets. Hunger is what has  in many cases  awakened their awareness of democracy.   Why the hike in food prices? That is the first question we must ask ourselves. It is partly because developing countries have grown rapidly  and that is a good thing. China  India and many others have reached growth rates that allow their people to have greater access to food. What is left to do is to develop the necessary technology to increase our capacity to produce food.  Secondly  drought and climate change have been other contributing factors. We have not truly realized that climate change is a serious threat to humankind as a whole. In particular  climate change is behind the drought that has restricted food production in recent years.   Thirdly  there is financial speculation and speculation on the financial markets. Let me point to one bit of data. In 1987  financial agents and companies bought just 7 per cent of food on the world markets. Today  more than 30 per cent of sales of corn and wheat in the world are made by financial companies. Why do they want corn and wheat? Is it to trade them on various markets or to distribute them to certain regions? Of course not. Trade companies and distributors buy 70 per cent of wheat and corn  but the remaining 30 per cent is bought by financial firms with one specific purpose in mind  namely  speculation. We see how they buy and sell the rights to food with the sole intent of driving up market prices  when thousands of children are dying of hunger across the various continents.   I am someone who believes in markets  economic freedom and enterprise. But I also know that the time has come for restrictions to be imposed on unbridled markets  which are also behind world hunger.  The second challenge that I would like to refer to is drug trafficking and international organized crime. Everyone is surprised by the dozens  hundreds and even thousands of deaths caused by repressive authoritarian regimes  and of course  we also repudiate these. However  we also have to be aware that organized crime today is killing more people — and more young people — than all of the current dictatorial regimes put together. Today  thousands of people — tens of thousands of people in Latin America  in particular between Mexico and the Andes — are dying because of criminals. I greet with affection and respect my colleagues from Central and Latin America who are here today.  Today  the world faces the challenge of unscrupulous criminals who have no respect for borders and who do grave harm to the citizens of many nations. The power of crime is stronger than many Governments  although assuredly not ours. This stems from two fundamental factors  namely  the exorbitant profits that flow from drug trafficking and unlimited access to the purchase of powerful weapons.   With respect to weapons  why do criminals have unrestricted access to AK-47s  R-15s and grenade launchers? In my view  having fiercely fought    11-50692 18  criminals and having seized 120 000 weapons in five years  the answer can be summed up in a single word  profits — the runaway profits of an arms industry that sees in every war  whether a civil war in some distant country or a battle among criminals  an opportunity to sell ever more weapons.   It is urgent for us to put in place serious controls in countries that produce and sell high-power weaponry  so as to prevent them from filling the arsenals of organized crime. The United Nations has its work cut out for it in that regard. The United Nations must continue to promote the draft international arms trade treaty and to prevent weapons from being diverted towards activities that are banned by international law.  Moreover  organized crime feeds off the astronomical profits produced by the illegal sale of drugs around the world. Unfortunately  the demand for drugs in those markets continues to increase. We must recognize that so long as there are drug consumers prepared to pay tens of billions of dollars to maintain their addictions or preferences  that market will remain the primary financial support for criminal activity.   Mexico is doing its part to energetically fight crime in all its manifestations. Today more than ever  however  drug-consuming countries must undertake effective efforts to radically reduce demand. It may be argued that this is impossible and that the demand for drugs is continuing to rise  as is the case here in the United States  where nearly 30 per cent of young people use drugs  and in other parts of the world.  What is the solution? I can honestly say that even if those countries are unable or unwilling to reduce their demand for drugs  or if they are resigned to the fact that it will continue to rise  they still have a moral obligation to reduce the huge profits that drug traffickers obtain from that black market.  It would be best to reduce demand  but failing that  reduce profits. Drug-consuming nations have the obligation to find a way to cut that source of endless economic gain  and to seek every possible solution  including alternative markets that would prevent drug trafficking from being the source of violence and death  especially in Latin America and the Caribbean and various African countries.  The third challenge to which I would like to refer is climate change. Along with Mexico  my Central American and Caribbean colleagues are experiencing ever more violent hurricanes that destroy the homes of the poor and cut short many lives. Ironically  just a few weeks ago  one of those tropical hurricanes that was headed for our Caribbean coast landed instead on the streets of Manhattan. There are still some who are surprised that there are hurricanes in New York  unprecedented droughts in Texas and never before seen floods in Pakistan or Mexico or Colombia or Guatemala. Even with all this  they still do not accept the fact of global warming.   I can proudly state that we have made progress and that Mexico has done its part in moving towards a solution to this problem. We organized the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  in Cancún  where important agreements were reached. For example  for the first time  nations agreed within the framework of a binding United Nations instrument to establish a global limit on the rise in temperature of our planet — of no more than 2° centigrade by the end of this century.   We also agreed to establish the Green Fund  to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts.   In addition  we created a mechanism for technology transfer that incorporates methods for reducing emissions caused by deforestation and soil degradation  which will allow the poorest countries to contribute to reducing global warming by preserving their forests and jungles. In Mexico  more than 12 million people in indigenous communities  who make their living from jungles and forests and who have had no choice but to destroy them  today use their woodlands in a sustainable way and are paid by the rest of society for the environmental service that their trees provide.  With the approach of the seventeenth Conference of the Parties  in Durban  we fear that without sufficient political leadership and commitment to its own Convention by the United Nations  we may lose part of what we have achieved in the battle against climate change. We must advance within the Kyoto Protocol  keeping in mind that the provisions of annex 1 expire next year. What will happen with our environmental obligations in the light of the failure of the most relevant nations to take action?   19 11-50692   The best way to fight climate change is to break with the false argument that we must choose between economic growth and combating climate change. They are in fact perfectly compatible. Through actions that build sustainable development  we can simultaneously reduce poverty and climate change.  Finally  another challenge is the social basis for reducing poverty and marginalization. In Mexico we established a programme for transferring money to the poorest of our population  with incentives for mothers who take their children to school or health clinics. The programme offers an average of $80 monthly to the bottom fourth of Mexico’s poorest families  benefiting more than 30 million people and reducing extreme poverty in our country by nearly 50 per cent between 1995 and 2010.   Recently  we have focused on guaranteeing the health of all Mexicans. In five years  we have added 2 000 new hospitals and clinics  reconstructed 2 000 more and introduced a national health policy that already covers more than 100 000 people. This allows Mexico to proudly state today in the United Nations that this year we will achieve universal health insurance  covering doctors  medicines  treatment and hospitalization for any Mexican who needs them. That achievement  of which we are proud  confirms the fact that Mexico has already achieved almost all the Millennium Development Goals to which it committed itself.  Finally  I should now like to discuss a crucial issue that has to do with the transformation and modernization of the United Nations. The conflict in the Middle East is a matter that has clearly tested the capacity of the Organization. We are particularly concerned about the stalemate in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. The United Nations bears the responsibility for making a constructive contribution to the peaceful resolution of this conflict — one that makes possible the existence of two States  reaffirms the recognition of Israel’s right to exist and makes the establishment of a Palestinian State a reality. Of course  we must bear in mind that this must be a genuine  viable and negotiated solution in which legitimate and balanced mediation plays a fundamental role. Such a solution must also be politically and economically viable and enable Israel and Palestine to truly exist side by side in peace  so that new generations of Israelis and Palestinians can truly know what it is to live together without hatred or violence.  We should also remember that no solution can be found while either of the sides  explicitly or implicitly  desires the annihilation of the other. In addition  we must make progress on compliance with United Nations resolutions in order to put an end to policies that we all know are contrary to international law.  It is also vital that we move forward together in transforming and modernizing the Organization. It is an excellent thing that the United Nations building is being renovated; now we need to modernize the Organization at its core. It must not fail in its commitment to history and humankind. It is time that all Member States play our parts in ensuring that the Organization has the strength and viability that it needs  and that it lacks. There have been many occasions  for instance  when the United Nations has been paralysed by the tyranny of consensus  where a minority is able to defeat a large majority. Consensus must no longer be seen as the veto power of the obstinate; rather it should be understood as the possibility of building shared and genuinely legitimate solutions that reflect the will of the majority.  Keeping the United Nations relevant also necessarily implies the reform of the Security Council  whose rules of participation have not been revised in more than 40 years. Mexico seeks a total reform that improves representation for all Council members while at the same time preserving the Council’s capacity to take action and promoting its members’ accountability. We cannot allow the chief supranational body to become a decision-making centre for the few.   Mexico reaffirms its confidence in the United Nations as a forum that represents the diversity and plurality of human beings. Mexico also reiterates that it will continue to be a strategic ally of the Organization in the struggle for peace  the war against hunger and the struggle for security and the progress of all peoples of the world.

"113",4572,"MHL",66,2011,"On behalf of President Jurelang Zedkaia  I bring warm greetings from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the General Assembly. The Marshall Islands also welcomes South Sudan as the newest Member of the Organization.  The Marshall Islands congratulates the Secretary-General for making nuclear disarmament and nuclear safety a top priority at the United Nations during his second term. Fifty-seven years ago  at the dawn of the Cold War  the United Nations held the Marshallese people in trust. Marshallese leaders petitioned the United Nations to put a halt to the testing of nuclear weapons. The United Nations responded with Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV)  adopted in 1954  and 1493 (XVII)  adopted in 1956. Acting with assurances of our protection  the United Nations and its administering authority  the United States  detonated 67 large-scale nuclear explosions in the Marshall Islands. For decades  Marshallese leaders have returned to the United Nations to speak of the continuing impacts — cancer  fear and continued exile from our homeland — and of a science where goalposts are always moving.  Three weeks ago  the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum  in their communiqué  not only recognized the special responsibility of the United States of America but also agreed to support the Marshall Islands at the United Nations  including in addressing the issue of the Secretary-General’s report. The United Nations has a clear responsibility to acknowledge and address the consequences of nuclear testing undertaken under its watch — and a special responsibility has already been acknowledged by the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Last year  the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report on the effects of atomic radiation in the Marshall Islands. Such a report would represent the potential for the Marshall Islands  the United States and the United Nations to take a very positive step forward towards understanding our past  bringing closure to this sad chapter in our history and beginning to understand how the international community can assist us in addressing future remediation challenges. The involvement of the United Nations is key.  Sadly  I am concerned that the Secretary-General has thus far neglected this critical opportunity. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation  which was invited to contribute to the Secretary-General’s efforts to assemble a report  has termed the General Assembly’s deliberate mandate to be “not appropriate” and “an apparent error” in need of formal correction (A/66/46  para. 13).  That is not only insensitive but it reveals that perhaps the United Nations itself has yet to come to terms with  or even to merely acknowledge  its decisions on nuclear safety taken 60 years ago. That negative approach could preclude efforts to bring to the attention of this body important scientific work that has been done in assessing the consequences of the nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands.  It is our hope that United Nations will have the courage and will to rise above the past and make a difference  rather than allow itself to remain controlled by history  and make excuses. As I said earlier  for decades  Marshallese leaders have returned to the United Nations to repeatedly speak of the legacy of the nuclear testing in our country. It is my hope that one day a new generation of Marshallese leaders will come to this forum not to speak of this sad legacy  but rather to proclaim that the work is done and that all is well.  The impacts of nuclear testing are not the only historical legacy from international actors in the Marshall Islands. Unexploded ordnance from the Second World War and oil leakage are persistent issues for our outer island communities. They pose threats to our human security  public health and environmental safety. We welcome the attention of Pacific Island Forum leaders  and we join the call for assistance from international bodies and development partners.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands is not just a small island State; we are a large ocean nation.    11-51398 14  Together  the oceanscape of the Pacific islands is an area that covers 10 per cent of the world’s surface and is four times the size of Europe. The way we manage our maritime space is therefore a central pillar in our basic development aspirations  and has significant implications for the health of global oceans.  International commitments to ensure sustainable fisheries and to visibly advance our development aspirations can no longer be paid mere lip service and then later be ignored by our partners in regional processes  including the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. The Marshall Islands presently only sees a penny of benefit for every dollar of the market value of our Pacific tuna. The conservation measures by the parties to the Nauru Agreement  including the Vessel Day Scheme and high seas closures  must be implemented by our partners  not only to reduce pressure on overfished stocks but also to ensure our rightful place as a full economic actor.  Twenty years ago  global leaders meeting at Rio de Janeiro set forward a high international benchmark for sustainable development  crafting a range of strategies and commitments. Next year  the critical United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development must not only focus on moving towards a global green economy but must also pay specific attention to a global “blue economy” — one that ensures specific  measurable and time-bound targets for guaranteeing the sustainability of the global oceans and their fish stocks  particularly in regions dotted by small island States like my own. Greater commitment is needed to utilize targeted global high seas closures  thereby ensuring sustainable fisheries  as we are already doing in the Pacific. The hour is past for vague rhetoric. Leaders must respond with action rather than continued neglect for the world’s oceans.  The Marshall Islands warmly welcomed the visit this month by the Secretary-General to the Pacific region. The Secretary-General was able to see for himself the vulnerability and existential threat facing low-lying island States. He has now rightfully challenged world leaders to respond. What were once theoretical and distant risks are now on the verge of becoming our reality.  International climate negotiations are at serious risk of entering a phase of political stalemate. Negotiators have spent more than two decades in complicated processes that have delivered very little in terms of practical action to mitigate the climate change problem. Often blocked by only a handful of countries  the international community is still unable to commit to emissions cuts and targets sufficient to ensure the survival of the Marshall Islands and other low-lying nations.  The Marshall Islands can wait no longer. We are now choosing creative paths to drive urgency into our broken negotiations and to pursue practical initiatives to address the threats and risks. First  the Marshall Islands joined with the Government of Mexico in urging the United Nations in its coming Climate Change Conference to consider the use of voting as a means of last resort. Secondly  in July  we joined with our Pacific small island developing States colleagues to push for the Security Council to recognize that climate change now poses an incontrovertible threat to international peace and security.   We reiterate our call for the Secretary-General to report on those threats. Petty arguments about forums and mandates cannot be allowed to prevail at the risk of our statehood. All organs of the United Nations must now be proactively engaged. We do not need sympathy; we need solutions and political innovation.  Thirdly  the Marshall Islands is carefully studying options for clarifying the relevant international obligations related to climate change and how it affects our statehood. Working with our close neighbour  the Republic of Palau  we are committed to pursuing requests for legal advisory opinions from international tribunals in order to recognize the international legal principles that address questions of our survival and security in the context of climate risks. We have also agreed to work with Palau and other vulnerable and low-lying countries to formulate and advance our own legally binding climate agreement. We  the most vulnerable  must act when others lack the political will to do so.   As a significant global economic leader  Taiwan can make substantial contributions to the international community. The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes increased dialogue on key cross-Strait issues. That progress deserves recognition by the international community. Given that the primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace  the world cannot afford to overlook Taiwan’s strong efforts in promoting peace   15 11-51398  and stability in the Asia-Pacific region  including with regard to climate change.  The 2009 invitation by the World Health Organization for Taiwan to participate as an observer has not only benefited global medical progress  including on non-communicable diseases  but also serves as an effective model for its wider participation in other key organizations. We urge the United Nations and its Member States to consider that model and develop effective means for Taiwan’s participation in specialized agencies  including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  The Security Council must transform itself into an effective and contemporary body. The Security Council should be restructured to accommodate those nations whose size  leadership and responsibility  in particular the Group of Four — Japan  Germany  India and Brazil — warrants a permanent presence in the Council. Further efforts should be made to ensure that Africa and small nations  including island States  have improved access and an amplified voice.  The General Assembly witnessed a historic moment last week  in which  for the first time  the general debate was initiated by a woman  namely  President Rousseff of Brazil. The Marshall Islands welcomes the Secretary-General’s renewed priority on addressing gender  including a strengthened UN-Women institution  particularly in the Pacific.  The message for nuclear weapons  global security and climate change is the same: international law is not an empty promise."
"114",4596,"MKD",66,2011,"It is my special honour and privilege to address this important forum and to share with the Assembly the positions of the Republic of Macedonia regarding current issues on the United Nations agenda.  First  allow me to congratulate His Excellency Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the prestigious position of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to congratulate the previous President  Mr. Joseph Deiss  on his remarkably successful presidency at the sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment  confident that he will continue to work devotedly to realize the noble objectives of the United Nations.  The Republic of Macedonia recently celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence. We have faced many challenges and temptations  including achieving a peaceful declaration of independence  the introduction of a new political system with due respect for democratic values and human rights and freedoms  transforming our economic system and then dealing with many social problems  establishing ourselves as a responsible and active member of the international community  and shouldering the additional burden of various requirements and conditions.  Throughout this time  the Republic of Macedonia has had the United Nations as a partner. Based on lessons learned over the past 20 years  my country is particularly conscious of the value of mediation in the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Macedonia welcomes the timely and wise decision to make the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means the focus of this year’s debate.   The majority of conflicts do not happen overnight; they are predictable and offer realistic opportunities for effective diplomatic efforts to prevent them. Such cases offer the chance of incurring the lowest cost in every way. While we affirm the sovereignty of States  we must take into consideration that there are moments when a State or States need mediation services  with impartiality and willingness on the part of the mediators to understand the thrust of the issues and to help all parties concerned resolve their problems in a mutually acceptable and satisfactory manner before they can escalate in an unwanted direction.  The Millennium Development Goals remain the parameters we need to evaluate our success. Regardless of the serious consequences of the global economic crisis  our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals must not weaken. The greatest crises occur as a result of a lack of vision and dedication. Turning a blind eye to problems or finding excuses to justify a lack of action to achieve our goals will only increase the price to be paid in future; and that will not be calculated merely in dollars or euros  but also in the most valuable and priceless asset: human lives.  One challenge that requires an immediate and long-term solution is the issue of climate change. It is alarming that  precisely as a result of climate change caused by human activity  entire nations and States face uncertainty on a daily basis. Although the Republic of Macedonia has experienced the adverse effects of climate change in a less dramatic way  it wishes to express its solidarity with the countries that are most exposed to the phenomenon.  In recent times  we have witnessed numerous conflicts and the disturbance of peace and security in various regions of the world. The democratic awakening  especially the so-called Arab Spring  has shown us once more that democracy cannot be imposed; it can be derived only from the people’s rejection of dictatorships and regimes that are in conflict with the popular interest  and from respect for basic human rights  universal freedoms and the rule of law.   Old and frozen conflicts remain a global challenge. The problem of the abuse of programmes intended for the peaceful use of nuclear energy has not yet been solved. Terrorism and extreme hunger caused by conflicts are only two of the numerous challenges to which it is imperative that we find immediate solutions    11-51360 34  aimed at improving security at the global and regional levels.  Human beings must be the focus of our attention  especially in national policy and  of course  in multilateral actions. There is no greater value than human life  human dignity and the right to individual development  prosperity and happiness. Humankind requires action that transforms our declarations and good intentions into deeds. When we ask for that moral imperative from the United Nations  we are practicing what we preach. The Republic of Macedonia will continue to be an active participant in the realization of our common objectives.  There are many words I could use to describe my country  and each and every one would fit perfectly in its own manner. But to begin with  I choose only one  and I am convinced that it describes the essence of my country and my people and accurately illustrates all the efforts and strength we have summoned in order to overcome the challenges of our recent history. It clearly describes the patience with which we have faced every obstacle imposed on us  and which we have overcome and continue to overcome  at the economic and institutional level  simply by asserting our own identity and self-recognition. These obstacles have been imposed not because of anything we have done  but simply because of who we are and the fact that we exist. That word is “responsibility”.  Macedonia has acted responsibly. Our country’s independence was won through a history that cannot be called merciful. It rests on the great sacrifice of many lives and broken dreams. Yet our past is not the only reason why we act responsibly. We Macedonians believe that we have a European future and that we can leave a great legacy for generations to come. That is precisely why today we in Macedonia are trying to create a broad base of support and to unify all of our strength and potential around the bold idea of Macedonia as a regional leader in economic reform  education  investment  technology and innovation; in protection of the environment and of human rights and freedoms; and in all areas of modern life. Knowing the great awareness and responsibility of my people — and citing the example of country’s response to the global economic crisis  when our solidarity was not shaken and we came through it all without major problems — I am convinced that our unity will succeed.  When speaking of Macedonia  however  we cannot fail to mention another great characteristic that has remained with us over thousands of years. As our inheritance from ancient times  this characteristic has helped us to retain our cosmopolitanism — the ideal that has enabled us to maintain a functional multiculturalism. Side by side  throughout the centuries  different cultures  religions and nations have coexisted in my country. While many Europeans deem that astonishing and unique  for us Macedonians that has been the situation for centuries. We aim for incorporation into the dominant culture  without any assimilation or disintegration. Unlike many others who  afraid for their own national myth  try to suppress differences  we are proud of them and consider them our treasure.  Our system is not perfect  and we have many issues to resolve. Macedonia is on the verge of a great transformation  which will not happen overnight. We  like every other nation in the world  have the right to an identity and to unite around our own national myth. In our myth  there is a place for Macedonians  Albanians  Turks  Roma  Serbs  Vlachs  Bosniaks and others. There is a place for all who accept the virtues of non-violence  justice  coexistence and cultural competitiveness. Chauvinism has never been dominant among our people. The constitutional amendments of 1993 and the change in our flag showed our goodwill  openness and cooperativeness. However  our sense of responsibility and our maturity should not be considered as weaknesses  nor should they be a reason for continuous abuse from anyone  because we have dignity and pride. We know who we are and how we will live. We are Macedonians  we speak Macedonian  and our country’s name is the Republic of Macedonia.  As Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia  I would be remiss if I were to neglect the issue of our name and identity and our southern neighbour’s objection to both. I mention this not only because of my position and obligation to the people of the Republic of Macedonia  but also because it relates in many ways directly to the issue of the peaceful resolution of conflict and the role that mediation plays.   We do not like being in the position of having our name and identity opposed by one country  and we certainly did not ask for it. But reality is often cold  hard and brutal. The fact is that our southern neighbour objects to both our name and identity; its objection has become our problem  and a dispute has arisen that is   35 11-51360  unique in the world. It is imposed on the basis of the need of one country  our neighbour  to monopolize two names  and its strategic determination that we should not exist as we feel ourselves to be.   Imagine the state that my citizens find themselves in — blackmailed  with their development and prospects jeopardized  blocked by our southern neighbour from joining euro-Atlantic institutions  just because of what we are and what we feel like. I personally  and literally all of the citizens of my country  cannot believe that we have been put in a situation where we have to resolve a dispute that was artificially created and absurd. I believe that it is also utterly incomprehensible to all present. I would ask participants in this meeting to imagine  just for a moment  that they are in our shoes  to consider how they would feel if someone demanded they not be French  German  British  American  Russian  Chinese  Nigerian  Japanese  Argentine  Uruguayan or Kenyan  for instance. That is the only thing I ask  the only thing I plead for. I ask for support to end this  to allow us to be what we are. We hurt no one and inflict damage on no one. We have understanding  tolerance and respect for our neighbours and friends and for everyone. We have respect for the neighbour with which we are having this dispute and an understanding of its fears. We have no pretensions  nor do we have any intention of monopolizing the name Macedonia.  Please help us to be proud and dignified and to avoid a solution that would break us. We seek a solution that will not harm our spirit and a name that will recognize our commitment  desire and determination for coexistence  community  individuality and identity as well as our sense of belonging to the world — this world that we are building  whose virtues we are establishing and whose future we are fighting for. Macedonians are a peaceful people and are working  with mediation  to resolve the dispute with our neighbour in a peaceful manner.  In a speech to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia on 31 August 2001  our late President  Boris Trajkovski  said:   “We demand that the international community recognize us by our name — the Republic of Macedonia — and not by a fictional derivative. It is high time that the world recognizes us by what we call ourselves  just like any other country and its citizens. Otherwise  how do you expect us to believe in your values  principles and intentions if you deny our basic right  the right to identity?”  Fortunately  131 countries around the world have made a choice to recognize us by what we call ourselves — the Republic of Macedonia — and for that we thank them. We thank them for their principled position and consistency in the values of protection of the rights and principles established by the United Nations itself. Unfortunately  the rules of the world are such that we cannot be called by what we call ourselves in this very body. Nor can we join organizations we have worked hard to become members of  and  in the case of NATO and the European Union  have earned a right to be a part of. This  frankly  is wrong. There is no other word for it. What others choose to do about it — their behaviour — is entirely up to them.  It is a great honour and great privilege to address this body. All of us are leaders of our people and all of us represent them to the best of our abilities. But we must recommit ourselves as leaders to our own peoples first  and to the peoples of this world second. If we do that  we can survive  we can succeed and we can build a better world for ourselves  our children  our grandchildren and for future generations  which  ultimately is what each and every one of us wants."
"115",4640,"MLI",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to convey the regrets of His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré  President of the Republic of Mali  who  owing to a particularly busy national schedule at this time  was unable to attend the current session of the General Assembly. However  he asked me to convey his most cordial greetings and sincere wishes for the success of our work.  The Mali delegation is particularly pleased to convey to Mr. Al-Nasser its heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His election is not only a just recognition of his exceptional qualities as a seasoned diplomat  but also a tremendous tribute to his country  Qatar  with which Mali enjoys excellent relations. I therefore assure him of the support and full cooperation of my delegation in discharging his mission. Allow me also to express my great appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the superb manner in which he presided over the sixty-fifth session  which has just ended  to the satisfaction of all Member States.   Finally  I should like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his outstanding re-election as the head of the Organization. I remain fully convinced that his unswerving commitment to upholding the principles and ideals of the Organization and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will help to strengthen further the role of the United Nations on the international scene.  The current global context is marked by profound political upheavals that gravely threaten international peace and security. This situation makes the theme chosen for the general debate — “The role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes” — all the more pertinent. I should therefore like first to stress the important role of mediation and the urgency of renewed collective efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and  above all  to put a halt to violence  the untold suffering inflicted on civilian populations  and the massive destruction of socio-economic infrastructure.    5 11-51197   My country remains convinced that the prevention of conflicts and their resolution through mediation are undoubtedly guarantees of peace and lasting security. In that regard  Mali will continue to encourage and support all initiatives and mediation efforts under way with a view to combating the root causes of conflicts and paving the way to a lasting political solution able to guarantee peace  stability and security  without which there can be no socio-economic development. Part of this process are the promotion of good-neighbourly relations and peaceful coexistence  the non-use of force in dispute settlement  understanding and mutual respect  the bolstering of international cooperation  and the culture of peace and dialogue among religions and civilizations.  The events under way in the world are of concern to us in that they clearly demonstrate that the quest for peace and security remains the most pressing challenge. In Africa  while outstanding progress has been made in promoting peace  security and stability  the fact remains that the situation in the Horn of Africa and in North Africa  particularly in Libya  remains a source of major concern. Today more than ever  weapons and deadly confrontations must give way to the imperative of dialogue and national reconciliation  which are required to establish lasting peace  consolidate national unity and maintain territorial integrity.  In the Middle East  the Palestinian question is and remains a source of major concern to the international community  which must encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to take the steps necessary to establish a climate of trust and launch direct negotiations towards a comprehensive peace underpinned  inter alia  on the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. While reiterating its active solidarity and total support to the Palestinian people in their just  legitimate struggle  Mali will continue to support all initiatives towards the creation of an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel within secure  internationally recognized borders.  International peace and security continue to be threatened by other phenomena  such as international terrorism  cross-border organized crime  and the traffic in weapons  drugs and human beings. The attacks perpetrated throughout the world are stark reminders that no country is safe from terrorism  and that no cause  howsoever just  can justify the deliberate use of violence against innocent civilians.   In that regard  I note the security challenges in the vast Sahelo-Saharan strip that Mali shares with several brother countries in the region. Our subregion faces today the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the trafficking of drugs and human beings fuelled by organized crime networks in collusion with terrorist groups. The events in Libya and their collateral effects could further aggravate this already worrisome situation.   Aware of the threats posed by these phenomena to the stability and harmonious development of the region  the Governments of the countries concerned have worked to establish joint operational mechanisms to combat our common enemies effectively. For its part  the Government of Mali reaffirms its full support for all initiatives of the States of the subregion seeking to better coordinate and harmonize our efforts to meet the multiple common challenges. Parallel to efforts at the subregional level  our Government is intensifying its efforts to implement the Special Programme for Peace  Security and Development in Northern Mali.  The year 2012 will be an important one for Mali. After almost 20 years of democratic institutional practices  the President of the Republic  who will not stand for re-election  saw fit to revise the 1992 Constitution  following broad national consultations  in order to consolidate democracy  good governance and the rule of law in our country.  A participative  inclusive process has already been opened with all stakeholders — the Government  political parties  national deputies and civil society — to guarantee the transparency and credibility of future referendums and future. I reiterate the commitment of the Government to do its utmost to smoothly implement the envisaged reforms and meet the challenge of holding successful elections in 2012. I remain confident of success as our democracy has matured over the past four elections. This progress has been inspired from Malian culture based on dialogue  tolerance and sharing.   The people of Mali share the ambition of the Government to build a strong  united Mali — a democratic and stable Mali resolutely committed to peace  dialogue and international cooperation. They also share the determination of the Government to create the conditions for true prosperity in order to    11-51197 6  make Mali an emerging economy in the medium term. That is why I solemnly call from this rostrum on the international community and development partners to support the electoral process under way and our efforts to meet the challenge of organizing a constitutional referendum and free  transparent and democratic elections.  As a Sahelo-Saharan country facing the phenomenon of desertification and unpredictable rainfall  Mali considers climate change to be one of the major challenges affecting the survival and development of humankind. That is why we are present at all meetings on this issue  as borne out by our recent participation at the High-level Meeting on the theme “Addressing desertification  land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication”. I reaffirm Mali’s commitment to continuing to step up its actions to preserve and conserve the soils  forests and fauna  in step with the national and international commitments of our country.  The sessions of the General Assembly also offer us a chance to take stock of the severity of other challenges facing the world. I think in particular of the struggle against HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and non-communicable diseases  which were the subject of High-level Meetings on 19 and 20 September. In addition to the challenges they pose to public health  these scourges have become a real problem for development. The international community must  we believe  redouble its efforts and its vigilance to contain these illnesses. It will also have to deliver on its commitments to the developing countries in order to allow them to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.   It is also important to give sustained attention to the issue of reform and democratization of the United Nations by giving a greater role to women in decision-making in political  economic and security forums. It is also important to democratize the international financial institutions  bearing in mind the huge changes that have taken place in the world and the need for better representation for all regions.  The global economic situation certainly remains fragile  but the financial crisis should not become a pretext for reducing official development assistance (ODA). The implementation of the Programme of Action for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals must remain a priority. The international community must revive its collective will to put into practice and even go beyond commitments undertaken in the field of ODA in order to combat poverty and all forms of injustice that breed violence and insecurity throughout the world.   Similarly  the implementation of the Istanbul Political Declaration and Programme of Action for the least developed countries (LDCs) for the decade 2011-2020 will allow the LDCs to marshal the necessary financial resources to ensure the lasting growth and development that guarantee peace and stability in the world. In that regard  Mali will continue to support all innovative initiatives in development financing  trade  the alleviation of foreign debt  and technology transfer to developing countries in general and LDCS in particular.  In our quest for a safer and more just  prosperous and peaceful world  the best way to guarantee our common future is to strengthen cooperation and international solidarity. Let us engage collectively to find lasting solutions to the challenges and complex problems facing humankind. It is in the interest of us all and in the interest of our collective survival."
"116",4683,"MLT",66,2011,"I heartily congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish him every success and assure him that Malta  which enjoys excellent relations and increasing cooperation with his country  Qatar  will extend its full support and collaboration in the tasks ahead of him. I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his leadership and effective role over the last 12 months.  I would also like to convey my warm and sincere congratulations to His Excellency Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to serve our Organization as its Secretary-General for another term. My Government would like to put on record its appreciation for his firm and capable leadership.  Just two months ago this Assembly admitted by acclamation the Republic of South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations. Malta is proud to have been one of the Member States co-sponsoring the resolution that ushered the new nation-State of the Republic of South Sudan into the world community of nations (resolution 65/308).  Throughout the 12 months that have passed since we last gathered here in this Assembly  we have all been witness to the continuing upheavals and crises resulting from the strife  poverty and social inequalities that unfortunately persist in many parts of the world. This situation has been compounded by food insecurity  which in turn is exacerbated by the drought and famine that threaten the survival of millions of people  particularly in Somalia and the rest of the Horn of Africa.  Malta has long recognized the difficulties facing countries in the Horn of Africa and has directed most of its development and humanitarian aid to them through development projects. The participation of Maltese non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in implementing those projects has been pivotal in enabling Malta to help relieve some of the most pressing needs. My Government has also answered the call of the United Nations for financial contributions to assist in alleviating the sufferings of people in the Horn of Africa. This we did through the Central Emergency Response Fund.  It is a matter of concern  however  that only four years remain to meet the goals that we unanimously agreed  in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 (resolution 55/2)  to achieve by 2015. We acknowledge  of course  that progress has been made in some critical areas  notwithstanding continuing adversities. But we are still not there.   Within its limited means  Malta has been able to financially assist and support NGOs and interested individuals to carry out projects in developing and least developed countries. Over the past 19 months  these projects have included building schools  clinics  centres for persons with disabilities  social housing  and extensions at hospitals in various countries in Africa  as well as in Central and South America.  My Government continues to ask the membership of this Organization to consider the case for assistance in dealing with the influx of illegal immigrants who are continuing to reach Malta as a result of the situation in Libya and North Africa. We continue to call for international solidarity and burden-sharing in dealing with this phenomenon. It is also our hope that the European Union’s Asylum Support Office  which opened in Malta in June  will contribute to the task of streamlining asylum policies in the European Union and its member States and improve cooperation among the authorities. In that context  may I express the appreciation of the Government of Malta for the assistance we have received so far from a number of European States and the United States of America in the resettlement process.  The Mediterranean  which links Europe  Africa and the Middle East  has not been spared the many challenges and difficulties facing other parts of the world. It is  however  also seeing the birth of hope in the form of a new political and social reality as a result of the sacrifices being made by the peoples of Tunisia  Egypt  Libya and Syria as they strive to take back the political leadership of their countries. Malta salutes these brave people.  As we heard a few minutes ago from His Excellency Mr. Jibreel  who spoke on behalf of Libya  these are turbulent times for Libya  a crucial and momentous point in the history of the Libyan people. During this time  Malta  which over the course of its history has earned the title “nurse of the   51 11-51360  Mediterranean”  has also been serving as a safe harbour  where thousands have found refuge and assistance.   As a Member of this esteemed Organization  of the European Union and of the international contact group on Libya  my Government has provided  over the past several months  a humanitarian hub for the evacuation of nearly 20 000 people  medical assistance and relief efforts by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  including such United Nations agencies as the World Food Programme. Malta is proud of this role  which it continues to play in alleviating hardships  particularly those of the Libyan people  to this very day.  As a result of the courage  vision and tenacity of its people  Libya is today on the threshold of assuming its place in the community of free and democratic nations. The approach taken by the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) over these recent  highly charged weeks has undoubtedly enhanced its standing and legitimacy. We welcome the NTC’s determination to ensure that justice  and not vengeance  will be pursued by these brave people. It is important that the process of national reconciliation take hold as soon as possible and that it be underpinned by the fullest respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all segments of the population.  Allow me  at this juncture  to take this opportunity to join others in welcoming the delegation of Libya as the new and rightful representatives of Libya to the United Nations and in this Assembly.  The next few months will be a major challenge for the international community and the people of Libya alike. At this defining moment the Libyan people deserve the fullest international solidarity on the political  economic and financial fronts. My Government supports United Nations leadership in the international community’s programme of action and endorses the three fundamental principles under which the United Nations intends to operate: Libyan national ownership  rapid response and delivery and  lastly  effective coordination. Close coordination  in particular with the European Union  which we believe to be a key player in post-conflict assistance and support  will be especially crucial in this scenario.  Egypt and Tunisia also deserve every encouragement as they embark on the reforms ahead. Democratic transition processes need to be sustained  including from the economic perspective. A holistic approach is a crucial element in maximizing international endeavours  not least to stimulate economic growth. Democracy stands a better chance of flourishing if there is economic development and tangible improvement in living standards enjoyed by the entire population.  At a time when people in the Middle East  North Africa and beyond have embarked on a new path towards freedom  dignity and prosperity  we must also invest our efforts and determination to fulfil the long-sought aspirations of the Palestinian people. The dramatic developments unfolding in the Arab world make progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track even more urgent than before.   Malta was heartened by  and welcomed  the speech of President Obama last May  in which he laid out the foundation for future negotiations and outlined a comprehensive vision for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The resumption of meaningful and sustainable negotiations seemed  at the time  to be within reach.  Unfortunately  that was not to be. The time frames set by the international community for the establishment of a Palestinian State are now with us. A political stalemate persists  despite the fact that from an institutional perspective  the preparations for statehood have been successfully completed. The situation on the ground further complicates matters and undermines the resumption of negotiations and the goal of two viable States living side by side in peace.  No effort should be spared to break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Getting Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table with the political will necessary to embark on meaningful and sustainable negotiations must remain the overriding goal. Agreement on parameters for negotiations would clearly be a step in the right direction. In this regard  Malta fully stands behind the efforts of the European Union  particularly those of its High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  to make this happen.  My Government strongly believes that the elements set out in the conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union in December 2009  December 2010 and May 2011 provide balanced parameters for the resumption of negotiations.    11-51360 52   Two weeks ago  the New York community and the American people were joined by the international community in commemorating the victims of one of the most heinous crimes committed in recent history. We all remember with sadness and sorrow that fateful day of 11 September 2001  when the hand of evil carried out a terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in downtown New York. The 10 years that have passed since that tragic event  when nearly 3 000 innocent people met their deaths and thousands more were wounded  have not erased the scars or the pain.  Terrorism continues to respect no frontiers. Many States have been and continue to be the victims of deadly attacks by terrorists. In Afghanistan  Iraq  India  Pakistan  Russia  Spain  Indonesia  the United Kingdom and China  terrorism has struck with intensity and brutality. Only one month ago  another reprehensible and deadly attack was carried out  on the United Nations complex in Nigeria. Malta strongly condemns those cowardly and horrible acts and pledges to continue to work with other Member States to ensure that such criminal acts are not only condemned in absolute terms  but also suppressed.  The events unfolding in North Africa highlight that we must continue to promote and protect human rights across the world. That is a responsibility that our present generation bears on behalf of future generations. It was in that spirit that  in my address to the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009 (see A/64/PV.6)  I proposed the drafting of a universal declaration of human responsibilities  as the second part of a diptych to be formed with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such a declaration would be open for signature to any Member State wishing to subscribe to it.  We have been encouraged to move forward in presenting such a draft declaration by a number of Member States that share with us a belief in the growing need to embrace responsibilities and duties in the international setting. In the light of that positive response  my Government intends to call an international gathering in 2012  at the official level but with the presence of experts  to examine the draft declaration that will have been prepared and finalize it in such a way that it can be opened for signature in 2012. Malta strongly believes that such a declaration would strengthen the solidarity that our rapidly changing world demands.  In conclusion  allow me to state that the environmental sustainability of our planet is one of the priorities of my Government. Malta is working towards a successful outcome at next year’s United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in the hope that it will build further on the commitments agreed at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In that context  since 1988  when Malta put the protection of climate for present and future generations on the political agenda of the Organization  my Government has worked to support and endorse efforts that address climate change. Malta has also made a contribution to the Special Climate Change Fund.  The coming 12 months under the presidency of Ambassador Al-Nasser offer the membership of the Organization challenging and exciting times. The agenda of the Assembly is long and demanding. We recognize that the President’s task will not be at all easy  and we assure him of our full support.  Malta will also continue to shoulder its international responsibilities with vigour  commitment and determination. We stand ready to work with other Member States to make the Organization stronger and better able to tackle the global challenges facing mankind."
"117",4729,"MMR",66,2011,"Allow me to extend our congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the Presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that with his wide knowledge  experience and diplomatic skills  we will be able to achieve fruitful results in our deliberations in addressing important and critical issues on the international agenda.  I would also like to convey our appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his able leadership and contributions to the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. May I also take this opportunity to once again extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his reappointment  and we wish to express our sincere appreciation to him for his dedication and untiring efforts for the cause of the United Nations.  Since I am addressing the General Assembly for the first time after the emergence of the constitutional Government and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar  I would like to apprise the Assembly of recent developments and significant changes taking place in my country. The Republic of the Union of Myanmar has emerged as a new democratic nation in accordance with the Constitution approved by the overwhelming majority of the people.   Multiparty democratic general elections were held in Myanmar in November 2010 in line with the seven-step roadmap. Thirty-seven political parties  including 19 parties from different national ethnic groups  contested in the elections. Today  elected representatives are exercising their democratic rights in the legislative bodies.  The President  in his inaugural speech to the first regular session of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw on 30 March 2011  stated that all elected Hluttaw members  including the President  are duty-bound to honour and safeguard the Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. The new Government pledged that all citizens shall enjoy equal rights under the law and is determined to strengthen the judiciary. The Government also assured the nation that it will amend and revoke existing laws and adopt new laws as may be deemed necessary to implement the provisions of the fundamental rights of the citizens.  With a view to maintaining and promoting friendly relations with all countries in the world  Myanmar is reaching out to the international community. In the past five months  Myanmar has received the visits of State leaders and high-level delegations from our neighbouring countries  as well as from other regions and international organizations. In return  President Thein Sein paid official visits to the Republic of Indonesia and the People’s Republic of China. The President also attended the eighteenth summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Jakarta.  The new Government has launched a series of economic  social and policy reforms designed to improve the socio-economic life of the people of Myanmar. One of those measures is the stepping up of    11-51670 24  its efforts to reduce poverty. In Myanmar  about 70 per cent of the population resides in rural areas and engages in agricultural and livestock farming. In order to boost production and enhance the economic development of rural areas  the Government has adopted forward-looking economic policies. Those policies will lead to sustained  inclusive and equitable economic growth  which will in turn increase employment opportunities  promote agriculture development and reduce poverty.   Towards that end  the new Government has adopted the National Rural Development and Poverty Reduction Plan to alleviate poverty and to improve the livelihood of people residing in rural areas. A central committee and various work committees have been formed to supplement the eight tasks laid down under the National Plan. Furthermore  the new Government has increased pension allowances for retired service personnel commensurate with the changing economic and social conditions of the country. With a view to encouraging foreign trade  the Government reduced the export tax from 8 per cent to 2 per cent and granted export tax exemptions for all agricultural and timber products.  It is regrettable that the Government’s efforts to improve the livelihood of the people of Myanmar are being hampered by economic sanctions. I would therefore like to call upon countries that have imposed unilateral sanctions on my country to lift those restrictions. It will also contribute to our efforts to achieve our Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets.  Myanmar attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of human rights. The fundamental rights of the country’s citizens are guaranteed by relevant provisions of the State Constitution. With a view to promoting and safeguarding the fundamental rights of its citizens as set forth in the Constitution  the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission was formed on 5 September 2011.  Myanmar’s cooperation with the United Nations has been clearly demonstrated by the Government’s acceptance of the fourth visit of Mr. Tomás Ojea Quintana  the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar in August 2011. Mr. Quintana recognized and welcomed the steps taken by the Government to improve the human rights situation in the country. He also welcomed the Government’s stated commitments to reform and the priorities set forth by the President.  Myanmar has been cooperating closely with the United Nations Human Rights Council. Myanmar’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) report was submitted and reviewed by the UPR Working Group last January and adopted at the seventeenth session of the Human Rights Council last June. Myanmar has agreed to accept 52.4 per cent of the total recommendations. We strongly believe that the UPR process is the most dependable and non-controversial monitoring mechanism for addressing and rectifying the human rights situations of all countries.  As for national reconciliation  the Government offered an olive branch to all the ethnic armed groups in the country through Announcement No. 1/2011 on 18 August  and some of those groups have accepted the Government’s offer. The Government also granted an amnesty on 16 May 2011  with 20 000 inmates having been released by the end of July. I would like to take this opportunity to inform the General Assembly that the President  in exercising the mandate vested in him by the Constitution  will grant a further amnesty at an appropriate time in the near future.  The President invited people to work together for the interest of the nation despite differences. Accordingly  he received Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on 19 August 2011  and  putting aside differing views  they had candid and cordial discussions with a view to finding common ground and exploring a potential cooperation in the interest of the nation and its people.  The foregoing are some of the significant items of progress we have achieved in our democratization process.  As an agro-based country  Myanmar is following with keen interest the issues involving the effects of climate change. Since agriculture is highly dependent on the climate  the implications of the climatic situation on agriculture cannot be ignored. Lately  floods and droughts have devastated crops and agricultural production in our region. It is evident that developing countries are the most vulnerable and will therefore be the first to suffer from global warming and climate change.  We therefore look forward to reaching tangible outcomes at the upcoming seventeenth Conference of   25 11-51670  the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the seventh Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Durban  South Africa. Although the road to Durban will be a difficult one  my delegation shares the view that our discussions on the issue should be placed within the context of promoting sustainable development. In that regard  we would also like to stress that all three pillars  namely  economic development  social development and environmental protection  need to be promoted in an integrated  coordinated and balanced manner.  Myanmar strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In today’s world  terrorism and transnational organized crime are increasingly threatening human society. Myanmar is also among those countries that have been victim of the scourge of terrorism. In that regard  we would like to express our deepest condolences to the bereaved families of victims of terrorism around the world. We welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment to conducting a global threat review in order to re-assess security threats in the wake of the deadly attack in Abuja  Nigeria. Myanmar stands ready to cooperate at the regional and international levels to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational organized crimes. Without a stable and peaceful environment  sustainable development would not be possible for the people of a country or in a region and beyond.  The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  which were formulated to address the welfare and needs of people around the world. Despite some progress  development efforts have been hindered by various factors  such as slow economic growth  diminishing resources  increasing food prices and ongoing concern over food security  increasingly frequent natural disasters and the challenges posed by climate change. Each country has the primary responsibility to generate its ways and means for achieving social and economic development. However  national efforts to that end need to be supported by the international community.  For our part  Myanmar is determined to promote better living standards and the equitable development of its people. To generate income  microfinance schemes have been introduced at the grassroots level. According to the United Nations Development Programme  the poverty rate in Myanmar has decreased from 32 per cent to 26 per cent in recent years. However  we have to redouble our efforts to achieve MDG 1 by the year 2015.  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons  promote nuclear disarmament and cooperation  and ensure access to nuclear energy. As a signatory to the Treaty  Myanmar remains committed to the three pillars of the treaty. As a strong advocate of nuclear disarmament  Myanmar has been tabling a draft resolution on nuclear disarmament every year since 1995  one which enjoys wide support from Member States. Myanmar firmly opposes the proliferation and production of nuclear weapons and strongly supports any efforts leading to the realization of a world free of the threat of nuclear weapons and their by-products.  Recently  the world around us has changed. We have seen changes in Governments and political landscapes. Myanmar has transformed and is moving towards becoming a democratic nation in a smooth and peaceful manner. We have now embarked on a series of reforms in various sectors to bring about democratization and economic development and improve the lives of our people.  The steps taken by the Government of Myanmar are concrete  visible and irreversible. We will ensure that the reform process is incremental  systematic and dynamic. Myanmar is strongly determined to continue implementing the democratization process despite all of the current challenges. At this critical juncture  the encouragement  understanding and support of the international community are crucial to Myanmar’s transition to democracy."
"118",4740,"MNE",66,2011,"It is truly an honour for me to address the Assembly at this global forum on behalf of Montenegro and to reiterate our commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and its Charter.  I hereby wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to pledge the full support of the Montenegrin delegation as he carries out his demanding task. I also wish to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his valuable contribution and for strengthening the central role of the United Nations in the global system during his presidency of the General Assembly.  I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment  which I am certain will result in the continuation of the reforms undertaken to build a more efficient and coherent United Nations system  and thus a safer and more prosperous world.  Two months ago  Montenegro was replaced by South Sudan as the youngest Member of our Organization. I wish to congratulate South Sudan on its independence and its full-fledged membership in this body. I truly believe that this milestone will contribute to security and serve as a good starting point for the development of good-neighbourly relations.  We also support the democratization processes in North Africa  as well as the actions taken by the United Nations and the African Union in Côte d’Ivoire  Somalia  the Congo and other parts of Africa to further the overall progress of the entire continent.  In the context of regional cooperation  Montenegro has contributed to overall stability in South-East Europe by chairing the most important regional initiatives  which has been a unique and rather challenging experience for our Administration. Montenegro is committed to further developing mutual understanding and to strengthening all forms of cooperation in the future. Our success and that of the countries of our region is the success of Europe  too.  There is full consensus on the issue of European Union integration in Montenegro. We are aware of the fact that this process requires continuous contributions from all stakeholders in our society. I am convinced that we will have enough will  enthusiasm  capacity and energy to tackle it during the forthcoming period.  I hope and believe that persistent and committed work on the implementation of overall internal reforms  based on the seven key recommendations underlined by the European Commission and accompanied by a policy of good-neighbourly relations and regional and international cooperation  represent a solid foundation for the European Commission to recommend  in its progress report to the European Council  that European Union (EU) accession talks be opened with Montenegro.  We are taking firm steps forward on the Euro-Atlantic path and are currently preparing our second Annual National Programme as part of the NATO membership process. The progress of the Western Balkan countries towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration is a key factor for regional stability and lays the groundwork for long-term economic prosperity.  As a United Nations Member State and a reliable international partner  Montenegro is committed to the maintenance of international peace and security. Consistent with its capacities  Montenegro actively participates in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Cyprus  while also keeping in mind the regional security aspects.  Through our participation in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force  we directly contribute to the efforts of the international community to ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan  while at the same time supporting global efforts in the fight against terrorism. Through the EU ATALANTA mission  we have joined the fight against piracy  the consequences   5 11-51360  of which have also been suffered by Montenegrin sailors.  Nevertheless  in order to prevent new conflicts that have the potential to cause humanitarian disasters and put additional pressure on the already-burdened peacekeeping mission contingents  it is necessary to strengthen preventive diplomacy and mediation activities in cases of potential and initiated conflict. The further development of United Nations capacities in this domain will contribute to the timely and peaceful resolution of conflicts before their complexities lead to serious international repercussions.  In that regard  Montenegro strongly supports the peaceful resolution of all existing conflicts  especially those in the wider region of the Middle East and North Africa. Priority should be given to the urgent signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine  which is in their mutual interest. Only if both sides refrain from violent actions will room be created for confidence-building and a comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue  making Israel a safe country  to the benefit of both internationally recognized sides and meeting the prerequisites for Palestine to establish a stable State.   Montenegro also supports all the Security Council resolutions and actions taken by the international community aimed at stopping human rights violations and fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of populations  especially in Libya and Syria.  Montenegro supports the principles of the universality of human rights and the inadmissibility of violating them or resolutions promoting their protection and enhancement. We also support the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council  to which we have announced our candidature for the period 2013-2015. Experience that Montenegro gained in its turbulent past  when it provided shelter to refugees  can serve as a basis for achieving long-lasting political compromises aimed at securing peace in the region. In our view  the Universal Periodic Review is an important instrument for assessing the status of human rights in the world.  I wish to emphasize our support of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  and the importance of all of the international tribunals  especially when it comes to systematic violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms. They not only serve as an example and guide for national courts  but they also function as a clear deterrent to and inescapable destination for individuals who ignore the rules established by the Geneva Conventions.  Montenegro  as an ethnically  culturally and religiously diverse society  is an active member of the Group of Friends of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and is committed to the fundamental principles of integration  the strengthening of civil society  tolerance and the fight against all forms of discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance. We are determined and committed to preserving the fundamental values that civil society is based upon  no matter what the challenges are and no matter what the challenges that we  as a society and a State  will have to face in the future.  Let me also briefly point out our current economic developments. The fact that we are a small and open economy  and therefore vulnerable to changes in the global economic market  resulted in the global economic and financial crisis stalling Montenegro’s economic progress. Nevertheless  with the implementation of our anti-crisis economic policy we have lessened the impact of the global crisis and stopped the downward trend in the Montenegrin economy.  That crisis confirmed the soundness of the basic principles of our economic policy — focusing on further stabilization of public finances  improving the business environment and structural reforms  so as to establish a stable  dynamic and competitive economy in the long term and to improve the quality of life of all citizens of Montenegro. Despite being fully aware that  if we are to mount an adequate response to the crisis  we will have to make some difficult and unpopular cuts in order to create a new  sound basis for strengthening the economy  we also know that actions taken by one stakeholder alone  no matter how successful  are insufficient. We all have to play a positive role in order to strike the right balance among success  sustainability  social responsibility and solidarity in this complex process.  Accordingly  we must not stop progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  the realization of which creates the basis for the further    11-51360 6  development of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. The fight against poverty and diseases  gender equality  protection of mothers and children  education  environmental protection and sustainable development represent the main prerequisites for progress and prosperity for our societies and are high on our Government’s agenda.  Montenegro supports pragmatic reform in the United Nations. As a small country  it is especially interested in strengthening the authority and role of the General Assembly — and other main United Nations bodies — and in improving its efficiency of operation. Increasing representation in the Security Council — including granting a seat to the Group of Eastern European States in the category of non-permanent member — would result in a functional strengthening of that body  improving its efficiency  accountability and credibility  in accordance with the United Nations Charter. A modern reform process  open to Member States individually or to groups of countries  must be based on a broad consensus on all five key aspects of Security Council reform. I am sure that there is a way to make a bridge between those goals and other entities  such as the Group of 20  for instance.  In its further democratization  its improved efficiency  its strengthened judiciary and administrative system  its fight against corruption and organized crime and its fostering of an inclusive society  Montenegro and the resident and non-resident United Nations agencies are working together to achieve the strategic goals of our common policy. The United Nations Development programme Resident Representative and the One United Nations programme have given an opportunity both to United Nations agencies and State partners in the process to create and monitor programme activities directly and on equal footing  and to adapt programme activities to the development needs of our country.  At the same time  the One United Nations programme is an opportunity for gradual reform in the operations of the United Nations system  creating a simultaneous and well-coordinated approach that will result  among other things  in avoiding overlaps between United Nations agencies and in achieving more efficient results in the implementation of national priorities.  Montenegro supports nuclear non-proliferation and objects to further expansion of the number of countries that possess nuclear weapons. Moreover  we support all agreements of the nuclear Powers on mutual reduction of their nuclear capacities  creating a safer world for existing and future generations. In that context  I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the appeal he sent late last month  requesting all countries that have nuclear technology to adhere to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I wish to emphasize that Montenegro ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions and that within less than a year it destroyed all reserves of that type of weapons  thus confirming again its commitment to the principles of non-proliferation.  Montenegro is an environmentally conscious State. That is a bedrock principle of our Constitution. Based on that commitment  we have an additional incentive to find solutions that are compatible with our sustainable development policy. Our strategy for development in Montenegro is to achieve synergy between growth and employment  on the one hand  and social equality  the environment and natural resources  on the other.   The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  which will take place in Rio de Janeiro in 2012  represents an important opportunity to promote international cooperation in the area of sustainable development and an opportunity to make a comprehensive evaluation of the progress made in the past two decades. Montenegro  as a member of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development from 2011 to 2014  is committed to contributing to the success of that Conference with its constructive actions.  Montenegro is especially sensitive to climate change issues. There are numerous potential negative effects of climate change on Montenegro. A rise in sea level and temperature would diminish biological diversity. I therefore believe that the fight against climate change requires a global  coordinated and decisive international agreement  based on the principles defined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. The Framework Convention represents a key multilateral forum for global action in the area of climate change  and the sixteenth Conference of the Parties in Cancún confirms that a multilateral approach to climate change management under United Nations auspices can give concrete results.   7 11-51360   Allow me to reiterate once again how honoured I am to participate in the general debate of this global forum on behalf of Montenegro and  together with the representatives of 192 countries  to contribute directly to the promotion of our mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence  to the benefit of all of our nations."
"119",4786,"MNG",66,2011,"My delegation offers President Al-Nasser its warm congratulations on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at the current session and pledges its unconditional support and cooperation in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities.  I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General on his well-deserved re-appointment and express my deep appreciation for his role in enhancing the role of the world Organization as a promoter of peace  security and development. His unanimous re-election to his high post is a testimony to his outstanding leadership of the United Nations over the past five years and a vote of strong confidence in his future endeavours.  On behalf of the people of Mongolia  I warmly welcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United Nations.  Today the international community finds itself in times of uncertainty. The recovery from the economic and financial crisis has been uneven and sluggish. Its social repercussions have been intensified by persistent unemployment and poverty in many countries. Major natural disasters occur all too often. Unprecedented challenges stemming from climate change continue and remain unaddressed.  The world’s population will reach 7 billion next month  and it is a cause of great concern that over a billion still suffer from hunger. The global economic and financial crisis grossly affected our drive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. A number of international negotiations and mediation efforts on conflict resolution have yet to produce results.  In today’s globalized world  these challenges require collective solutions. To this end  the existing governance structure ought to be improved and reformed. The involvement of international organizations is critical to this process. The thematic discussions on enhancing the role of the United Nations in global economic governance and dialogues with the Chairman of the Group of 20  held during the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  were the first important step. What we need to do now is to enhance the role and status of the United Nations  including the Economic and Security Council  in global economic decision-making.   19 11-50702   It has also become imperative to ensure full and on-time delivery of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to formulate the post-2015 development agenda. That agenda should help ensure the meaningful integration of developing countries into the world economy  taking into account the vulnerabilities of landlocked least-developed countries and those susceptible to desertification and climate change. The Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations  stalled for the past decade  has yet to produce positive results towards this end.  Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a landlocked developing country whose remoteness from world markets and high transport costs are a major impediment to its development. Along with other members of this group  Mongolia is endeavouring to advance our common interests at the United Nations and in the World Trade Organization. The creation of an international think tank for landlocked developing countries  to be set up in Ulaanbaatar  will unquestionably contribute to greater cooperation in the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and our relevant MDGs. I therefore call on all the relevant parties to sign and ratify the multilateral agreement establishing this institution  which will be vitally important to landlocked developing countries.  Last year  we reviewed our progress in achieving the MDGs and agreed to strengthen the partnership. Yet  as was shown in the most recent MDG Gap Task Force report  significant gaps remain in delivering on commitments in the areas of aid  trade  debt relief and access to new technologies. For Mongolia  66 percent of our MDGs are achievable by 2015. But our goals relating to poverty  environmental degradation and gender inequality are seriously off-track and will require stepped-up action on the part of the Government and the enhancement of our bilateral and multilateral partnerships if we are to meet these challenges.  Mongolia has been implementing targeted policies and activities aimed at poverty reduction. Alcoholism is one of the serious social ills associated with poverty. As President  I initiated a nationwide movement aimed at stopping alcohol abuse  curbing its consumption and encouraging abstinence that has enjoyed wide public support. With a view to encouraging such movements in other countries  it might be useful to look into the possibility of promulgating an international convention aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.  Climate change  drought  land degradation and desertification have emerged as some of the gravest challenges facing humankind. Yesterday’s High-level Meeting on desertification marked an important step forward in finding collective solutions to these challenges. It is a matter of great concern that 2 billion people and about 50 per cent of agricultural land around the globe are affected by desertification  land degradation and drought. We should therefore set up an intergovernmental panel to conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of these phenomena and to identify action-oriented recommendations for affected countries.  We look forward to the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Durban  South Africa  later this year  to discuss a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the development of green economies. I believe that the global transition to a green economy is critically important for mitigating climate change and halting desertification  land degradation  ecosystem destruction and the loss of biodiversity  and that these in turn will help reduce poverty.  Financial assistance and expertise are vital to developing countries  including my own  in their efforts to develop a green economy through the introduction of green technologies and by building national capacity in energy production  construction and agriculture. I trust that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development will produce results that can take us further down this road. As a country highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change  Mongolia is supportive of global efforts to combat its negative effects. With that in view  Mongolia will host the Asia-Europe Environment Ministers’ Meeting on Sustainable Water and Forest Management in 2012.  The past year has witnessed dramatic transformations. The Arab Spring has brought freedom to millions  but it is far from over. The revolution for freedom is not the hardest social change to make. Building and developing a free  open and fair civic society is even more difficult. That is what our ancestors taught us  and these lessons have been reinforced during our own democratic transformation    11-50702 20  over the past 20 years. Let me cite here the visionary teaching of the founder of the great Mongolian State  Chinggis Khaan  who was rightly chosen as the Man of the Millennium. Chinggis Khaan once said that conquering the world on horseback is easy; it is dismounting and governing that is much harder. The revolution for freedom is fought and won by the combined efforts of thousands of people. However  in one way or another  it is each and every person who pays the price for freedom. It is my firm belief that notwithstanding any challenges it faces  freedom is the future of all humankind.  Beginning in July  Mongolia assumed the honourable and responsible duties of President of the Community of Democracies  an organization geared to promoting and strengthening democratic norms and values around the world. During its presidency over the next two years  Mongolia will give priority to promoting education for democracy and good governance  eliminating corruption  building partnerships with civil society and consolidating regional cooperation.  Over the past 20 years of our own democratic changes  Mongolia has fundamentally transformed its former political  social and economic systems and laid down all the necessary foundations for new democratic governance  promoting and protecting a market economy  free elections  freedom of the press and civil society. We feel rightly proud of these accomplishments.  We are fully aware  however  that many things are far from perfect and that a lot more must be done to nurture democratic values in every citizen. Most of all  we must consolidate accountable and transparent governance  free from corruption and secured by an independent judiciary. Such governance should be more responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens  serve them  abide by the rule of law and the principle of impartiality  and have proper checks and balances. In short  we are striving to develop a system of governance that values its people and treats them with dignity and respect.  To address these challenges and threats to democracy and an open society  we are implementing a Mongolia-specific MDG 9 on democratic governance  human rights and zero tolerance for corruption. Within this goal  we are endeavouring to make our governance open and transparent; hence our full support for the Open Government Partnership initiative. I would also like to call on all Member States attempting to improve their governance at the national level to join the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Campaign.  The Arab Spring will be followed by the Arab Challenge. Although the democratic process is a homegrown phenomenon  it should be supported by international cooperation. Here  I have a message for the industrialized democratic countries: Do not withdraw from the battle. Democratization does not mean Westernization  however. Democracy should develop naturally  in line with the historical  cultural and development specifics of a given country. Nonetheless  respect for freedom  justice and human rights and strict observance of the rule of law are common to all successful and responsible democracies. Bad governance is the worst problem of all  and any aspirations to improve and streamline it should therefore be strongly supported at all times.  Libya has entered a new era as a result of the relentless courage and patience of the rebels  who persevered for many months in their struggle for freedom  human rights and democracy. Colonel Al-Qadhafi called his fellow countrymen “rats” who should be brutally hunted down and exterminated. Now he himself is being hunted like a rat from hole to hole and trench to trench. That is the fate that awaits anyone who represses people’s love for freedom and their desire to live in dignity. Respectful of the aspirations of the Libyan people  Mongolia has recognized the National Transitional Council and offers its full support to Libya’s transition towards democracy  justice and human rights.  The international community should not shy away from condemning the regime of Syria’s Bashar Al-Assad  who has inhumanly and brutally chosen the way of bloodshed to crack down on peaceful  freedom- and justice-craving protesters by using combat vehicles  snipers and military force. Let us unanimously demand that he end his atrocities. We must make the necessary decision to that effect without delay  and help the courageous people of Syria  who are losing dozens of their brave sons and daughters every day.  The love of freedom is the greatest force in this world. No tyranny  not even the cruellest regime  can resist it forever. I direct these words to the authorities   21 11-50702  of Yemen and dictators seeking to suppress their citizens’ fight for freedom.  It was a timely decision to make “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” the main theme of this general debate. The main purpose of the United Nations is to settle disputes by peaceful means. We commend the skilful diplomacy of the Secretary-General and his envoys in resolving disputes and conflicts in various corners of the world. Member States need to work together to strengthen the United Nations capacity to that end.  North-East Asia is a region where mediation activities can be vigorously pursued. The region still lacks a formal mechanism for building confidence and strengthening regional cooperation. Therefore  we believe that Mongolia’s proposal to set up a permanent mechanism to promote peace and stability in North-East Asia remains valid. We are ready to consult with relevant countries to move forward with out proposal.  On 11 September 10 years ago  terrorists tore down the twin towers  but they failed to tear down the spirit of freedom they represented  and they will never succeed in doing that. Mongolia stands with the international community in its fight against terrorism as a party to all of the United Nations conventions to combat terrorism.  We need to reinvigorate our resolve to attain a world free of nuclear weapons and to exploit nuclear power solely for peaceful purposes. We were reminded of the urgency and importance of strengthening the safety and security of nuclear reactors by the tragic accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant last March.  We commend the Secretary-General’s initiative to hold a high-level meeting tomorrow to strengthen international measures for nuclear safety and security around the world. The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons gave renewed impetus for expanding nuclear weapon-free zones around the world. The proposed nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East would contribute to the promotion of world peace.  Mongolia continues to work on further strengthening its internationally recognized nuclear weapon-free status. To this end  we are holding consultations with nuclear Powers. From the highly esteemed rostrum of the General Assembly  I would like to underscore that there should be no doubt that Mongolia will never accede to the dumping of nuclear waste on its territory. It should go without saying that  in today’s world  any attempt to enforce such decisions would undoubtedly fail.  It is of historic importance to us that the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of Mongolia’s joining this global Organization coincides with this session of the General Assembly. On 27 October 1961  Mongolia became a full Member of the United Nations. It has opened new frontiers of active engagement with the international community for the global good. Furthermore  this year Mongolia is marking the 2 220th anniversary of its statehood  centenaries of regaining its independence and the establishment of a modern diplomatic service  as well as the ninetieth anniversary of the people’s revolution.  Over the past five decades  cooperation between Mongolia and the United Nations has expanded both in scope and substance. Today Mongolia is a party to more than 240 multilateral conventions and enjoys membership in over 110 international organizations. United Nations assistance and cooperation have been instrumental in developing human resources and capacity-building  developing education  health and information technology  reducing poverty and developing an adequate response to natural disasters.  For its part  Mongolia has also endeavoured to contribute where it could to the joint efforts of the international community. My delegation is pleased to recall that  at the initiative of Mongolia  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Peoples to Peace  the principles and guidelines for international negotiations  resolutions on the annual observance of Disarmament Week  the United Nations Literacy Decade and resolutions relating to cooperatives  rural women and landlocked developing countries. Mongolian troops have courageously served in the blue United Nations helmet in many hotspots around the world  including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Western Sahara  South Sudan  Eritrea  Georgia  Sierra Leone  Chad and Darfur.  All in all  over the past five decades Mongolia has been faithful to its obligations under the Charter and striven to be an active Member State. We stand strongly committed to further contributing to the multifaceted activities of the United Nations. I am pleased to announce our decision to present our    11-50702 22  candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2023-2024 at the elections to be held at the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly  and humbly seek members’ valuable support.  The contribution and leadership of the United Nations in maintaining international peace  security and promoting sustainable development continue to grow. In this respect  I call on the General Assembly to develop relevant solutions and decisions at this session aimed at supporting the aspirations of countries and peoples to better livelihoods.  The day-to-day activities of the United Nations are of paramount importance to the cause of creating a safe  free and just life for humankind  in which everyone may enjoy integrity and dignity. We are confident that the United Nations will succeed in its continued reform efforts to this end."
"120",4827,"MOZ",66,2011,"We join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  of Qatar  on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His long diplomatic experience makes us anticipate that our deliberations will be crowned with success. We take this opportunity to assure him our full readiness to contribute to the success of this session  and wish him well in the discharge of his duties.  We extend our congratulations to the President’s predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss of the Swiss Confederation  on his commitment  pragmatism and dynamism in the conduct of the work of the sixty-fifth session.  We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to the post of Secretary-General  which demonstrates the recognition of Member States  and of the international community as a whole  of his commitment to the pursuit and consolidation of peace  security and international development. We are encouraged that  thanks to his full commitment  we will continue to work together  under the aegis of the United Nations  to find appropriate solutions to common problems facing humanity.  We welcome the newest Member of the United Nations  the Republic of South Sudan. With this sister country  we celebrated its independence and at that time expressed our congratulations on this important milestone.  This session takes place at a critical stage of human history  characterized in particular by the impact of the ongoing global financial and economic crisis; the rising prices of food and oil; the resurgence of hotbeds of tension and political instability  particularly in North Africa and the Middle East; the prevalence of pandemics such as malaria  tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS; and the increasing occurrence of natural disasters. These challenges require a multilateral approach in order to find consensual  effective and sustainable responses.  Indeed  the negative impact of these complex phenomena  especially in developing countries  is a potential factor of political and social instability. It is therefore necessary to focus on democratic principles grounded on dialogue  inclusive governance  accountability and transparency and respect for human rights.   9 11-50847   In this context  we commend the choice of theme for the session: the role and importance of mediation for the prevention of violent conflicts  for the pursuit of peaceful solutions and for the strengthening and consolidation of mutual trust. Those are key factors for building a solid and lasting peace.  We all yearn for a better world in which peace and security  harmony and concord reign  a world in which everyone’s concern is to combat poverty  fight against epidemics and promote the welfare and prosperity of humankind.  The proliferation of crises and the perpetuation of dissonant positions  rather than a search for solutions to the many problems that affect all humanity  make this dream become increasingly difficult to achieve. Therefore  strengthening multilateralism and global governance by the United Nations is of critical importance.  This session takes place in the year in which the United Nations family recalls the fiftieth anniversary of the physical disappearance of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. It is also 25 years since the assassination  by apartheid  of our late President Samora Moisés Machel. Those two personalities were lovers and defenders of peace  and they lost their lives when seeking peace for countries of our Mother Africa. In honour of those great names and all those who gave their lives to mediation and preventive diplomacy as a means for the peaceful settlement of disputes  let us all reaffirm our commitment to peace  and redouble our commitment in support of initiatives aimed at building a world free of conflict.  Mediation should be seen as an opportunity to bring together the parties to a dispute  reduce their differences and appeal to conscience so that together they can move towards mutually acceptable peaceful solutions. Mediation cannot be started with the assumption that we have all the answers; the mediation process should be conducted in an objective  impartial and neutral manner  ensuring the involvement of stakeholders at all stages and their ownership of the process. These are basic principles that ensure the continuity and consolidation of the process of national reconciliation and reconstruction  and  more important  the building of mutual trust.  Aware of these principles  Mozambique is proud to be part of some positive experiences in different mediation processes in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole. We have thus contributed to helping other countries to return to the path leading to social and economic development. We therefore appeal for appreciation of the mediation role of the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations.  The universality of the United Nations gives it a key role in promoting international peace and security by resorting to peaceful means to settle disputes. In this sense  the Organization is once again called upon to assume the responsibility entrusted to it in the Charter as a facilitator of mediation within the concert of nations  through its organs  in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly  as well as through the Peacebuilding Commission.  We praise the progress made by the United Nations  whose impact on prevention  mitigation and mediation of internal and inter-State conflicts has been positive. These achievements can be consolidated by strengthening the relationship between the principal organs of the United Nations with a mandate to safeguard international peace and security  as well as their relationship with regional and subregional organizations.  We reaffirm our recognition of the role of the regional and subregional organizations as pillars in the promotion and maintenance of peace  security and stability through the use of preventive diplomacy and early warning systems.  The African experience has proved that the various regional and subregional mediation initiatives have been effective in preventing and managing conflicts and tensions  and in maintaining regional peace and stability. In this context  we salute the signature of the political road map leading to the return to constitutional order in Madagascar  the culmination of a negotiating process  mediated by the Southern African Development Community  which started in August 2009.  The United Nations remains the appropriate forum for addressing current challenges  including the peaceful resolution of disputes. However  in order to assume its role effectively  our Organization must complete the ongoing reforms.   In this sense  we reiterate the commitment of the Republic of Mozambique to continue to provide relevant input to the reform process  which helps the United Nations to become more proactive and effective    11-50847 10  in dealing with global issues  thus contributing to the consolidation of its credibility and legitimacy  in the interests of the peoples of the world. In this regard  we reiterate our interest in seeing the conclusion of the process of revitalization of the role and authority of the General Assembly as a more representative and legitimate body of the United Nations.   It is in this Assembly  where we are all represented and where every vote counts  that the most important decisions on the international agenda  including the peaceful and negotiated settlement of disputes  should be taken and evaluated. Only a strong General Assembly  endowed with the necessary authority and competence and adequate resources  would be up to these responsibilities and current challenges.  Another important component of reform that continues to deserve our attention is the Security Council. This body should  in a transparent  inclusive and democratic manner  follow the evolution and dynamics of contemporary global challenges and assume its vital role in building the credibility of the United Nations as a universal entity. We are confident that these reforms will allow greater dialogue and cooperation between the General Assembly and the Security Council  strengthening the relationship with each other and with relevant regional and subregional organizations.  We have been following with due attention the social and political developments in North Africa and the Middle East. We recognize that these developments pose a challenge for the countries and regions concerned and also for the international community. We are hopeful that the processes in progress will capitalize on opportunities to promote peace  expand freedoms  promote development and improve living conditions. We call upon all relevant actors to engage in constructive dialogue and work for peaceful solutions to ensure peace and stability.  From those developments we have learned the lesson that internal dialogue  regional cooperation  and fairness in the interventions of the United Nations should be privileged.  We note with concern the lack of progress in the Israeli-Arab peace process. In this context  we urge the parties to commit themselves to relaunching negotiations that are translated into concrete actions with a view to a lasting  comprehensive and fair conflict solution. We reiterate our unequivocal support for the cause of the Palestinian people  who have been denied the inalienable right to self-determination.  We reaffirm our support for the principle of the creation of two States  Palestine and Israel  coexisting peacefully and in accordance with the 1967 borders. We also reiterate our support for the commitment of the international community to finding a sustainable solution in favour of the people of Western Sahara. We also reiterate our support for their legitimate right to self-determination.  We take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the brotherly peoples of Somalia  Ethiopia and Kenya  plagued by severe drought and famine. We praise the efforts that the international community has made so far to alleviate the suffering and loss of life.   Finally  we reaffirm the continued engagement and commitment of the Republic of Mozambique to peace  security and stability."
"121",4873,"MRT",66,2011,"It is my honour and pleasure at the outset of this brief statement to welcome and congratulate the Republic of South Sudan upon its accession to membership in the United Nations and for its participation for the first time in the work of the General Assembly.  I am also happy to warmly congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Allow me to express our full confidence in him as he undertakes the exceptional efforts required to strengthen the progress achieved to date in terms of international peace and security  taking into account the need to preserve the well-being  stability and progress of our world. I pay tribute to the effectiveness of Qatari diplomacy and its important role in strengthening international peace and security.   I also pay tribute to the valuable efforts made by Mr. Al-Nasser’s predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  who upheld the principles of dialogue and consultation in order to reach the best solutions on international issues. I also warmly congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to head the Organization and wish him full success. I commend his persistent Herculean efforts to resolve many issues  including strengthening international peace and security  achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  combating climate change and mitigating the threats of famine and endemic disease  as well as all of the challenges that hinder the well-being of humanity.  The sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a sensitive political juncture in our region. The popular uprisings in many Arab countries have led to revolutions calling for democracy  justice  freedom and decent living conditions. My country was at the forefront of meeting these demands and aspirations. Over the past few years  we have experienced radical change in the form of a peaceful and flexible transition from a totalitarian regime that had suppressed freedoms and emptied the public coffers to a democratic system and credible institutions that have consolidated the rule of law and guaranteed individual and collective freedoms and the rights of all sectors of Mauritanian society  based on justice and the rule of law.  Those measures have included the organization of free  fair and transparent presidential elections that were monitored by international observers and even endorsed by their opponents. Our country has also    11-51670 2  begun enjoying a sincere political openness at all levels of society. A few days ago  we launched a genuine national political dialogue open to all of the country’s political parties. In addition  media airwaves have been freed and licences issued to 10 radio and television stations to begin broadcasting in the near future.  In the context of good governance  my country has enshrined transparency in its administration and its strengthened and independent judiciary. We have achieved remarkable levels of growth through ambitious programmes to improve our population’s standard of living. These programmes focus first and foremost on the most vulnerable sectors of society — low-income citizens and those living in poor neighbourhoods and isolated rural areas — allowing my country to achieve a stable domestic situation that will in turn foster efforts in our young  effective diplomacy.   We are a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council and chair the Good Offices Commission  established to bring together opposition parties in Libya and Côte d’Ivoire. We are fully convinced that dialogue and mediation are the best ways to resolve conflict and address crises  as indicated in the theme of the general debate of this sixty-sixth session.  Since the election of His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as President  we have endeavoured to strengthen our presence within regional and international organizations  including the United Nations and its various specialized bodies  the Arab Maghreb Union  the League of Arab States  the African Union  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned Movement  to name a few. We have also joined regional African and Caribbean groups to show support for their systems and decisions and as part of our strategy to broaden our principled foreign policy.  In that context  we reiterate our support for efforts to reform the United Nations and its various bodies  including the Security Council. We ask that Africa be given permanent representation  as it is the only continent that has lacked a permanent seat on the Security Council since the establishment of the United Nations. Our continent has 1 billion inhabitants and hosts more than two-thirds of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We also call for permanent representation for the Group of Arab States  whose population makes up more than 11 per cent of the world’s inhabitants.   Consultations on Security Council reform have been ongoing for many years  and we call for continued consultations in order to achieve a comprehensive platform  supported unanimously by Member States  for reform of the United Nations and its working methods and decision-making processes. In that regard  my country believes that we should begin with the make-up of the Security Council  the definition of its competence and responsibilities  and institutional relations between the Council and the General Assembly in order to ensure the Organization’s effectiveness and to fairly and accurately reflect  in a balanced manner  the will of the entire international community.   In that context  I remind the Assembly that Mauritania is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the biennium 2012-2013  representing the Group of African States. Support for our candidacy was expressed by our continental organization  the African Union  at its Addis Ababa summit in January and Malabo summit in June. It also supports our conviction and profound belief in the mission and principles of the United Nations and our sincere will to effectively contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security  play a positive role in the Security Council  and assume greater responsibilities in order to attain the noble objectives for which this Organization was created.  I note that Mauritania has adopted a policy of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourly relations with the countries of its region. It is not party to any conflict and enjoys excellent and friendly relations with all countries of the world. I take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of the friendly  kindred States that have supported our candidacy.  We note with deep satisfaction the gargantuan efforts made during the sixty-fifth session  including the High-level Meeting on Youth and the High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs and the need to implement them. Nevertheless  we note and deplore the fact that the populations of most States continue to live in dire economic conditions that are not conducive to the achievement of the MDGs.   In that context  allow me to recall the steep rise in unemployment  especially among young people; the increased rate of abject poverty  especially in the most   3 11-51670  vulnerable sectors of society; the decelerated growth in gross domestic product; the global recession; decreased official foreign investment  especially in Africa; the volatility of basic commodity prices  which has had devastating effects on the buying power of large sectors of the populations of developing countries; reduced net transfers to developing countries; decreased tourist revenue; increased maternal and newborn death rates; and the increased debt burden.  This latter issue is already a terrible economic burden on developing countries  and leads to the emptying of public coffers that are modest to begin with  especially in the light of their infrastructure and public service needs. In such economic conditions  the economies of the least developed countries face many enormous obstacles  making it increasingly difficult to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. As we approach the deadline for achieving the MDGs  many developing countries remain far from doing so.   We call on wealthy developed States to contribute  in accordance with their promises  to the revival of these least developed countries so that they can provide acceptable levels of public services and guarantee civil peace  security and stability  and to strengthen the social fabric of these countries  which in turn will contribute to international peace and security.  Non-communicable diseases are another important public health issue. The extent of the spread of these diseases is truly catastrophic  and mortality rates are higher than those of all other diseases. Furthermore  their effects on health and the social and economic fields are a further obstacle to the attainment of the MDGs  especially Goals 4 and 5 relative to maternal and child health  which are closely linked to non-communicable diseases. This is especially true because malnutrition in pregnancy and early childhood is the source of hypertension and diabetes later in life.   This is why I note with satisfaction that my country has risen to the challenge posed by these diseases by establishing extensive health infrastructure and strengthening the human resources available to deal with such diseases. We have also built a specialized oncology hospital with the latest technology  a modern hospital for cardiovascular disease  a diabetes treatment centre and over 50 dialysis centres. All of these have been established in record time  less than two years since the accession to power of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz following the presidential elections of 18 July 2009.   Our country is closely following the situation in the Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to reach a comprehensive  lasting and just solution that enjoys the support of both countries  in order to strengthen peace and security in the area and to create an Arab Maghreb that is open to progress and development and responds to the aspirations of its peoples. This is a strategic option for my country.  I believe that the Israeli-Arab conflict is a source of tension and a threat to peace and security in a sensitive and vital region of the world. My country supports efforts for peace that will guarantee the recovery of all the rights of the Palestinian people and the creation of an independent Palestinian State within the 4 June 1967 borders  with its capital in Jerusalem  coexisting in peace and security with the State of Israel.   This is why the Islamic Republic of Mauritania calls on the international community to recognize Palestine as an independent sovereign State and to facilitate its full membership of the United Nations on the basis of the request made last week by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas  Executive Secretary of the Palestine Liberation Organization and President of the Palestinian Authority. We must be faithful to the historic responsibilities of the international community towards Palestine; uphold justice  credibility and fairness with regard to this question; and ensure respect for the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy. We condemn the ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip and the acts committed by the Israeli military machine  killing civilians and destroying Palestinian facilities.   We call for concerted Arab  regional and international efforts to assist our Libyan brothers and sisters. We seek an end to the killings and a response to the legitimate aspirations to reform and change of our kindred people of Libya in order to guarantee their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We call on the international community to support the Libyan people and provide for all their needs in various areas so as to ensure the success of the transitional phase.   We also call on the international community to intensify and accelerate the international response to the tragic humanitarian situation resulting from the acute drought in the Horn of Africa. Speedy assistance    11-51670 4  must be provided to the hundreds of thousands of Somalis citizens who have been forced to become refugees and are enduring tragic living and security conditions. Although our means are modest  we have provided assistance in the amount of $1 million to support the efforts of the African Union on behalf of the people of Somalia.   For many years now  our region  the African Sahel  has been the stage for the expansion of organized crime networks that traffic in drugs  weapons  ammunition and human beings  and are responsible for illegal migration flows across the area  kidnappings  abductions and terrorism. They pose a real threat to the peace and stability of our region.   We are convinced that there is a direct and close relationship between peace  development and democracy. For this reason  we believe that peace and security are preconditions to achieving development and democracy and to strengthening the rule of law institutions. We have adopted laws  prepared plans and taken steps to guarantee peace  security and safety for our citizens and foreign citizens living legally in Mauritania. Our security system has responded firmly and courageously to the threats of criminal terrorist groups against our security and that of our guests. We have succeeded in guaranteeing peace within our borders and security at border points  as attested to by all. We work in full understanding and coordination with Algeria  Mali and Niger to suppress the activities and free movement of these criminal terrorist groups.  The culture of peace  the ideals of tolerance among nations and civilizations  and upholding justice and law among peoples are the best ways to advance on the road to peace and security in our world. However  when issues remain pending for years; when there is a growing gap between rich and poor; when international economic institutions are fragile and weak; and when justice  fairness and equality are so slow to be provided  tensions will increase and extremism and terrorism spread. We in Mauritania reject terrorism in every form  and we adhere to the peaceful principles of Islam — principles of tolerance and brotherhood that reject violence and extremism. We believe that the international community should consider seriously why terrorism exists and root it out vigorously.  The international community must honour the commitments it has made since the Organization was established  but it can do so only if all the States and peoples of the world are able to benefit from available potential and resources and if development efforts in developing countries are supported so that people can live in dignity  freedom and equality. That is the only way we can achieve the noble goals that this Organization set for itself when it was created."
"122",4919,"MUS",66,2011,"The primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace and security  as set out in the very first Article of its Charter. This remains the top priority of the international community and of the United Nations.  However  66 years after the adoption of the Charter  our definition of peace and security differs from what it was in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Our concerns today are wider than the mere suppression of aggression or similar breaches of peace. We are now equally concerned about the threats to peace and security resulting from factors other than armed aggression. Tensions exist  within nations and among nations  as a result of unequal access to resources  the lack of food security  or existential threats because of the inability to address climate change issues. Insecurity also results from the absence of an adequate international mechanism for the redress of grievances and the peaceful settlement of disputes.  I propose to deal with four of the constitutive elements of present-day security that the international community and the United Nations should address     11-51360 24  namely  the elements of economic  environmental  human and legal security.  When peoples and nations feel inextricably mired in poverty and face bleak prospects for development  they are insecure about their future. That economic insecurity may ultimately threaten global peace. The current economic turmoil is deepening the despair of those who live in need and is spreading despondency  even in relatively affluent countries. The world economy has yet to recover from the crisis of 2008.  Today  Europe and North America struggle with budget deficits  unsustainable debts and high unemployment. At the same time  the recent political turmoil across the Middle East could mean that oil and food prices will continue to rise. As developed economies grapple with these serious challenges  the developing world finds itself negatively impacted by economic and financial crises resulting from failures in which it had absolutely no part.  While the ability of established developed countries to deal with economic and financial problems is in question  the world is witnessing the rapid rise of a number of emerging economies. As the economic centre of gravity shifts eastward and creates new opportunities  we must ensure that those formidable global challenges do not create economic insecurity for those who feel left behind and that they do not lead to other threats to international security.  It is imperative that we manage these transformations judiciously and with pragmatism. In that context  I must stress the particular economic vulnerabilities of small island developing States (SIDS). The economies of SIDS remain highly volatile because of their open economies  small economic size  narrow resource base  disadvantages in economies of scale  high export concentration  dependency on imports and high vulnerability to energy- and food-price shocks.  We reiterate that SIDS need to be granted preferential treatment as part of a global strategy to ensure economic security. Regrettably  SIDS have been denied the formal recognition of their specific vulnerabilities that would entitle them to special consideration. My delegation fully supports the implementation of the Barbados Plan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  As there are increasing concerns over issues such as employment  food security  climate change and access to water  it is a matter of regret that trade talks that could give a boost to international trade  and therefore to economic security  are stalled.  On a broader note  I must say that talks on trade and other economic issues  to the extent that they take place at all  are held in sectoral and often restricted forums. While the specialized nature of these negotiations  or of the scope of the matters being addressed by standard-setting organizations  may require dedicated sectoral frameworks  it is imperative that the international community ensures that those frameworks are legitimate ones  with universal membership. It is also imperative that  as an apex body  the United Nations have a holistic view on global economic  financial  trade and development issues.  During the 1970s  the United Nations played a significant role in shaping the conceptual framework for a new international economic order. The United Nations has adopted a number of landmark resolutions that have laid the normative foundation for a more equitable economic order. The United Nations still has a role to play in shaping the world economic order to ensure economic security  in accordance with its mandate under the Charter. The United Nations is the only international organization with not just the necessary legitimacy and universality but also the responsibility to have an overview of global economic development. In doing so  the United Nations will ensure policy coordination among forums for various sectors  set principles and guidelines for sector-specific negotiations  and assume its ultimate responsibility for the economic security of all nations.  To reaffirm its responsibility with respect to economic security  the United Nations must not only undergo reforms in its institutions and working methods  it must also re-balance its focus on political and economic issues. In this regard  the Economic and Social Council must be given the prominence it was intended to have as one of the principal organs of the United Nations. And in assuming its responsibility with respect to economic security  a reformed and revitalized United Nations will have to work more closely with regional cooperative institutions  which are the pillars of international cooperation.  The high food prices of 2007 and 2008 and the global economic crisis led millions of people into food   25 11-51360  insecurity and raised the total number of people who go hungry to more than 1 billion. Commodity prices remain high and the risk of repeated crises is real. With the projected increase in world population to 9.1 billion by 2050  and the rising costs of production  there is a risk of persistent price volatility. That will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The international community must therefore seriously address the issue of food insecurity around the world.   Economic security also entails working towards a more inclusive national society without discrimination  eliminating inequalities and fostering wider participation on the part of all sections of the community in national development and governance.  Two days ago  at our 14th meeting  we gathered to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. We welcome the progress achieved in the fight against racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance since 2001. We nonetheless recognize that in spite of these efforts  many people continue to be victims of these despicable practices.  We commend the United Nations on the success of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on Youth (see A/65/PVs.111 and 112) and the adoption of the outcome document (resolution 65/312). Development and security will require greater participation by young people in the formulation of strategies and policies.   In that same spirit  we welcome the establishment of UN-Women and its overarching vision of a world in which societies are free of gender-based discrimination and where women and men have equal opportunities  respect and consideration. A more inclusive world  where women’s intellectual and economic potential is fully realized  will promote economic security.  In June of next year  world leaders will meet in Rio de Janeiro to renew their political commitment to sustainable development and  hopefully  to adopt concrete measures that will contribute to greater economic security. But before we can move ahead  we will also have to consider why so many past commitments have not been honoured. We look forward to the oceans receiving the attention that they deserve at Rio  as part of the broader economic agenda. Small island States in particular are relying on the international community to give due attention to the sustainability of the oceans in the context of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and beyond. The sustainability of oceans is crucial to the security and  in some cases  the very survival of many small island States.  Humanity as a whole is now increasingly concerned about its environmental security  probably more than it has ever been in its history. For some small island nations  this concern is  in fact  an existential one. In recent decades the United Nations has brought to the fore the concept of sustainable development and the measures required to promote such development. The preparatory work under way for Rio+20 has highlighted the serious gaps we still face in this area. The disruptions resulting from climate change pose a real threat to global security.  Climate change is real. Extreme weather phenomena such as super-storms  floods  droughts and heat-waves are already upon us. Climate change is affecting us in our daily life  and it threatens the very survival of many small islands. Mauritius is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Air temperature has risen by 0.6° to 1.1°C in different microclimates over recent decades. The sea level is rising at the rate of 1.2 millimetres per year in the south-west Indian Ocean. Our annual rainfall has decreased by 8 per cent compared to the 1950s. Extreme weather conditions such as flooding are becoming more frequent.  Without international cooperation and concerted action  the impact of climate change will be devastating for all our nations. My delegation firmly believes that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international  intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. Small island nations are economically vulnerable  and their vulnerability is exacerbated by the dramatic consequences of climate change. Small island States rely on the international community for their security.  Mauritius is committed to the concept of the green economy. We recognize that it is not a one-size-fits-all notion. Countries need to reflect their own national priorities and realities in their implementation of it.   My Government has been pursuing a sustainable development strategy. The Maurice Ile Durable project  which we adopted in 2008  is taking shape  and a whole range of measures have already been    11-51360 26  implemented. We propose to increase the share of renewable energy in the generation of power from the present 18 per cent to 35 per cent by 2025  by making more intensive use of biofuels and wave  solar and wind energy. To that end in May last year I set up a full-fledged ministry with responsibility for sustainable development. We are engaged in a national consultation process to formulate strategies and policies that have public support and are designed to protect the environment  deliver social justice and create a sustainable economy.  Climate has impacted the water cycle both directly and indirectly  and will continue to do so  by affecting precipitation and evaporation cycles as well as water availability and patterns of water consumption. Many regions of the world are already experiencing reduced rainfall. As climate change intensifies and water scarcity becomes more acute  the threat of tensions among different nations and different users may increase. The international community must therefore work together to address this pressing issue. Environmental security must be a priority of the United Nations in promoting global security.  As well as dealing with the existential threat that climate change poses for some nations  people around the world continue to be concerned about their own security. I will mention four such concerns.   Disarmament is a major component of international security strategy. The threat to humanity posed by the continued existence of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is a universal concern. Our failure to resolve the issue of disarmament continues to undermine global development and security. A significant reduction in the production of conventional weapons and eventually a world free of nuclear weapons are goals that will be achieved only over time  and that will require patience and perseverance. As a matter of fact  the international political environment is now probably more conducive to the realization of these goals than it has ever been.  Terrorism continues to be a threat to security. Recent events have reminded us that acts of terrorism can be perpetrated by extremists from all points on the political spectrum  and that terrorism is equally capable of breeding in both poor and rich countries. The international community needs to follow up on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and enhance international cooperation in that regard.  The World Drug Report 2011 again shows that drug trafficking and consumption remain significant. Narco-trafficking and drug money in organized crime and terrorist activities are a threat to stability and security at the national and regional levels. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs  let us recommit our efforts to fight drug trafficking as part of the global strategy to ensure human security.  We are 30 years into the fight against HIV/AIDS  which is an ever-present threat to human security. I am convinced that we have achieved more in the 10 years since the special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS than we did in the previous two decades. It is heartening that the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS held in June renewed the political commitment of Governments to halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS and to ensuring that  by 2015  no child is born with HIV (see resolution 65/277  annex).  Mauritius fully adheres to the UNAIDS vision of uniting for universal access. The National AIDS Secretariat  which I set up in May 2007  pursues its work to achieve zero new infections  zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in Mauritius.  Article 2 of the United Nations Charter provides that all Members shall settle their disputes by peaceful means. Article 33 spells out the means and ways of doing so. In the same spirit  the Charter provides in Chapter XIV for the establishment of the International Court of Justice.  However  recourse to international adjudication for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States has  historically  required the consent of the States concerned. In recent times  a number of bilateral or multilateral agreements have provided for the prior commitment of States to submit to arbitration or adjudication. We welcome that development.  Security requires the appropriate legal framework for the redress of grievances or the settlement of disputes. The international community has yet to set up adequate machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes that is available to all States.  The General Assembly has decided to convene a high-level meeting during the sixty-seventh session on the rule of law. We welcome that decision  but we want   27 11-51360  to stress that the debate on the rule of law must apply at both the national and international level. We would therefore look forward to the Assembly discussing the rule of law as it applies to inter-State relations as part of the forthcoming debates.  Allow me to give as an example the difficulties that my own country has experienced in resolving a dispute with the former colonial Power  the United Kingdom  relating to decolonization. The Chagos Archipelago  which is part of Mauritian territory  was excised from Mauritius prior to independence  in total disregard of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX) and the principles of international law  and was declared the so-called British Indian Ocean Territory. The United Kingdom has failed to engage in any meaningful discussions with us on the matter.  When the Government of Mauritius consequently announced in 2004 that it would refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice  the United Kingdom immediately amended its declaration  under Article 36 of the Court’s Statute  to reject the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to certain disputes with a member or former member of the Commonwealth. That illustrates the kind of difficulties that a State may face in settling a claim under international law. The States involved in the dispute may refuse to negotiate in good faith and seek to ensure that no international tribunal can determine the law applicable to the dispute.   We call on the United Nations to keep under review the whole issue of the settlement of disputes  including by judicial means  and to set standards of conduct for all States with respect to negotiation  conciliation  mediation or other forms of non-judicial and peaceful settlement of disputes or  alternatively  to the submission of the dispute to adjudication.  In that context  Mauritius is particularly pleased to welcome the decision of the President of the General Assembly to adopt as the theme of its current session the role of mediation in settling international disputes. We affirm our full support in advancing that cause.  Greater legal security also requires better global governance. In that respect  the United Nations must lead by example. The United Nations must recognize that the world has changed since 1945. Current efforts to adopt reforms in relation to the Security Council  the revitalization of the General Assembly and the working methods of our Organization must be given the sincere and strong support that is required.  My delegation continues to believe that comprehensive reform of the Security Council should include reform in the membership of both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. Africa should no longer be deprived of its right to permanent representation on the Council. My delegation fully supports the African common position enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.  We equally believe that Latin America also fully deserves permanent representation on the Council. Mauritius further reiterates its support for India’s rightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.  We also look forward to a more all-inclusive United Nations system that can effectively address issues of international security  with the admission of Palestine as a Member State. The United Nations and the international community have a duty to restore to the Palestinian people their dignity and their right to statehood and security. Mauritius supports the application for full membership of the United Nations  submitted to the Secretary-General yesterday by the President of the State of Palestine (A/66/371  annex)  and the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to take their rightful place in the international community. We welcome the statement by President Abbas at the 19th meeting that Palestine extends its hands to the Israeli Government and the Israeli people for peacemaking and for building cooperative relations between the States of Palestine and Israel.  We are also pleased to welcome the emergence of South Sudan as an independent and a sovereign State and its admission to the United Nations.  Before I conclude  I wish to say a few words about matters of interest to our region.  As a coastal State of the Indian Ocean  Mauritius is concerned by piracy  which poses a threat to global commerce. It hinders economic development and has become a major security issue in the region and beyond. We welcome the response of the international community to that serious threat. Cognizant of the problems that arise in connection with the prosecution and detention of pirates  Mauritius has offered to assist with the prosecution and detention of pirates. Mauritius and the European Union signed an agreement in July this year to enhance our capacity to contribute to the international effort under way in that regard.    11-51360 28   If the international response to the famine in Somalia is not commensurate with the immense and immediate needs of the people  we fear that the problem of piracy will only worsen.  The continued unlawful occupation of the Chagos Archipelago by the United Kingdom is a matter of concern for the region. Mauritius welcomes the support of the African Union and of the Non-Aligned Movement for the territorial integrity of our country. The purported declaration of a marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago by the United Kingdom  in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  is another cause for concern. That is why  in December of last year  Mauritius commenced arbitration proceedings against the United Kingdom under the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.  As regards Tromelin  Mauritius and France made progress with an agreement on joint management  without prejudice to our sovereignty. However  we need to continue our dialogue for at the end of the day  the territorial integrity of Mauritius will not be complete without the return of Tromelin.  As a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and current Chair of the Indian Ocean Commission  Mauritius welcomes the signing last week of an agreement between leading stakeholders on a road map for the restoration of democracy in our neighbouring State of Madagascar. That agreement was reached following the relentless efforts of SADC and the Indian Ocean Commission to bring the parties together. Implementation of the road map requires the holding of national and local elections  for which significant resources need to be mobilized. We call on the United Nations and the international community to extend all their support for the successful implementation of the road map. (spoke in French)  The lack of security on the economic  environmental  legal or even  in some cases  existential fronts calls for a review of the mandated obligations of the United Nations. While the initial concerns of the founding fathers about threats to international security remain valid  the international community today is just as concerned by other threats to its security and other challenges to be tackled.  I would add that  in updating this concept of security and  by extension  in redefining the role of the United Nations  the international community must also foster dialogue among cultures and civilizations. We welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to create the Alliance of Civilizations  whose mission is to improve understanding and relations among nations and peoples of different cultures and religions and to assist efforts to halt the forces that fuel divisions and extremism.   Tensions are often caused by ignorance  by fear of others and by feelings of justice denied. Thus it is crucial not only to maintain dialogue among nations and peoples  but also to promote the understanding of cultures and civilizations."
"123",4956,"MWI",66,2011,"First of all  let me say how pleased I am to come before the General Assembly and to address it on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika  President of the Republic of Malawi. The President was unable to attend due to other State commitments  but he sends his greetings to you  Sir  the Secretary-General and all the peoples of the United Nations.   At the outset  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. Your election is a manifestation of the confidence that the people of the United Nations have in your leadership. I wish you well as you lead this body in the next several months.  Allow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss  the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session  for his effective leadership during his tenure. I had the opportunity of working with him in Istanbul  and he was very helpful to me personally as a new participant in those international activities. He also showed much interest in Africa. I hope that  whatever he does in future  he will continue to show interest in Africa.   Let me also take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous reappointment as Secretary-General. His endorsement has demonstrated the international community’s confidence in his leadership. I remember his visit to Malawi this past year  when he came to visit the Millennium Village. The people of Mwandama village anxiously await his return  and they have sent word through me to ask him  whenever he has time  to come back to Malawi.   Let me take this opportunity to join other speakers in congratulating our brothers and sisters of South Sudan for achieving their independence. I am particularly excited about this because  when South Sudan gained its independence  Malawi was Chair of the African Union and played a small part in its emergence as an independent State. I am very excited about that. The emergence of South Sudan is  I believe  a good manifestation of the importance of mediation and negotiation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. There is no question in my mind that the remaining issues that exist between South Sudan and the Sudan will also be resolved in a peaceful manner. I therefore wish them well.  The theme of this general debate is “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. I consider this an opportune time to discuss that particular issue because today we are faced with new problems  including inter-State and intra-State problems. There is a new phenomenon of people who become divided over ethnic  linguistic  religious or cultural differences within States. Methods must therefore be found to resolve disputes within States.  I therefore wish to commend the United Nations and to encourage the establishment of durable mechanisms to ensure that disputes between and within States are resolved in a peaceful manner. In that context  I congratulate the African Union  regional organizations and other international organizations for the mediation work they have done  especially in Africa. I would like to encourage developing countries  especially African States  to make sure to adopt the practice of resolving disputes in universities and to train people at regional and local levels in dispute settlement and resolution techniques.  There are a number of issues facing the United Nations and the world  but my country has identified five that I hope will be put at the forefront of the United Nations agenda at this and future sessions. The first issue is that of disaster relief and management. Disasters have now become a major problem in most of our countries. They strain the resources of the least developed countries  particularly in Africa. We face problems of floods  heavy rains  droughts  earthquakes  heavy winds and hurricanes almost every day. Such developments have the effect of turning back the progress made with respect to the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore  I would like to invite the international community to set up mechanisms in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world that can assist us in managing disasters.  My country also attaches importance to the issue of climate change. Climate change has become an extremely difficult issue in Africa  where crops are destroyed because there is either too much rain or too little rain  too much wind or too much sunshine. All these possibilities are due to climate change. Therefore  I encourage the international community to come up with mechanisms to manage climate change. I know that countries like Malawi have not contributed to the    11-51670 34  incidence of climate change. Nevertheless  we feel we do have a collective responsibility to make sure that the issue of climate change is addressed. I hope that the upcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  scheduled to take place in South Africa  will address this particular problem.   The third area to which my country attaches importance is the issue of peace and security. As we are all aware  no matter how much development we achieve  it will be meaningless if there is no peace and security in our countries. Unfortunately  in our countries  especially in Africa  we now face a lot of challenges. There are movements of people who are bent upon bringing about unconstitutional changes of Government  thereby causing instability.   In the case of Malawi  we are committed to maintaining peace and security. We are also committed to democracy and good governance. In this regard  Malawi has  for example  instituted a number of bodies  such as the Malawi Human Rights Commission  an ombudsman  an anti-corruption bureau and the Department of the Auditor General. All these institutions are institutions of good governance aimed at improving the governance in our part of Africa  and certainly in Malawi.   Another issue that is of importance to Malawi in particular and to Africa in general is the issue of self-determination. We still have over 2 million people in different parts of the world living under colonial domination. I want to urge the international community to make sure that by the end of the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism — from 2011 to 2021 — all the territories under colonial domination will be free and independent. I think that self-governance is a very important concept. The self-determination of colonized peoples is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.   Of course  there is another element of self-determination which the United Nations obviously has to address  namely  that of self-determination outside the colonial context. It is an extremely complicated problem that needs to be addressed and studied. First of all  what does self-determination mean within the context of non-colonial States? What are peoples within the context of non-colonial States? It is an issue that obviously we must address because it is an important one.  Finally  my Government attaches great importance to the role of the Security Council. There is no question that the Council has played an extremely important role since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. However  I think it is obvious to everybody that the structure created in 1945 is no longer applicable to the present situation. We need therefore to make sure that the Security Council is democratized. We need to make sure that majority of countries  especially those most affected by the Security Council  like Malawi and others in Africa  are given a role to play in the Council. I therefore would like to endorse Africa’s common position  known as the Ezulwini Consensus  that two permanent member seats and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council should be given to Africa."
"124",5002,"MYS",66,2011,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I have no doubt that  under your able leadership  the Assembly will be able to complete its   31 11-51670  deliberations and proceedings successfully. In that respect  I wish to assure you of Malaysia’s full support for your presidency. Permit me also to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General.  The theme you have chosen for the general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is apt  fitting and timely. Indeed  the United Nations itself was established as an instrument of mediation to promote peace  security and stability among the nations of the world. Many in this body have spoken about the importance of settling disputes through mediation. Malaysia shares that view.  In the final analysis  peace can be achieved only if people are willing to engage in mediation. Now  more than ever before  mediation must be made to work in the Middle East crisis  as it is the only option available for the achievement of lasting peace.  Year after year after year  we have hoped for a peaceful and just resolution of the Palestinian issue. In the time that we have spent hoping  we have also come to realize that mediation is the only means of providing a sustainable resolution to all conflicts and crises. As such  all of us have a role to play in ensuring that it is effective. Patience and prudence have their merits  but patience and prudence must not result in paralysis. This body and the Security Council have adopted numerous resolutions on Palestine  yet there has been no tangible outcome.   We support the application of the Palestinians to the United Nations and welcome the readiness of both parties to hold talks on the basis of the existing international legal framework. In that connection  Malaysia fully supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to an independent State of Palestine  based on the two-State solution  taking into account the security concerns of both parties.  For some time now  our world has been battered by unprecedented political challenges  devastating national calamities and financial crises. During that time  our institutions and mechanisms have seemed incapable of handling these challenges and the pace at which they surface. To compound the situation  while we address long-standing causes of international instability  non-traditional threats to peace and security  such as terrorism  pose additional challenges.   As we share the grief of those who lost their loved ones in the 9/11 attack 10 years ago  we must strengthen our resolve to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. That can be achieved only by addressing the root causes of terrorism  which would cut off sympathy and support for those committing acts of terrorism. We must at the same time win the hearts and minds of the people to ensure that our victory over terrorism is not short-lived.  But the winning of hearts and minds is only half of what I would call the battle of perceptions. The other half consists of combating expressions of extremist sentiments. Despite our continuing efforts to promote world peace and harmony  we still witness the increasing trend to perpetuate and fuel Islamophobia. There have been attempts to pit Islam against the West  demonize Islam and to link Islam with terrorism. Those irresponsible acts further intensify the divide between the broader Muslim world and the West.   The real issue is not between Muslims and non-Muslims but between moderates and extremists in all religions  whether Islam  Christianity or Judaism. It is in light of the growing tide of extremist sentiments around the globe that the Prime Minister of Malaysia called for the creation of a global movement of moderates at this Assembly last year (see A/65/PV.19). This clarion call has come at the right moment in history. We must ensure that the voices of moderation  which currently constitute the silent majority  prevail over those of extremism in efforts to find solutions to the growing challenges faced by the international community.  There has been wide acceptance of this movement at the highest levels of global political leadership  such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the East Asia Summit. More recently  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has endorsed the movement of moderates as its contribution to global developments. Malaysia will work diligently to ensure that the global movement of moderates will complement the ongoing activities of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and other intercultural and interfaith dialogues so that moderation will triumph over extremism.  We cannot turn a blind eye to the needs of States that are severely affected by natural calamities. The situation in Somalia has touched the hearts of many. For our part  Malaysia last month pledged $1 million to    11-51670 32  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Trust Fund for Somalia and dispatched a humanitarian mission to mitigate the sufferings of our Somali brothers and sisters. A valiant Malaysian son lost his life carrying out this mission. However  such incidents will never deter us from continuing to provide humanitarian assistance to all other countries in need.  In the field of the environment  we seem to be losing focus. We know that we are not lacking in good plans  but that we lack political will and the means to implement those agreed plans. As much as we are concerned about implementation failures  we are also concerned at the paralysing differences in on the areas of institutional framework and sustainable development. The failure of the Commission on Sustainable Development to deliver a successful outcome last May clearly demonstrated that.   The lack of progress and unwillingness to honour commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is another example. We must ensure that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  coupled with historical responsibility  is enshrined in all our endeavours to achieve a successful conclusion on climate change negotiations and sustainable development.  In moving towards the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  there are new thoughts on strengthening the institutional frameworks for the environment. If the current institutional frameworks are unable to meet the daunting environmental challenges  we may have to look at new mechanisms that are inclusive and participatory  with equitable decision-making responsibilities.  Nuclear disarmament occupies a central role in the work of the United Nations. This is reflected by the fact that the very first resolution adopted by the General Assembly spoke  among other things  of “the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction” (resolution 1(I)  para. 5 (c)). Yet 65 years on  it remains a silent dream. All States need to do their part in order to achieve more substantive progress in this area.  Malaysia is committed to working with other Member States to realize the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world. We will continue to advocate the total elimination of nuclear weapons through a nuclear weapons convention. To progress further on that issue  consensus is required on commencing the multilateral negotiations process. This  in turn  will require good faith on the part of the States possessing nuclear weapons. I call on all those States to demonstrate such good faith.  It is apparent that the current international financial architecture is unable to cope with recent developments in the world financial markets. The World Bank has warned that we are about to enter a danger zone. We need a new financial architecture that will be transparent  equitable  representational and participatory and that will reduce volatility. Lessons can be learned from the economies of developing countries that embarked on economic reform and strengthened their financial institutions following the Asian financial crisis. Let us put pride aside and learn from each other.  In our quest to move up the value chain and enhance competitiveness  Malaysia has embarked on its own transformation programmes based on the concept of One Malaysia  the Government transformation programme  the economic transformation programme and the new economic model. As part of the transformation programme  Malaysia has taken a giant leap in reforming its internal security and emergency laws  which will be replaced by legislation to prevent subversive action  terrorism and organized crime.  Malaysia is transforming and reforming itself to better adapt to a changing global landscape. We believe that the United Nations must do the same. We would like to see a comprehensive reform of the United Nations so that it will be able to face current realities and address present challenges. Most particularly  the Security Council should be comprehensively reformed to make it more legitimate  representative  democratic and transparent. The Council must be effective  transparent and accountable to the larger United Nations membership in order to strengthen its mediation capacities. It must not remain beholden to the veto holders.  In that respect  I return to the President’s theme. We need to adopt mediation in the search for peace. To that  I would add the principles of transformation and moderation. A combination of mediation  transformation and moderation will constitute a winning formula to realize lasting world peace. Let us take up the challenge with the fortitude required and together implement it for a united and a better world for all."
"125",5029,"NAM",66,2011,"I wish to congratulate the President and his country  Qatar  on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session. With his wisdom and experience  I am confident that he will successfully steer the proceedings of the Assembly. I assure him of my delegation’s cooperation and support. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General.  I commend the President for choosing the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means as the theme for this debate. The peaceful settlement of disputes  as provided for in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter  is an important principle that the international community should uphold in seeking solutions to conflicts throughout the world.   Our Government recognizes the legitimacy of peaceful demands for democratic changes in sister countries such as Tunisia and Egypt. However  we believe that the demands for democratic change should be locally driven. They should not be used as a pretext to undermine the fundamental principle of sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of independent States.   We are concerned that all efforts by the African Union to find a peaceful negotiated solution in Libya were ignored and undermined. Never in the history of the United Nations has the sanctity of the principle of non-intervention been so compromised as we have witnessed recently in Libya. The military intervention by a foreign Power reminds Africa of the infamous Berlin Conference of 1884  when Africa was carved up by imperial Powers.  In the aftermath of the recent political changes in some African countries  it is important to underscore the need to promote genuine national reconciliation and unity and to begin urgently to address the challenges of poverty and unemployment  especially among the youth of the world. Respect for justice  fundamental human rights  the rule of law and good governance should be preconditions for lasting peace.   Following successful negotiations  the Republic of South Sudan attained its independence on 9 July 2011. This demonstrated the statesmanship and wisdom of the leaders of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan  who chose the path of peace and mediation. We call on the two countries to resolve all outstanding issues through peaceful means. I wish His Excellency President Salva Kiir Mayardit success as he leads the people of South Sudan in building a united and prosperous nation.  Namibia calls for the immediate implementation of the United Nations settlement plan and relevant United Nations resolutions calling for the holding of a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.  With regard to Palestine  I reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable right to self-determination and national independence. Namibia supports the admission of Palestine to the United Nations as a full Member.   The overwhelming majority of the Member States of the Assembly have for many years expressed serious concern over the continuing economic  commercial and financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba. Namibia calls for the immediate and unconditional lifting of this embargo.  Namibia welcomes the recent signing of the road map by the Malagasy political stakeholders with the facilitation of the Southern African Development Community mediator. It paves the way for bringing an end to the political crisis and returning Madagascar to constitutional order and democratic rule. The United Nations and the international community should provide adequate financial support to that country and become actively engaged in the ongoing mediation efforts to ensure the full implementation of the road map.    11-51185 20   The people of Somalia are faced with not only political uncertainty but also a severe drought and famine  which have resulted in a human catastrophe. Namibia has joined the international community in contributing food supplies to the people of Somalia as part of the international effort to address the crisis.  The effects of climate change are real and are acutely felt in every part of the globe. For the past three consecutive years Namibia has experienced devastating floods  which negatively impacted our development plans. I take this opportunity to once again thank members of the international community who responded to our emergency appeal for assistance.  Now more than ever before  all Member States should work towards the successful conclusion of the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which will take place in Durban  South Africa  later this year. This should set the tone for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  Rio+20  to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year.   The reform of the United Nations system  especially the Security Council  has been painfully slow. I underscore Namibia’s firm conviction that a reformed Security Council should be democratic  representative and transparent in its working methods. That is consistent with the African common position. It is incumbent on all Member States to work together to strengthen the Organization in order to guarantee international peace and security and to advance sustainable economic and social development for a fairer and more just world for all."
"126",5074,"NER",66,2011,"“They shall beat their swords into ploughshares  and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible  Isaiah 2:4)  Far from achieving Isaiah’s prophecy  humankind continues to face serious challenges at this time when His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss has passed the baton to the new President after presiding brilliantly over the General Assembly at its previous session. I have no doubt that on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  the President brings to it great strengths  bolstered in particular with the understanding and mastery of international realities he has acquired as  among other positions  Permanent Representative of his country  and having sat on the Security Council during Qatar’s non-permanent membership.  The President did well in choosing as the theme for his term “The role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes”. Under the guidance of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  sustained efforts have been made in this area. Here I would like to pay tribute   17 11-51191  to him for the work he has done during his first term and to congratulate him on his re-election on 21 June as head of the Organization. I would also like once again to thank him for the Organization’s unfailing support during the multiple crises that my country  Niger  has undergone in recent years. More generally  we have seen his commitment to the concerns of the African continent and hope that his new term will enable him to continue on the same path.  The choice of theme for the current session is proof that the prophecy of Isaiah  whose verse is rightly engraved in front of the United Nations building  has been slow to become reality. Indeed  the international situation has been and continues to be characterized by serious tensions. We might have thought that the end of the cold war would open the way to an age of full and lasting peace around the world. Unfortunately  owing to a lack of the ability or perhaps even the will to attack the evil at the root  our hope for a world free of conflict  like the line of the horizon  recedes as we approach it.  The root of the evil is bad political and economic governance. The promises of freedom  equality  justice  the rule of law and solidarity that have been made to the people of the world at the global and the national levels have not always been kept. The absence of global economic regulation  the domination of financial capital over even the real economy  the growth of inequalities between and within nations are just so many factors in the chaos  crises and conflicts that are disturbing peace around the world. Besides  can a world where several billion people live in poverty be peaceful? What do the billion human beings who are hungry have to lose? Can the Somalis  who are suffering the tortures of hunger right now  or the inhabitants of the Sahel  who deal with hunger over and over again  believe that they live in a just  humane world? Can extreme poverty coexist peacefully with extreme wealth?  Today  1 210 people  that is  17 per 100 million of the world’s population  control revenues of $4 500 billion — 8 per cent of the world’s aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) — while the income of 20 per cent of the poorest represents only 1.5 per cent  and that of the 2.5 billion people who live on less than $2 a day — 40 per cent of the total population — represents only 5 per cent. Thus a thousand or so people have an income one and a half times larger than all the 2.5 billion people living on less than $2 a day. Besides being morally shocking  this situation is economically inefficient  since it strangles economic growth. Furthermore  the implementation of structural adjustment programmes that began in the 1980s is a perfect illustration of bad global economic governance. The liberalization and privatization touted by such programmes were conducted anarchically; even today  such liberalization has been applied only in sectors where weak countries such as ours have no relative advantages. As we know  such liberalization did not affect the markets for labour or agricultural products. My country  Niger  has suffered greatly from such policies.  This is  finally  where we should recall that the promise made by the world’s wealthy nations  beginning in the 1970s  to increase their public development aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP has still not been kept. If you add to that the recent crises in banking and sovereign debt  along with the shortfall in direct investment in Africa  where there is nonetheless great scope for economic growth  you can understand the inadequacy of global economic growth  particularly the collapse of economic growth in wealthy countries. The economic elasticity and resilience we need to cope with the crises will grow only with the development of the countries of the South. The world’s equilibrium depends on the balanced development of all its regions; in particular  the creation of a powerful middle class in every region of the world will strengthen economic growth  stability and peace.  For more than 60 years  the Middle East has been one of the most turbulent regions on the planet. We had great hopes for the resumption on 9 May 2010 of indirect negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians  mediated by the United Nations. The start of direct bilateral negotiations represented real hope for reaching a global peace agreement based on a two-State solution  with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours.  It is undoubtedly the failure of those talks that has led the Palestinian Authority to take steps to achieve recognition of the State of Palestine based  on the one hand  on the 1967 borders  and on the other  on its admission as a full Member of the United Nations. This is the moment for our Organization to take a bold decision designed to settle the Israel-Palestinian problem definitively  a settlement without which the Arab Spring will be unable to guarantee peace and    11-51191 18  security in the entire Middle East. Indeed  the failure of democracies to resolve this long-standing crisis will inevitably reinforce terrorism and will erase the democratic achievements of the Spring.   My country  Niger  one of the 122 Member States that have already recognized the State of Palestine  is supporting its request for full membership in the United Nations  as presented this morning at this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.  The tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the United States  commemorated last 11 September  and the recent suicide attack against the United Nations headquarters in Abuja in Nigeria prove that no region of the world is safe from terrorism. We firmly condemn all acts of terrorism  wherever  for whatever reason and by whomever they are committed  as they present one of the most serious threats to peace and security.   Terrorism  as the Assembly knows  attacks the values that constitute the essence of the United Nations Charter: respect for human rights  the rule of law  the rules governing war and the protection of civilians  tolerance among peoples and nations and the peaceful resolution of disputes.   In Niger  we face this threat on our northern border with Algeria  to the west with Mali and to the south with Nigeria. I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Nigerian security and defence forces  some of whom have given their lives in their commitment to protecting our country from terrorism.   Along with that threat  of course  we also have to face criminal organizations that traffic in weapons  drugs and human beings. All of these threats have been exacerbated by the Libyan crisis. Indeed  arms depots have been pillaged in Libya. Those weapons are now distributed throughout the Sahara and Sahel area and risk ending up in the hands of terrorists. Given the regional nature of the threats  Niger is determined to work jointly with other countries  especially in our subregion  to deal with the situation. The risk to the stability of the entire subregion  where some countries experience recurrent rebellions  should not be underestimated.   We hope that there will be a rapid solution to the crisis  which would not just have a security impact on Niger  but also an economic and social impact  given the work stoppage on the road construction that was being financed by Libya  the return from Libya of over 210 000 migrant Niger nationals and the arrival of increasing numbers of Libyan refugees fleeing the war. Niger is a democratic country  governed by the rule of law  and we will treat these refugees in compliance with our laws and international law. Until now  our country  with very limited means  has been bearing this terrible burden alone. Our country therefore requires support and help from the international community in terms of both the security and the economic issues  as we are on the frontlines of the war against terrorism.   Niger would also like to see a rapid return to peace and stability in this brotherly country and reconciliation among Libyans. We are concerned by the situation  because the democratic institutions that our countries are trying to build are still fragile. We are concerned because the reality of widespread poverty provides a breeding ground for terrorism.   My country  Niger  believes that  apart from immediate security solutions  the strengthening of democratic institutions and economic and social development are the only ways to confine terrorism and guarantee peace. Democratic values are universal. It has been decisively proven: there is no such thing as climate determinism  which would condemn hot countries to despotism and temperate countries to democracy. In understanding this  the world has made a quantum leap  convincing even those who would believe that the fight for democracy is simply a new version of the mission to civilize  which was the justification for the colonialism of the past century brought about by the alliance of the sword and the censer.   As a Muslim  I would like to say that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam. Islam has always emphasized fraternity and justice. It has always emphasized the intrinsic unity of all human beings and their equality  whatever their origins. Islam therefore proclaims that all men are equal like the teeth of a comb in the hands of a weaver. Islam is a religion of tolerance.    “I do not serve that which you serve  nor do you serve Him Whom I serve: nor am I going to serve that which you serve  nor are you going to serve Him Whom I serve: you shall have your religion and I shall have my religion.” (The Holy Koran  CIX: 2-6)   19 11-51191   Those are the divine words  full of tolerance  from a sura of the Koran. Thus  terrorism has nothing to do with Islam  with real Islam  which is a religion of the happy medium  and the fight against terrorism should not be considered a religious conflict  a clash between two civilizations  a struggle between Judeo-Christian civilization and Muslim civilization  or a fight to the death between the Christian West and the Muslim East. The world must not return to the religious wars of the Middle Ages. Quite the opposite  it should be able to integrate the values of two civilizations that are  at their root  both from the same area  the Middle East.  Climate change is another challenge that the world is facing. Greenhouse gases are one of its causes. The least developed poor countries  of which Niger is unfortunately a member  only produce 1 per cent of those gases. We in Niger suffer from the effects of climate change on a recurring basis. Indeed  our people live off of subsistence agriculture and livestock-raising. Those two sectors  on which the poorest  in particular women and children  rely  are very vulnerable to climate change. The droughts and floods in Niger over the past 10 years show  needless to say  a trend towards a growing number of extreme weather events.   In view of this  we decided to implement the Three Ns initiative  that is  “the people of Niger Nourishing the people of Niger”. As we believe that drought does not need to necessarily bring about famine  we have decided to increase the yields of rain-fed agriculture  to promote irrigation  to modernize livestock-raising methods and to implement a robust policy of environmental protection. As we know that the harvest this season will be poor  we have decided to implement an emergency irrigation programme  to rebuild our food stocks and to alert the international community to the situation. From this rostrum I renew my country’s appeal to the international community for aid for Niger  which  in addition to threats from the Libyan crisis  from terrorists and from criminal organizations of every kind  is also facing severe food insecurity.   The terrible recurrent drought that Niger lives with spurred our decision to restructure our economy. Our country has significant mineral resources — uranium  gold  coal  cement  which are already being mined  as well as oil  the first barrel of which will be produced before the end of 2011. While the curse of mineral resources has had unfortunate results in other countries  we will exploit our resources to the sole benefit of the people of Niger. In accordance with the Extraction Industries Transparency Initiative  we mean to invest the profits to the benefit of the people of Niger  especially in agriculture  animal husbandry  energy and transportation infrastructure  education  health and access to water. The resulting boost to our economy will allow us to create tens of thousands of jobs  especially for young people. Niger encourages private investment  especially foreign direct investment. Besides the legal protection we offer by promoting the rule of law  we have also just adopted a law on public-private partnerships in order to expedite funding.  We have the duty to create a fairer and more humane world. To achieve that noble aim we need new global governance. That will require a profound reform of international organizations  in particular the United Nations  the World Trade Organization  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The democratization of those institutions is absolutely necessary; it is a sine qua non condition for peace and stability in the world. For decisions to be accepted and implemented by everyone  they must be taken in a collaborative  participatory way.  I would like to focus now on our great Organization. The United Nations is at once a permanent space for political dialogue among the countries we represent and a forum for the expression of the solidarity necessary among our peoples. It is also where we turn for the realization of our hopes. For all those reasons  reform of the United Nations must proceed faster. Africa takes a common position on this issue  which my country shares. We deeply believe that  given its worldwide mandate to deal with major issues like peace  security  development and human rights  the United Nations must be fair  representative and democratic. We believe in an ongoing revitalization of the General Assembly  the common forum that we all hold dear. We have no doubt that the President of the Assembly will move forward the process of democratizing the United Nations. The same is true of reform of the Security Council  which we all await and which Africa has always called for  through its representatives  especially the Committee of Ten African Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors.    11-51191 20   Before concluding  I want to return to the theme of mediation. Our countries and the United Nations itself could increase their effectiveness in managing issues of peace  security and development if they sought resolution through mediation. The importance of the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes is incontestable. In fact  it is an essential tool in the peaceful settlement of disputes  which the Charter itself recommends to States in Article 33.  In Niger we have experienced the benefits of mediation  through the United Nations  the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States  in our recent political and institutional crisis. It is true that mediation can be tedious  but in the end it bears fruit. We endorse every effort that aims to promote peace through mediation  both in active and potential conflicts. We also encourage the Department of Political Affairs to keep the principle in mind in its work."
"127",5120,"NGA",66,2011,"On behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria  I would like to congratulate the President on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I have no doubt that under his able leadership the work of the session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to acknowledge the excellent work done by his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  who guided the affairs of the sixty-fifth session with consummate skill and commitment.  I must also take this opportunity to extend my warmest felicitations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his well-deserved re-election  a tribute to his leadership and vision. He deserves our appreciation for the good work he is doing on our behalf.  I also welcome the newest member of the Organization  the Republic of South Sudan. I am confident that South Sudan will bring a unique perspective to the work of the United Nations and enrich our collective experience.  Despite our initial optimism  the peace dividend we had hoped would accrue following the end of the Cold War is yet to materialize. On the contrary  the world of the twenty-first century in which we live is becoming ever more precarious  unpredictable and certainly more dangerous — perhaps more than at any other time in history. The increasing use of terror in various regions of the world as a form of political action poses a serious threat to international peace and security. We must win the war against terror because it infringes on the fundamental right of all peoples to life and to live in safety from fear.  Over the past few months  we in Nigeria have faced an upsurge in terrorist attacks in parts of our country. Only recently  the United Nations building in Abuja housing several United Nations agencies was the target of an atrocious terrorist attack that left several dead. On behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria  I would like to convey my sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the entire United Nations family for this barbaric and heinous attack on those who have dedicated their lives to helping others. As the United States and the rest of the world commemorate the tenth anniversary of the attacks of 9/11  we are reminded of the international    11-50692 44  dimension of terrorism and the imperative of a concerted global response to combat this scourge.  For us in Nigeria  terrorist acts  rather than intimidating us  will only help to strengthen our resolve to develop appropriate national strategies and to collaborate even more closely with the international community in the fight against this menace. As part of Nigeria’s efforts to fight terrorism  on 3 June  I signed into law a terrorism bill and an anti-money-laundering prohibition amendment act. The new laws not only outline measures for preventing and combating acts of terrorism  but also prohibit the financing of terrorism and laundering of the proceeds of crime. Nigeria will continue to work with the United Nations and other partners in this global fight.  To that end  Nigeria is working closely with the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate  as well as with relevant international bodies and friendly countries  in order to sharpen our response mechanisms. In that connection  the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force will launch its first project in Abuja in November  which will be aimed at preventing conflict and countering the appeal of terrorism to youth through education and dialogue. In addition  Nigeria is a member of a new global body  the Global Counterterrorism Forum  launched to galvanize and help pull our efforts together to fight this scourge in all its ramifications. We pledge to continue to work with all stakeholders as we enlarge and intensify our partnerships.  When I stood before the Assembly last year  I made a solemn pledge that Nigeria would conduct free and credible elections in the second quarter of this year. I am glad to report that last April we indeed conducted what have been adjudged to be credible and transparent general elections. Let me take this opportunity to thank the United Nations and all the other organizations  nations and individuals that helped us to achieve that feat. The elections are now behind us  and the Government that I head is well on course to implement our programmes of transformation — a strategic plan for the delivery of the dividends of democracy to citizens and for preparing our country for the challenges of the future. Indeed  all across my country  there is a renewed sense of optimism and self-belief in our ability to recreate a new Nigeria on the principles of personal freedoms  democracy  good governance and the rule of law.  Permit me to identify with the theme of this year’s debate of engaging the role of mediation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world. The Assembly will recall that Nigeria was in the forefront of the campaign to promote this theme when  as the President of the Security Council in July 2010  my country adopted the use of preventive diplomacy to resolve armed conflicts across the world. This theme is apt and could not have come at a better time  when armed conflicts are increasingly taking a greater part of the time and resources of the United Nations.  For too long  the international community has focused too little attention on mediation and preventive diplomacy  and far too much effort and resources on the military aspects of peace and security. Yet measures to address the root cause of conflict  including dialogue and mediation  can be far more effective as a means for achieving sustainable peace and stability.  I believe that cultivating peace and fulfilling the aims of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter require early identification and appropriate intervention in conflict situations in order to build confidence and trust and to preclude the eruption of violence between opposing parties. As I see it  our goal should always be to present the peaceful alternative as a less costly and effective way of achieving political and social objectives. I also believe that  in addition to other traditional tools of preventive diplomacy  democracy and good governance can be particularly important in building a just  equitable and inclusive society. By focusing on mediation as a tool for conflict prevention  we are able to address the real triggers of conflict  without which we cannot achieve sustainable solutions.  However  for the world to move from a culture of response after conflict to that of a culture of prevention  the international community must muster the political will to promote preventive diplomacy  in particular through mediation. This will necessarily entail rededicating greater human and financial resources to institutions and mechanisms that already exist  within and outside the United Nations system  for conflict prevention and resolution.  Going forward  I would like to propose the establishment  under the Secretary-General’s Office  of a conflict mediation commission  to be charged  among other things  with collating information on conflict situations across the world  identifying the dramatis   45 11-50692  personae and developing appropriate strategies for initiating the resolution of such conflicts. The commission would also develop rules of engagement  including sanctions that would apply to those who may obstruct efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully.  This naturally brings me to the issue of trafficking in small arms and light weapons. If the idea of resolving conflicts through mediation is to succeed  then the problem of trafficking in small arms and light weapons must be frontally tackled. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons is particularly worrisome  due to their easy accessibility and availability to unauthorized persons and groups  who in turn have used these arms to create instability and insecurity in most of the countries of the developing world. Even worse  the proliferation of these weapons has proved handy in the hands of terrorists.  This explains our commitment to  and preoccupation with  the actualization of an arms trade treaty that robustly addresses the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  which  as we all know  are among the major causes of destabilization and conflict in Africa. The danger of the proliferation of  and illicit trade in  small arms and light weapons informed Nigeria’s decision to sponsor resolution 61/89  of 2006  the principal objective being to provide a legally binding international instrument for the trade in conventional arms. We will continue to support all initiatives towards the realization of an arms trade treaty in 2012. I call on all Member States to join in this endeavour.  The increasing rate of piracy and other maritime crimes  with their attendant damaging effects on security  trade and economic activities in the Gulf of Guinea and other locations  calls for coordinated regional and global approaches. In this respect  I would like to express support for the proposal of the Secretary-General to deploy a United Nations assessment mission to study the situation in the Gulf of Guinea and explore possible options for United Nations support and action. Our expectation is that a positive outcome from such a strategy will benefit not only our subregion but the larger international community as well. I am already consulting with other leaders in our subregion to boost this initiative.  The United Nations strategy for gender equality and women’s empowerment  especially through the creation of UN-Women  deserves commendation and support. Nigeria’s support for UN-Women  to which we have made substantial contributions  reflects our desire to harness the potential of women in the task of nation-building.  Our national action plan on gender equality and women’s empowerment places strong emphasis on women’s effective participation in politics and adequate representation in public office. I am indeed proud to announce to the Assembly that more than 30 per cent of my Cabinet is made up of women. Let me also commend the Executive Board of UN-Women on the successful take-off of the entity. UN-Women can be assured of Nigeria’s strong support.  This year  the prevention of non-communicable diseases was one of the issues slated for discussion at a High-level Meeting. Only three months ago  I attended the High-level Meeting on AIDS  where I pledged Nigeria’s commitment to health care  as part of our country’s human capital development agenda. My Government is intensifying efforts to improve national health-care delivery by allocating substantial resources to primary health care. We look forward to a productive outcome to the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases at the end of that meeting.   In the same vein  I welcome discussions at the High-level Meeting on desertification and land degradation  as these issues continue to pose challenges to our development efforts. That is why Nigeria strongly supports the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity  including strategies and best practices to address this challenge.  In order to demonstrate our commitment to human rights  Nigeria recently ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and acceded to four other international human rights instruments  including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.   In addition  this year  my Government passed into law the National Human Rights Commission Amendment Act  the Legal Aid Council Amendment Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Nigeria will continue to accord the highest priority to human rights issues  as they speak directly to the dignity and inalienable rights of humankind.    11-50692 46   We in West Africa are passing through an exciting season of democratic rebirth. Before the end of 2011  elections will have been held in six countries in West Africa. Those elections will set the respective countries along the path of political stability  progress  good governance and sustainable development — some of the benefits of which we have begun to experience. The progress we have made would not have been possible without the support of the United Nations.  The resolution of the conflict in Côte d’Ivoire is a case in point. I consider the inauguration of President Ouattara a success not just for Côte d’Ivoire but also for the international community  which spoke with one voice and acted in concert in support of the Ivorian people. The end of that crisis must be seen by all as the beginning of our journey towards the consolidation of democratic culture and good governance in Africa. Having put that crisis behind us  the international community must now provide robust assistance to the country as it embarks on the tasks of post-conflict reconstruction and national reconciliation.  The struggle for self-governance and majority rule in Africa started in the 1940s; and by 1957 Ghana had gained independence. Today  all African States have achieved self-determination and majority rule. Those are no small achievements. But we still have much work to do. A great deal of the work that remains is to build viable and capable States in Africa on the principles of popular participation  the rule of law and respect for human rights  as we pledged to do in the Constitutive Act of the African Union. Nigeria believes that those values must remain at the core of governance in Africa if we are ever to achieve the goals of stability  security and development.  As Nigeria is approaching the end of its tenure on the Security Council  I would like to express my country’s deep appreciation for the opportunity to serve in that important organ. In the course of our stewardship  the Council had the courage to reach many difficult decisions that resulted in positive developments around the world. We are proud to be associated with those decisions. I would like to urge the Council to continue its important work in the maintenance of international peace and security.   In spite of the Council’s many successes  it is our belief that that important organ would benefit from the vigour and fresh perspectives that only a revamped Council accommodating changing global political realities can provide. I urge the President of the General Assembly to set up clear criteria for the reform of the Security Council in line with the demand of the majority of the world. A reformed Security Council is the only way to demonstrate that all nations have an equal stake in the United Nations. Nigeria looks forward to the prospect of membership in a reformed Security Council."
"128",5165,"NIC",66,2011,"At this general debate of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  I convey to the Assembly a Christian  socialist greeting of solidarity from the people of Nicaragua and Comrade President Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra. We trust that our work will contribute to strengthening the Organization through an appropriate focus on its purposes  principles and possible contributions so that we can successfully deal with the challenges before us as a community of States  peoples and nations.  One year ago  during our discussions at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly  we extensively addressed the serious and multifaceted international crisis experienced by humankind. At that time we called it an apocalyptical crisis. One year later  the evolution of world events has confirmed our profoundest fears that our civilization is now at a critical stage and that peace between States and peoples is dangerously at risk.  Expectations that the international economic and financial situation would improve have dissipated before the relentless reality of a profound crisis; its gravest effects still continue to affect deeply our peoples. The international financial system  which is controlled by speculators  again plunged into a tailspin. The measures taken have had a temporary  non-lasting effect owing to the ever increasing greed of bankers. We are now witnessing the effects of the United States internal debt problem  which has generated great losses in most exchange markets.  At present  as before  we affirm that we reject the language of war between peoples and we reject war as a means to resolve conflicts between States. In the light of the events in the brotherly Arab socialist popular republic of Libya  we reiterate our declaration of principle and express our solidarity with the brotherly Libyan people.  The blunt and shameful manipulation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) regarding Libya — the illegal war being carried out by NATO members — is the most recent example of the pathological need of particular States to attempt to subordinate the peoples of the world at any cost. It is the most recent example of attacks against the sovereignty of a State Member of the United Nations in violation of the Charter of the United Nations.  Nicaragua expresses its firmest rejection of the use of the misnamed responsibility to protect in order to intervene in our countries  bomb civilians and    11-51398 4  change free and sovereign governments. We cannot allow the imposition of this new model of imperialist aggression nor the continued aggression against our peoples. Interference and intervention will not resolve crises; only dialogue and negotiation among brothers and sisters will resolve political crises among peoples.  The unacceptable policy of double standards has become a constant of those Powers  which clearly aspire to hegemony. Where are those countries  the supposed defenders of oppressed peoples  the self-proclaimed civilian protection apostles  when an attempt is being made to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  their right to live in peace  their right to a sovereign State enjoying full recognition as a State Member of the United Nations? This is clearly an instance of double morals  double standards. After six decades of conflict  the Palestinian people are now to be denied their right to a State  while a mere 10 days ago  with unheard of haste and  I must note  a certain irony  the General Assembly recognized a transitional council that has not yet formed a Government.  We reject the logic of denying the very existence of a Palestinian State. From the moment of triumph of our revolution in 1979 — the Sandinista revolution — Nicaragua has been a proud witness to the noble struggle of the Palestinian people and their substantial concessions aimed at achieving peace.  Before the General Assembly  Nicaragua ratifies its recognition of the Palestinian State within its 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. We call  here and now  for the proclamation of Palestine as the 194th State Member of the United Nations. Recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people can only serve to promote Middle East peace and stability. At present  more than ever  such recognition must become a reality. Clearly  Palestine’s right is linked to the existence of the State of Israel  a State we recognize in juridical and political terms. May both States exist  so that both peoples may live in peace and work for their well-being and development: That is the universal appeal.  Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly for more than two decades have demanded an end to the United States of America’s economic embargo against Cuba. They must be fully implemented. Despite expectations  the facts confirm that nothing has changed. Sanctions against Cuba remain intact and are rigorously implemented. That criminal blockade violates international law; it is contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and constitutes a crime against a sovereign State’s right to peace  development and security. In its essence and its objectives  it is an act of unilateral aggression and a permanent threat to a country’s stability.  Despite that criminal blockade  Cuba continues daily to strengthen its solidarity and fraternal relations with all peoples of the world. Cuba’s armies of white coats and educators are ever more numerous in demonstrating their country’s solidarity. We also echo the call for an end to the injustice against the five Cuban heroes who have been unjustly imprisoned for 13 years as of this past 12 September  for having alerted their people to the activities of terrorist organizations against Cuba.  As unlikely as it may seem  the process of decolonization has not ended  and there remain entire peoples who have been denied their right to independence and self determination. We welcome and maintain our solidarity with the peoples of Puerto Rico  the Western Sahara and the struggle of the Frente Polisario and with Argentina with regard to the occupation of the Malvinas Islands.  Observations made in the Assembly in 2010 regarding the need to achieve a balance between human beings and Mother Earth remain relevant; they have even led us to conclude that  far from diminishing  pressures on the planet have increased; threats have escalated and real and potential dangers have multiplied.  Among those  the Fukushima disaster in Japan had the virtue of bringing into view the chilling global risk of radiation. The Japanese crisis has rightly been described as a nuclear war without war. Its present and future repercussions  which have not yet been fully established  are considered by recognized scientists to be more serious than those of the Chernobyl disaster.  While expressing our solidarity with the Government and the heroic people of Japan — the victims of the earthquake that levelled their territory and those affected by the Fukushima accident — we vehemently call on States with nuclear reactor installations to take all measures to avoid similar accidents that would gravely endanger people’s health and would harm the environment.   5 11-51398   The upcoming Durban Climate Change Conference and the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development will provide renewed opportunities — which we must not allow ourselves to squander — to truly break with destructive logic and redirect humankind towards development that is in harmony with Mother Earth and respectful of the lives of the 7 billion human beings now populating the planet.  We all know that we have been incapable of achieving an accord on climate change. Although the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change established a Green Fund and called for the mobilization of financing for developing countries  that accord is far from addressing the serious damage being done to the environment and Mother Earth or the historical responsibility of the developed countries  which are bent on dealing a final blow to the Kyoto Protocol so as to continue their uncontrolled emissions of greenhouse effect gases.  In Rio and in Durban we will be called upon to renew our political will and adopt genuine  concrete commitments based on previous progress and commitments. The issue is of transcendental importance for our planet and for human beings. Development must not sacrifice life. We recall that the Universal Declaration on the Common Well-Being of Mother Earth and of humankind is an essential guide for our debates and actions.  Looking at other issues  Nicaragua salutes the international community’s invitation to Taiwan to participate in the assemblies of United Nations specialized agencies directly related to the well-being of the 23 million Taiwanese. We urge other international forums to adopt similar positions.  The global economic and financial crisis has compounded the already serious food crisis  primarily in impoverished countries. We know that this crisis also has structural causes in the present capitalist development model — a model that discourages internal production and impedes technology transfer to the agricultural sector of impoverished countries  a model without available credit or technical training for small and medium producers  which results in production difficulties.  Climate change has become an additional major factor in the deepening of the food crisis. The trend towards higher oil prices at the international level has caused some countries with an agricultural base to begin producing biofuel. That phenomenon has significantly changed food supply and demand and has reinforced the trend toward higher prices.  From the ethical point of view  as well as political  economic and social  it is essential to take immediate concerted action to avoid the continuing increase in the number of hungry people and to develop sustainable policies for guaranteeing food security worldwide.  We renew our commitment to the cause of general and complete disarmament. It is imperative that we establish peace on Earth and provide the 7 billion human beings who inhabit it  and Mother Earth itself  with the opportunity to survive the destructive tendencies promoted by the dominant economic model  so that humankind may develop in an environment conducive to manifesting our enormous spiritual and material capacities. No other way will enable us to achieve a better future.  It is therefore unjustifiable and unacceptable that the present world continues to spend more on the development and testing of all types of weapons and less on protecting the life and development of human beings. While millions of persons suffer the effects of the economic and financial crisis  global military expenditures have skyrocketed. Over the past 10 years  those expenditures have increased by 50 per cent  to $1.5 trillion today. More than 8 million small arms and light weapons and more than 16 billion munitions are produced every year  the equivalent to more than 2.5 munitions for every single person on the planet. That arms proliferation causes irreparable direct and indirect harm to peoples and their economies.  We can end that proliferation if we decide to. It is not true that the arms sector is vitally important to the world economy. In fact  despite what the producers of small arms and light weapons would have us believe  their trade and the trade in munitions and components represent less than 0.01 per cent of the world’s industrial transactions.  We are firmly convinced that because the Korean peninsula remains a focal point of international tension  any solution must take place through goodwill and sincere dialogue between the parties in order to maintain peace and stability.    11-51398 6   The factors called new threats to security have become an outright scourge for most of our countries. Drug trafficking  human trafficking  illegal arms trafficking  and the trafficking of immigrants  among others  constitute ethical  political and economic challenges for Central America  which is stigmatized today in some international reports as one of the most violent regions on Earth. That stigmatization is deliberate and carries serious consequences for our countries. It transforms us into protagonists of the problem rather than the victims we truly are  victims of the lucrative businesses that constitute those new threats. Through transnational networks they utilize our territories as a bridge from South to North and from North to South  in a dance of millionaires as thousands of people are assassinated along illegal routes and porous borders.  The International Conference of Support for the Central American Security Strategy  held in Guatemala last June  exposed the seriousness of a situation that exists not only in our region  but in all of the countries of the world. That is why the principle of shared but differentiated and proportional responsibility must guide mutual commitments. It is urgent that we move in the right direction before it is too late for us all.  Nicaragua is going through a time of change aimed at reversing the negative effects of 16 long years under neoliberal Governments. We are recovering values  restoring rights  strengthening capacities and constructing a new model based on replacing the neoliberal model of untrammeled capitalism with one based on Christian  socialist and solidarity principles. We are articulating popular democracy through the national human development plan. Together these constitute the backbone of a new phase of the Sandinista revolution.  These achievements are due in large part to Nicaragua’s integration into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas  an initiative stemming from the genius of Fidel Castro  the Commander in Chief of the Cuban revolution  and of Commander-President Hugo Chávez Frías. This brotherhood  unique in today’s world  enables solidarity  complementarity and fair trade between our peoples and advances the historical cultural unity of our peoples.  At the same time  our national human development plan is aimed specifically at promoting the country’s economic and social health by adding jobs and reducing poverty and inequality  on a basis of sovereignty  security and integration. The restoration of the human and constitutional right of all Nicaraguans to free education is reflected in the fact that  in a country with a total population of 6.5 million  1 821 682 students are now enrolled in schools. This year we are launching the battle for universal primary education  aiming at universal sixth grade education by 2012. The goal is to achieve universal enrolment in the third year of secondary school by 2015.  The restoration of the human and constitutional right of the Nicaraguan people to free health care means providing better access to  and improving the quality of  health services  reducing maternal and infant mortality  paying more attention to the development of young people  expanding community family health services  and the first large-scale registering of people with disabilities. Our Programa Amor is designed for boys and girls under six years old and for street children and adolescents  and those who work during school terms  in order to restore to them their fundamental rights.  In structural areas  we are making progress in transforming the energy matrix so that by 2017  90 per cent of energy will be from renewable sources and 10 per cent from fossil fuels  radically inverting the pyramid we inherited in 2006. We are enjoying macroeconomic stability  with gross national product growth projected at 4 per cent or more. Our improvement policies have increased direct foreign investment in our country’s strategic sectors. We have had outstanding successes in confronting drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. Nicaragua is now recognized as one of the safest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  and the safest in Central America. We have had indisputable successes in reducing poverty and inequality  as has been recognized by international financial institutions.  We are fervent supporters of the integration and unity of Central America  Latin America and the Caribbean. Within the framework of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  we are securing our model through complementarity  investments  fair trade and solidarity.   With our neighbours and brothers in Honduras and El Salvador  we are working together for the sustainable development of the Gulf of Fonseca.   7 11-51398  Comrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has also made several approaches to the Government and people of our neighbour to the south  Costa Rica  concerning the possibility of joint development of our common border  particularly in terms of protecting and restoring the environment and working on sustainable economic and social development for the benefit of both our peoples. Throughout this process  young people and women have been at the forefront of the direct democracy model that is the essence and continuity of the Sandinista revolution.  Nicaragua can demonstrate the profound  concrete and verifiable economic  social  political  legislative and cultural achievements our people are undergoing. In the context of the serious crises that so many countries  developed and developing  are going through  our Christian  socialist  solidarity model is an inspiration for an ever better future.   We are aware of our difficulties and limitations. We know that the weight of the historical structure that we inherited is still a liability that we must cast off in our national development process. The burdens of poverty and underdevelopment require sound policies and sustained effort and political and governing systems that have the necessary commitment to our people’s aspirations. I can assure the Assembly that through our Government of national reconciliation and unity we will achieve that and more.  As we have said before  it is not easy for developing countries such as ours to deal with an issue of the breadth and depth of the global economic and financial crisis. We have yet to recover from the harsh effects of the last wave  while the new threat of another and greater crisis is bearing down on us. According to the International Monetary Fund  Central America’s response to the previous world economic and financial crisis was in large part successful. We were able to deal with the situation successfully — success with costs that in Nicaragua’s case were not passed on to the poorest  because the measures we adopted were based on the interests of our country as a whole.  As we consider international developments  we must also turn our attention to our own Organization. Global democratization must be accompanied by democratization of the United Nations without further delay.   In his book La reinvención de la ONU: una propuesta  our comrade and friend  the former President of the Assembly  General Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann — who is with us here — states that it is urgent that we give true meaning to democracy and independence in the United Nations  so that the opinions of all can be heard and so that those opinions really count in the decision-making process  with no one being excluded.  This proposal  adopted by our national reconciliation and unity Government  consists of proposals on the United Nations charter  the statute of the International Court of Justice and the statute for the International Tribunal for Climate Justice and Environmental Protection  as well as a proposal on a draft universal declaration on the common good of mother earth and humankind.  Reinvention and re-grounding are key concepts that will pave the way for an international system based on genuine multilateralism that is in harmony with the changes the world has undergone during the past few decades. We must restore a true political dimension to international law and to the rights of people.  Developed societies are sinking into the despair caused by unemployment  the lack of social security  financial insolvency  the implosion of established labour rights and an uncertain future. Global Powers are waging wars of aggression with no moral or political base  causing material destruction and enormous human suffering. Economic and financial recovery are nowhere in sight; on the contrary  specialists foresee a recession even more serious than the one we have recently experienced.  Where do we find the solution we so urgently need? Where do we regain hope in the possibility of a different present and future world  in which there is peace between States and nations? In which development efforts and impressive scientific and technological advances are equitably shared? In which  as the Greek sophist Protagoras put it  man is the measure of all things?  According to many prominent thinkers on the global reality  the final crisis of the capitalist development model has arrived. There is no time for reforms. As Leonardo Boff has said    “We need to find another way of thinking  one based on principles and values that can sustain a new test of civilization. If not  we will have to    11-51398 8  accept a path that leads straight to the edge of the precipice. Dinosaurs already took that path.”   Nicaragua is proceeding on the belief that a better future is possible if only we are capable of steering in a new direction  if we struggle for justice and peace  and if we commit ourselves to the development and defence of the common good of the Earth and of humankind."
"129",5212,"NLD",66,2011,"In May I visited Tunisia  the cradle of the revolutions that have spread across the Arab world. I spoke to many people there who told me about their deep yearning for freedom  about the decades during which their freedom had been suppressed and about what the revolution meant for their lives. One of them was Essma Ben Hamida  the strong-willed director of a civil society organization active in micro-finance. She said literally to me  “If    11-51390 16  democracy would mean that I lose my rights as a woman  I do not want democracy.” In one sentence  Ms. Ben Hamida defined one of the key challenges we face.  The call from the streets of the Arab world for freedom and democracy has brought about great change. It has inspired people around the world to claim their rights.   But huge challenges remain. And the severe financial and economic crisis is threatening growth and trade around the globe. This crisis is undermining people’s ability to earn a living and enjoy freedom to the fullest extent. It is thus crucial that we manage these developments.   The United Nations and individual Governments must support people’s calls for freedom. Freedom is a right for everyone  a duty for Governments and the mission of the United Nations. Freedom must be supported by three key pillars: first  security; second  democracy and the rule of law; and third  prosperity.  Lack of security is a fundamental threat to people’s freedom. Providing security is a responsibility of Governments and of the international community as a whole.  In March this year  we rose to the challenge. Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya was truly historic. It explicitly referred to the international community’s responsibility to protect. It highlighted the indispensable role of the United Nations.  By contrast  the Council’s failure to reach consensus on Syria has been at great human cost. Every day we are shocked by new  horrific stories. This very weekend peaceful demonstrators were carrying a sign that read: “Help Syria. It is bleeding.” We need to listen to the people of Syria. We need to stop President Al-Assad’s Government from brutally murdering his own citizens in an attempt to crush their legitimate call for freedom. I urge all members of the Security Council to act decisively and agree on targeted sanctions against the regime.  Freedom and security are also key issues in the Middle East peace process. If we do want peace  we need direct negotiations now  not new resolutions at the United Nations. The Netherlands endorses the time frame outlined by the Quartet and stands ready to assist wherever it can. We are a major donor to the Palestinian Authority. We fully support the ambition of the Palestinian people to build a viable  democratic and peaceful Palestinian State. However  this cannot be viewed separately from the Israeli people’s desire to live in a secure  internationally recognized Jewish State in peace with their neighbours.   It is really essential that the two parties invest in mutual confidence  refrain from unilateral steps and find a solution together. They should be prepared to make the difficult and painful concessions necessary for the fulfilment of their peoples’ aspirations. I talked with President Abbas. I talked with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I listened carefully to what they had to say  and the message is simple and clear: negotiate  negotiate  negotiate.  Democracy and the rule of law are the best guarantees for freedom  but they require hard work. As Francis Fukuyama put it  democracy is more than the majority voting in elections. It is a complex set of institutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of power through law and a system of checks and balances. That is what it is about.   I admire the tremendous courage that people  young and old  have shown to claim their individual liberty and democratic rights. We must support their efforts to build truly democratic societies governed by the rule of law. The United Nations should play a leading role by helping with institution-building and developing the rule of law. To that effect  Slovakia and the Netherlands  for their part  are co-chairing the Community of Democracies’ task force that is supporting Tunisia’s democratic transition.  The international community should also support internet access that is free and uncensored. This is an essential tool for people to exercise their freedom of expression  and we should take great care to make sure they can use it. Countries supporting this cause should really unite around it.  As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently said  “Countries do not become fit for democracy; they become fit through democracy.”   Democracy means freedom and equal rights for everyone. It provides opportunities to empower women. Women represent 50 per cent of the world’s human capital. It is in every country’s own interest to ensure that women take an active role in society and   17 11-51390  the economy as well as in the political process in the political power structures. I am convinced that in free and fair elections  extremists who want to take away women’s rights will not succeed.   Real democracy also means that the rights of religious groups  including Christians  are respected. Society as a whole should be tolerant towards those with other religions and beliefs. There should be no doubt about that.  Freedom offers the best route to prosperity. The ongoing global economic crisis is affecting prosperity everywhere in our world.  Enabling free trade is vital to economic recovery. Market access is crucial for private sector development. Breaking down the barriers to trade in agricultural products can galvanize entrepreneurship in the countries that really need it the most. The Arab region in particular should benefit from enhanced export opportunities to the European Union.   The beauty of well-regulated free trade is that it is not a zero-sum game; it benefits everyone and it is part and parcel of freedom. This is why the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round must succeed. The world should not and cannot revert to protectionism. The WTO has an important part to play in preventing this. The European Union is also ambitiously negotiating free trade agreements with various partners. Of course  these agreements should fit within the multilateral system.  Free trade leads to economic growth  which in turn should also benefit the poorest countries in this world. To further support their growth  we should enhance their access to education  vocational training and microfinance for women and the poor.  Freedom belongs to us all. Those who have fought to gain their freedom will never give it up. Freedom must be supported through security  democracy and the rule of law  and prosperity. We can achieve this through the efforts of Member States. Since the United Nations is the international forum where global issues and actors come together  it is here at the United Nations that we must join forces. We are witnessing international developments unfolding more rapidly than ever before. The United Nations needs to adapt to maintain its important role in international relations.  For that matter  the Security Council should better reflect changing international relations and economic realities. The Netherlands supports a modest enlargement of the Security Council  but with a limit on the right of veto in order not to undermine the effectiveness of the Council’s decision-making process.  The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s drive for budgetary discipline. We have to make careful choices about what to finance and what not to. I also urge emerging economies to take their share of responsibility for the sustainability of United Nations funding.  The United Nations has an essential role in fostering the rule of law around the world  as well as in preventative diplomacy and mediation. The Netherlands will play its part  including through the role of The Hague as the international city of peace and justice. The Peace Palace  the international courts and the legal institutions attest to our long tradition of international law and active role in its practice. That tradition  may I say  goes back to Grotius’s early seventeenth-century Mare Liberum  which laid the foundation for international law.  I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. I call on him to use the overwhelming support for his second term as a mandate to reform the United Nations. A strong and active United Nations is essential in a world in which no country can shape the future single-handedly. To succeed  public support for the United Nations is crucial. Clear and tangible results are necessary to sustain the commitment of Governments to the United Nations. An effective and efficient United Nations is in the national interests of all its Member States  and is  indeed  essential for freedom throughout the world.  Through our efforts at the United Nations  we can support the calls for freedom around the world. Then  on my next visit to Tunisia  Essma Ben Hamida  a strong-willed woman  can hopefully tell me that freedom has brought her both democracy and her rights and empowerment as a woman."
"130",5257,"NOR",66,2011,"Since we last met here  major changes have swept through the world. We have been witnessing the Arab Spring. People are standing up against authoritarian rule and demanding respect for the fundamental values that underpin this very institution. Autocrats who have failed to offer the prospect of a better life in freedom and dignity have been overthrown. Now  popular calls for reform in Syria have been met with a violent response. We urge the Syrian regime to respect the people’s legitimate demand for democracy and fundamental human rights.  In July  a new flag rose in Juba as we celebrated the birth of a new State. Last Friday  President Salva Kiir of South Sudan addressed us from this podium as the leader of our newest Member State (see ). That became possible thanks  first and foremost  to the vision and will of the people and leaders of the Sudan and what is now the Republic of South Sudan. However  it would not have been possible without the active support of the international community. That demonstrates the importance of mediation and the settlement of disputes through peaceful means.  Yet  we know that peace is fragile. The international community must coordinate its assistance and align it with the priorities of the South Sudanese Government. Outstanding issues must be settled through negotiations. We must contribute to laying the foundation for two viable States  so that they can both live in peace.  In Côte d’Ivoire and Libya  the United Nations has once again proved its worth by addressing some of the most challenging situations in the world. The resolve shown by the Security Council on Libya has reconfirmed its pivotal role in global governance and international security — the role that Member States bestowed on it through the United Nations Charter. There are times when there is no alternative to the use of force. When the Security Council acts  it is up to us — the Member States — to put its decisions into practice. Norway’s active participation in the military campaign in Libya was  first and foremost  an expression of our belief in a United Nations-led world order and in the principle of the responsibility to protect.  The response to Libya was also a landmark in terms of international justice. For the very first time  a unanimous Security Council chose to refer possible crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. Combating impunity and promoting the rule of law and fundamental human rights are key to the prevention of conflict and the protection of civilians.  Promoting and strengthening human rights and gender equality are a common responsibility. Failing to adhere to universally agreed principles in that area is simply not acceptable. Investment in and empowerment of girls and women so that they can participate fully in the political and economic lives of States are also essential for economic growth and prosperity. There is fundamental evidence that States that fail on that account and continue repressive and discriminating gender policies will remain poor.  Last year  we reconfirmed our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. We agreed to accelerate our efforts. Last week  we received new evidence of dramatic and positive breakthroughs in our quest to reduce child mortality and maternal deaths. Strong political leadership  new partnerships and    11-51681 20  innovative ways of working have brought real progress. The Secretary-General’s global initiative “Every Woman and Every Child” has been instrumental in this respect. But further progress must not be taken for granted. Norway will continue to focus on women’s rights and promoting the role of women in development. We will strongly oppose any efforts to reverse progress. We must maintain our resolve to implement the Beijing Platform for Action.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have proven to be a formidable tool for improving the lives of millions of people. Yet much remains to be done. There are vast untapped resources within many of the countries that are struggling to achieve the MDGs. Broadening the tax base  making tax collection more effective  halting illegal capital flows and fighting corruption are all measures that must be fully used in the fight against poverty. Getting that right will also improve the social contract in countries emerging from poverty or conflict. This is a responsibility that lies firmly with individual States.   With the climate conference in Durban only two months away  we must all play our part in making it a success. Implementation of the Cancun Agreements is crucial. The Green Climate Fund must be made operational. Durban should provide a roadmap that can bridge the gap between Kyoto and a new and more ambitious climate regime that includes all major emitters.  Today  1.4 billion people lack access to affordable and reliable electric power supplies. We must combat climate change while promoting development. The Secretary-General’s call for sustainable Energy for All is therefore highly welcome. Together with partner countries  Norway will launch a new energy initiative this autumn. The purpose is to boost sustainable energy generation and accelerate change towards energy efficiency. New funding will promote incentives for the energy sector in partner countries. Such incentives will in turn attract fresh capital for energy projects. We are determined to ensure concrete progress in Rio on the access-to-energy agenda.  Now  20 years after the United Nations first Conference on Sustainable Development  the nations of the world must renew the partnership for sustainable development. Civil society and the private sector are crucial in this partnership. Norway is committed to a successful outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.  Back in 1947  Norway voted in favour of the establishment of two States in the former mandate of Palestine in this Assembly. In 1949  we also heeded the call in resolution 181 (II) to give sympathetic consideration to an application by either State for admission to membership in the United Nations. We voted in favour of admitting Israel as a Member State. We based our decision at that time on the declarations and explanations provided by the Israeli delegation. Israel had persuasively explained why recognition and membership should not await resolution of the outstanding issues regarding borders  refugees  Jerusalem  and peace with neighbouring countries. When it admitted Israel as a Member State  this Assembly referred to those declarations and explanations.  Since then  Norwegian policy has been based on the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. Norway has consistently stood by Israel and its inherent right to self-defence in accordance with international law. We have also supported the Palestinian right to statehood and the building of the Palestinian Authority.  One of the main issues before this session of the General Assembly is the Palestinian quest for recognition. It is legitimate for the Palestinian people to turn to the United Nations under the current circumstances. This is neither incompatible with a negotiation process  nor an expression of unilateralism. Norway welcomes the call by the Quartet for negotiations on a comprehensive agreement on the outstanding final status issues to be completed within a year.  However  the situation on the ground is changing in several ways. A few days ago  the donor support group to the Palestinian Authority affirmed the success of local institution-building. The performance of Palestinian public institutions was scrutinized by the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. Their joint conclusion was that the Palestinians are fully capable of running a State.  On Friday President Abbas confirmed his commitment to resolving final status issues through negotiations. He also assured us of the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to complying with the United   21 11-51681  Nations Charter  relevant United Nations resolutions  democracy  the rule of law and human rights.  The main obstacle to full institution-building remains the occupation. Measures taken under the latter are changing the shape of the territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in ways that undermine negotiations and may soon render the two-State vision physically unattainable. The Security Council  the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice have all rejected the legality of such unilateral changes.  Both the Palestinians’ readiness for statehood and the declarations and commitments they have made should be acknowledged. Norway looks forward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations.  It is vital that we continue to improve and strengthen the United Nations  so that it can serve us effectively in times of change. We  the Member States  have not ensured sufficiently wide-ranging reforms. We have not equipped the United Nations with the resources needed to carry out the mandates we adopt. We define noble objectives  only to undercut them in the budgeting process. We continue to ask the United Nations to do more with less. If that is what we want  we must give the Secretary-General greater flexibility.  At times  the vision of a United Nations that delivers as one is undermined by our own interference and insistence on pet projects  earmarking of funds and cross-cutting  awkward and  on occasion  internally conflicting financial reporting requirements. Fragmentation does not begin at the United Nations. It is a reflection of the priorities and actions of Member States.  Before I conclude  let me make one last remark. We deeply regret that this podium has once again been abused to promote extreme views and unfounded allegations. This serves only to incite conflict rather than to bridge differences. We will not give up the authority of our presence in this Hall  but will rather confront such attitudes from this podium. The purpose of the general debate is to draw attention to current challenges  express and share our views and lay the basis for constructive dialogue.  In a rapidly changing world  the United Nations must be able to adapt to new challenges  new actors and new geopolitical realities. As the Secretary-General reminded us yesterday  with power comes responsibility. After all  the United Nations is only as good as the results it delivers. We are not judged by our words  but by our actions. "
"131",5303,"NPL",66,2011,"Let me begin by congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Let me also express our sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the strong commitment and dedication with which he has been serving the United Nations. We wish him further success in his second term.   Nepal warmly welcomes the Republic of South Sudan as the newest member of the United Nations.  It is a distinct honour and privilege for me to bring to the General Assembly the voice of the voiceless of the world. I have brought with me greetings from the nearly 30 million toiling  but proud  people of Nepal  who have recently liberated themselves from an age-old feudal monarchy and autocracy. Nepal is the enchanting land of Mount Everest  the top of the world. It is the birthplace of Gautam Buddha  the apostle of peace. It possesses an unbelievable variety of natural beauty and diversity.  In recent years  a momentous transformation has taken place in Nepal. After a long and persistent struggle  the feudalistic and autocratic monarchy has been abolished. We have entered into a new historic era with the creation of the new Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. Today  the new State apparatus strives to take into account the multi-ethnic  multilingual and multicultural diversity of the country. The abolition of all discrimination and oppression on the basis of class  gender  nationality  region and caste and the creation of an inclusive democratic system and a just society are at the heart of all our decades-long struggles. Thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of the thousands of martyrs of the historic people’s war of 1996 to 2006  the people’s movement of 2006  the Madheshi movement and many other oppressed people’s movements  we have come this far to lay the foundation of a new Nepal.   We must consolidate those historic gains and institutionalize them in order to establish sustainable peace  justice and prosperity for all. My Government is fully committed to doing that with the conclusion of the peace process and the writing of a new constitution through the Constituent Assembly at the earliest. The constitution will not only guarantee fundamental democratic norms and values  but it will also ensure that our multiparty democracy is inclusive  participatory and life-changing for all  especially the oppressed labouring masses and marginalized people. It is rightly said that the highest measure of democracy is neither the extent of freedom nor the extent of equality; rather  it is the highest measure of participation. We want to institutionalize a genuinely participatory democracy for all  particularly those who are downtrodden.  In that context  I would like to remind the Assembly of the poignant words expressed from this rostrum in 2008 by the Chairman of my party  the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist  and the then Prime Minister  Comrade Prachanda  about the landless peasants  the downtrodden women  the so-called untouchable dalits and the millions of exploited masses of Nepal  who aspire to liberation from all forms of oppression and exploitation.  Nepal’s home-driven peace process and historic transformation are unique and could be a good example for drawing lessons. We believe that transformation has to be holistic in order to have a long-lasting impact at the grass-roots level. Transformation in the political  social and economic fields has to be brought about holistically. It is attainable with dedication  dialogue and consensus-building among stakeholders. As in any other country  transitional pains and delays exist. However  we are united in our vision  and we intend to complete the transition process with the consensus and cooperation of all political parties and stakeholders. We are confident that  with international goodwill and cooperation  we will achieve it at the earliest.  Nepal’s foreign policy is based on the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter    21 11-51360  non-alignment and panchsheel and the promotion of regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. We would like to be a vibrant bridge between our two neighbours  India and China  and beyond. At a time when humankind is so much in need of peace and when we all strive for it  we particularly appeal for the development of Lumbini  the birthplace of Buddha  as the fountain of world peace through effective international support and cooperation. The International Committee for the Development of Lumbini needs to be reactivated at the earliest.  I extend sincere thanks to the United Nations  especially the United Nations Mission in Nepal  for providing invaluable support and assistance throughout our peace process. We are hopeful that we will continue to receive the goodwill and support of the international community in our efforts to institutionalize lasting peace  equity and prosperity in the country. The United Nations upholds the noble vision of peace and security  development  justice and human rights for all. But if we look around the world  we have a long way to go to achieve this. We still face conflicts  deprivation and demeaning poverty all around us. How can we achieve sustainable peace in the world when there is so much inequity  deprivation and marginalization around us? We have to deal with their root causes. How can one justify the spending of $1.5 trillion on war weapons every year while more than 2 billion people across the globe lack the basic necessities of food  medicine  et cetera?  In that context  I appeal to the United Nations to come forward with a far-reaching and comprehensive development package. We need a new Marshall Plan for the rebuilding and reconstruction of post-conflict countries. Lip service and symbolic support are not enough. It is now time for a bold  visionary step to deal with the complex problems of today that would be the most cost-effective approach to deal with global problems and ensure sustainable peace.  The principles and purposes of the Organization as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations represent the highest ideals of the global community. Yet we live in an age of paradox. The gap between the poor and the rich is ever-widening. Today  the level of inequality between States is the highest of any time in the past. Least developed countries (LDCs) — or  as I would prefer to call them  underdeveloped countries — are facing the full force of the negative side of globalization that is its deep structural constraints.   Growing joblessness is a major challenge for all of us. In this integrated world  the grinding poverty of the masses  who number in the billions  is a recipe for disaster. Islands of prosperity amid a sea of poverty are unsustainable  morally indefensible and economically undesirable. In a globalized and interconnected world  our destiny is inextricably intertwined. When my house is on fire  your house cannot be safe  and vice versa.  The recurrence of economic and financial crises  fuel and food crises and the deeper structural crises have vindicated the need to seriously review the current economic paradigm. I believe that now is the right time for deeper soul-searching and the creation of a new  just and scientific economic order. The new global economic order needs to deal with the current global volatility and the growing marginalization of poor and weaker economies. The financial  capital-driven globalization process is increasingly exposing its inherent structural deficiencies and its incompatibility. Unless the interest of labour  the basic source of human wealth  is duly integrated in this process  we may soon face the globalization of unrest and upheaval. The United Nations should act as the principal forum to examine that in a coherent  inclusive and holistic manner.  Least developed countries face severe structural constraints on their development efforts. Their vulnerabilities have been further aggravated by multiple crises. Despite some good progress in achieving individual goals  LDCs as a group are mostly off-track in meeting the internationally agreed upon development goals  including those contained in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). A rights-based approach to development is a must.  It is quite disheartening that even today about 75 per cent of LDC populations live in abject poverty and hunger. This situation is unacceptable and must come to an end sooner rather than later. Business as usual will not be a solution to deep-rooted problems. The historically structured process of “development of underdevelopment” needs to be structurally addressed.  The Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action must be implemented in their entirety and in an effective and timely manner. In particular  financing for development should be ensured as per the commitment that has been made. Duty-free  quota-free    11-51360 22  market access and supply-side capacity must be ensured to LDCs. Investment  technology transfer and private sector development should be promoted in LDCs. They are essential to achieving the legitimate aspirations of LDCs. A renewed and strengthened global partnership is critical to their implementation. We do not want to see another missed opportunity for LDCs.  Nepal  in its capacity as Chair of the LDCs  will make every effort  in cooperation with our fellow LDCs  to ensure that the issues and concerns of LDCs remain high on the priority list of the United Nations development agenda. Similarly  the special difficulties of landlocked developing countries should be recognized. Freedom of transit should be ensured to them as a matter of right  together with the scaling up of support for trade facilitation and infrastructure development.  Labour migration is a global phenomenon. We must protect the rights of all migrant workers and their family members to ensure that globalization is fair to all. As Nepal’s economy is increasingly dependent on remittances  that issue is very crucial for us.  Clearly  climate change has emerged as one of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century. Global warming has precipitated the melting of the snow in the Nepal Himalayas  a source of fresh water for over 1 billion people who live in South Asia. We have therefore taken the initiative of promoting the sustainable mountain agenda in order to highlight their special vulnerabilities and fragilities. Industrialized countries should bear greater responsibility for that.  There is an urgent need to make progress in climate negotiations and to ensure enhanced and predictable financing. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development summit scheduled for next year is critical to defining a more sustainable development path and to eradicating poverty for LDCs. The sustainable development agenda should encompass all ecological considerations  including the crucial issue of sustainable mountain development.  Nepal reiterates its call for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction in a time-bound manner. Nepal strongly believes that regional mechanisms complement efforts to promote the global disarmament agenda. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  located in Kathmandu  could be instrumental in revitalizing the Kathmandu process to facilitate dialogue and deliberations on confidence-building in the region.  Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and calls for an expeditious conclusion of the negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We should differentiate between terrorism and struggles for freedom.  Nepal’s commitment to human rights is deep and unflinching. We are fully aware that the protection and promotion of all human rights  including the right to development and fundamental freedoms  strengthens the sustainability of peace and progress. We have established an independent constitutional body — the National Human Rights Commission — as a watchdog institution. We are committed to building and strengthening that specialized national institution as a true custodian of human rights.  The General Assembly  which is the only universally representative body at the global level  needs to be given commensurate power and authority to truly work as a world parliament. It should not remain toothless. Similarly  Nepal supports the expansion in the membership of the Security Council in both categories. Reform must address all interrelated issues  such as representation  as well as transparency and accountability in the working methods of the Security Council. The role and contributions of smaller States in the maintenance of international peace and security must be duly acknowledged.  We underline the crucial role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for development. Its role in shaping the policy debate on  and establishing global norms in  economic and financial matters must be strengthened. Nepal welcomes all efforts aimed at promoting system-wide coherence  including the operationalization of UN-Women.  Nepal’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping is long-standing and consistent. We remain steadfast in our commitment to international peace and security. Nepal has already provided more than 80 000 peacekeepers  with 62 of our soldiers having laid down their lives in the line of duty. We would therefore like to call for equitable representation at the leadership level.   23 11-51360   In recent times  we have witnessed an outpouring of popular sentiment calling for change and freedom around the world. We believe that this is a sign of a new beginning  where people are asserting themselves as the masters of their own destinies. We applaud these changes. We should support them based on the fundamental principles of the United Nations. However  no one should hijack the agenda of democracy for partisan ends.  The long-drawn-out peace process in the Middle East is a matter of serious concern for us all. We must find a comprehensive and just solution to these problems. It is our principled position that we support a fully independent and sovereign Palestinian State based on United Nations resolutions. We look forward to its materialization at the earliest date.  Finally  let me reiterate that the United Nations principles must be holistic and should be pursued in a balanced manner. The United Nations should not only be the custodian of its noble principles; it must deliver on its promises. Let it not be a mere umbrella for the big Powers. In today’s globalized world  the United Nations has more responsibility than ever before for creating an inclusive and just global order. Let it not falter in its historic duties.  Let the United Nations serve the larger interests of the poor and the weakest segment of the international community. Let the economic transformation of the least developed countries with a rights-based approach be at the top of the United Nations agenda. Let the United Nations not fail the aspirations of millions of people for freedom  equality and prosperity. Let its vision be translated into a visible change in the lives of oppressed people. Last but not least  let us keep in mind that either we all reach the goal of global peace and prosperity together  or nobody will."
"132",5320,"NRU",66,2011,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Allow me also to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his capable leadership during the sixty-fifth session.  I would like to begin my statement by thanking Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his historic visit to Kiribati and Solomon Islands earlier this month. That was the first time that a sitting Secretary-General visited a Pacific island country  and it demonstrates his commitment to addressing the needs of all countries  no matter how small or remote. From my conversations with the Secretary-General  I know he left the region with a much clearer understanding of the special challenges we face as small island nations. I look forward to working with the Secretary-General on finding ways for the United Nations system to be more responsive to the unique and particular needs of small island developing States (SIDS).  While on his tour of the Pacific  the Secretary-General observed that   “Next month  the 7 billionth citizen of our world will be born. For that child  and for all of us  we must keep working to fight poverty  create decent jobs and provide a dignified life while preserving the planet that sustains us. That is why I have said that the sustainable development agenda is the agenda for the twenty-first century”. (see SG/SM/13780)  Sustainable development and poverty alleviation have been the overriding priorities of my presidency since I assumed office  in 2007. We have made great strides domestically  but we will still fall short of our ambitious goals until the international community chooses to create an environment in which all countries have the opportunity to realize their sustainable development aspirations.  Nauru’s culture and economy  like those of most Pacific SIDS  are heavily dependent on a healthy and productive marine environment. The ocean is the foundation of our food security and is a major source of Government revenue. It is for that reason that the Pacific SIDS are calling for the next Earth Summit in Rio to recognize the importance of the “blue economy” to small island and coastal States. I would like to thank Maldives  Australia and New Zealand  as well as the Secretary-General  for standing with the Pacific SIDS on this issue.  We have identified three priority areas for the Rio+20 outcome. First  we must enable SIDS to enjoy a greater share of the economic benefits derived from their marine and coastal resources. Secondly  we must reduce  and eventually eliminate  overfishing and destructive fishing practices. It is imperative that we ensure that our fisheries are sustainable. Finally  we must build up the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. Adopting our proposals would begin to create the space needed for small islands to thrive.   My Government is not sitting still while it waits for the international community to act. This past summer  Nauru’s application to the International Seabed Authority was granted  which will enable my country to engage in new and innovative ways to generate economic growth and move towards aid independence. Nauru is not endowed with terrestrial resources  and therefore has chosen to look to the oceans to expand its opportunities for economic and social development.   The proceeds from our exploration and development of copper  nickel and manganese resources will go to two fully Nauruan-owned funds  one that supports education and training  and the other  health and environment. This Nauru-controlled  domestically driven initiative will adhere to the highest international environmental standards.   15 11-51191   The sustainable development challenges of SIDS are widely recognized by the international community; however  our success in addressing them has been mixed at best. At last year’s High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals  it was determined that progress for most Pacific islands had been lagging in many areas. Targeted assistance to address the unique and particular vulnerabilities of SIDS is urgently needed. It is Nauru’s position that the most effective way to accomplish this objective is for the United Nations to recognize a formal SIDS category  with dedicated support mechanisms.  Unfortunately  all of our best efforts will have been for naught if we do not take immediate action to address climate change. As Pacific island leaders recognized earlier this month  climate change represents the single greatest threat to the livelihoods  security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific.  The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Durban  must make significant progress towards a comprehensive  legally binding agreement that can ensure the survival of all nations. The parties must agree to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol  so that new commitments are in place by 2013. The parties must also operationalize the agreements reached at Cancún  including more ambitious mitigation commitments and actions  the operationalization of the new Green Climate Fund  and a mandate to conclude a new legally binding agreement based on the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action.  Climate change threatens to undo all of our recent development gains if the major biggest polluters continue down the path of business as usual. Some Pacific islands may disappear entirely. It is an unfortunate reality that there is so much carbon in the atmosphere that many of the negative impacts of climate change may now be unavoidable. For that reason  Nauru applauds the recent open debate in the Security Council on climate change. While the final presidential statement was not as strong as we had hoped  it clearly recognizes the threat posed by climate change to international peace and security and lays the foundation for future work by the Council on the issue.   Few countries doubt the connection between climate change and security  but there is still disagreement as to the way forward. Allow me to reiterate the proposals of the Pacific SIDS.  First  the Secretary-General should appoint a special representative on climate and security to analyse the projected security impacts of climate change  so that the Council and Member States can better understand what lies ahead. Secondly  the Secretary-General should assess the capacity of the United Nations system to respond to the likely security impacts of climate change  so that vulnerable countries can be assured that it is up to the task. These two proposals represent the absolute minimum necessary to prepare for the greatest threat to international peace and security of our generation.  The Security Council must grapple with the most urgent security threats of our time if it is to remain relevant. Likewise  it should evolve along with emerging geopolitical realities and become more representative and inclusive. It is for this reason that Nauru supports an early reform of the Security Council through an enlargement of both the permanent and non-permanent categories and an improvement in its working methods.  We believe very strongly that new members should be geographically diverse. However  it is equally important that aspiring members demonstrate their commitment to addressing the most urgent security issues facing all Member States. As an example  I would like to highlight Germany’s bold leadership of the Security Council this past July  when it took the politically courageous decision to host the open debate on climate change. As I said earlier  climate change is the overriding security threat facing the Pacific region  and Germany’s efforts will not be forgotten.  In a similar vein  the United Nations should ensure that all citizens of the world have the opportunity to participate in its activities. We cannot continue to ignore the more than 23 million people who live in Taiwan  who have repeatedly demonstrated that they are a nation committed to peace and regional cooperation. We therefore support enabling Taiwan’s meaningful engagement in connection with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  The recent renaming of the Group of Asian States  to the Group of Asia and the Pacific Small Island Developing States  is a welcome change that    11-51191 16  exemplifies the inclusivity that should characterize all aspects of the United Nations system. I commend the Group for having taken this symbolic step and recognizing the 20 per cent of the membership that resides in the Pacific Ocean region.  However  we must move beyond symbolism to concrete action that addresses the actual concerns of small and vulnerable countries. Once again  I implore the Assembly to support the appointment of a special representative on climate and security for the benefit of the many nations around the world for whom climate change is a grave and  in some cases  existential threat.  My Government is preparing for a new challenge. In 2012  Nauru will assume the chairmanship of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). I would like to recognize the Government of Grenada for its inspirational leadership and able execution of a supremely difficult task.  I am humbled by the trust placed in us by our fellow AOSIS colleagues and have no illusions regarding the enormity of the challenges that lie ahead. We are entering a period in history when countries are turning inward  despite decades of evidence that cooperation is the surest path to prosperity. We must resist the urge to engage in zero-sum politics and recommit to the principles of multilateralism enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Durban will be the next opportunity to embark on a more sustainable path and create a world we are proud to leave for future generations. We should not let this opportunity slip away.  For years  leaders in the Pacific have implored the peoples of the world to come to our islands and see the impacts of climate change for themselves. The Secretary-General answered our call  and now he truly understands the urgency of our situation.  Earlier this week  he spoke of a little girl named Tamauri he met while in Kiribati (see ). Frightened by the rising tides around her islands  she asked what the United Nations could do to help her people. She is not alone. The children in all of our countries — Cook Islands  Fiji  Micronesia  Palau  Papua New Guinea  the Marshall Islands  Niue  Samoa  Solomon Islands  Tonga  Tuvalu  Vanuatu and my own  Nauru — wonder whether they will have a future. I look forward to working with the Secretary-General to meet the challenge of the climate crisis so that we can tell them that they no longer need to be afraid. May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations."
"133",5367,"NZL",66,2011,"As we say in Maori  to all peoples and to all voices  greetings  greetings  greetings to all.  I speak at the end of a period of intense United Nations dialogue and engagement. This year’s general debate provides unparalleled opportunities to reaffirm the unique multilateral role of the United Nations. And there has been much to debate. The events set in motion by a single Tunisian street vendor have transformed much of the Middle East and North Africa. People have displayed extraordinary courage in claiming their rights and freedoms. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will not be easy; it will not be quick; but it must be achieved.  For others  the struggle continues. We still look for change in Yemen; we still look for change in Syria. Other challenges are highlighted by this debate. We heard from the President of South Africa and others how the global community must move swiftly to avert humanitarian disaster in the Horn of Africa.  We heard from the President of Nigeria how terror networks threaten international peace and security  and from the President of Tanzania about growing piracy on Africa’s eastern coast  from Somalia to Mozambique. We heard calls from the Indonesian Foreign Minister for bold measures to avert a renewed global financial crisis  and we heard from the President of Brazil about the challenge of empowering women to participate in political decision-making.  As this debate has demonstrated  much more remains to be done. Lives have also been wrenched by natural disasters in many countries  including my own. On 22 February 2011  we experienced what my Prime Minister called New Zealand’s darkest day. An earthquake struck Christchurch  our second-largest city. A total of 181 people were killed  a loss we share with 15 other countries whose citizens also died. We were humbled by the support we received  and  once again  I thank those who gave that help.    11-51681 32   Despite that disaster and the literally thousands of aftershocks that have followed  New Zealanders remain resilient and optimistic. Christchurch is being rebuilt. Our economy is bouncing back and the country is returning to normal  not least by currently hosting the Rugby World Cup  a celebration of a game we love  in the country we love.   Despite some cause for economic optimism  the events of just the past week suggest that the world still faces what we have long feared: a second and even more disastrous decline into a double-dip recession. We do not relish the prospect of being dragged into another recession that is not of our own making. We caution others larger than ourselves against repeating the mistakes of the 1930s  when autarkic protectionism only deepened the Depression and led to war.  Instead  a successful conclusion of the Doha Round is one of the keys to prosperity  particularly for those of the global South. The February Christchurch earthquake was followed by the devastation wrought on our close friend and neighbour Japan. I reiterate our heartfelt sympathy to Japan  so steadfast in its support for New Zealand in our time of need. Those disasters  and others elsewhere  reinforced the importance of effective disaster preparedness  response and recovery.  New Zealand will work with the United Nations  non-governmental organizations and international agencies so that the lessons learned from Christchurch are shared with others so that those in regions as vulnerable as ours can be better prepared. Indeed  in those regions  disaster preparedness is no desktop exercise; it is a matter of survival.  Likewise  for our Pacific neighbours  another high risk  climate change  is no abstract threat  confined to thousands of pages of reports and esoteric debate; it is a fundamental question of existence. For the Pacific  climate change is a grave and present threat to livelihoods  security and well-being.  The Secretary-General experienced those challenges first-hand when he visited several Pacific States  including one post-conflict society  and another whose people see  on a daily basis  the dangers of rising oceans. He experienced real vulnerability when he saw that his hotel room  in addition to the towels and the telephone  was equipped with a lifejacket. And he saw the impact of rising oceans on the viability and survival of many communities when his plane had to be “wheels up” from the country’s airport — its major link with the world — before the tide came in.  Much more of that  and whole populations will be on the move  as they will be in other regions of the world as well  and that will have with implications for regional and international stability and security. Faced with that  it is self-evident that all relevant international forums  including the Security Council  must play their part in addressing the challenge. That means taking urgent and effective action on emissions reduction. It means strengthening adaptation in developing countries  particularly the most vulnerable. And it means acknowledging and planning for the security implications before they become threats to regional and international security.  This year’s Durban meeting must set us on the road to full implementation of the Cancun agreements. New Zealand is committed  both through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations and its active assistance in the Pacific and elsewhere  to integrate adaptation and mitigation measures into its development activities.  New Zealand also initiated the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Supported by more than 30 countries  the Alliance seeks to ensure that reducing agricultural emissions does not compromise global food security.  Increased agricultural productivity — the ability of many countries to feed themselves — is one of the great achievements of recent decades. Constraining agricultural production would put much of the world’s population at risk  and no country will do that. We must therefore maintain investment in agricultural research  so that productivity and efficiency gains can continue  but with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions. That is what the Global Alliance is all about.   New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. We are indigenous Maori; we are European; and we are the many peoples from the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere who now call New Zealand home. We are also proud to be part of the Pacific Islands Forum  the foremost regional body. For 40 years  it has been central to the region’s efforts to address its own problems  be they the special development challenges of small  isolated  vulnerable island States  or halting and healing the impacts of violent conflict. It has done that in the time-honoured Pacific way  through   33 11-51681  respectful dialogue and cooperation and then through joint action.  Three weeks ago  at the Forum’s fortieth anniversary meeting in Auckland  Pacific leaders honoured that legacy by agreeing on measures aimed at converting Pacific potential into Pacific prosperity.  The themes of their discussions will resonate in other regions: strong  sustainable economic growth  protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring that they are healthy and educated and that they can have long lives.  A key focus of that meeting was the alarming incidence of non-communicable diseases  a scourge that is rapidly encircling the globe. Almost half of all New Zealand deaths relate to cancer and heart disease  but the situation is even more critical in many Pacific island countries  where diabetes in particular approaches epidemic proportions. We thank those who brought that cause here to the United Nations  particularly the countries members of the Caribbean Community.  With the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) very much in mind  Pacific Forum leaders also focused on sustainable development. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to assess the progress made since the 1992 Conference  take its agenda forward and highlight best practices. For example  New Zealand’s aid programme includes energy  agriculture and tourism initiatives that promote sustainable development.  Pacific peoples were navigating their ocean  the world’s largest  at a time when others were still confined to their coastal waters. New Zealand Maori call the Pacific the ocean guarded by the god Kiwa. Our region is uniquely dependent on its ocean. For those who call the Pacific home  the “green economy” is in reality a blue economy. Our ocean underpins livelihoods  food security and economic development. That is why Pacific leaders have focused on ensuring its sustainable development  management and conservation. That is why they made addressing acidification  pollution and illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing urgent matters. That is why our leaders want us to work towards integrated ocean management  with our own Pacific Oceanscape framework as a very good model. And that is why they called for Rio+20 to recognize the Pacific’s economic and environmental significance  and its contribution to sustainable development. At Rio+20  we will seek the support of the United Nations for that blue economy.  We work to protect the health of people and their environment  but we must also enhance collective security by advancing the disarmament agenda. Over the coming year  we must focus on the full implementation of the action plan agreed at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. As coordinator for the New Agenda Coalition  a group of non-nuclear-weapon States committed to a nuclear-weapon-free world  New Zealand will soon introduce a draft resolution highlighting the work that will be required to achieve its implementation during the coming review cycle of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We commend that draft resolution for the Assembly’s consideration.  There have been gains over the past year with respect to conventional disarmament  but we have yet to see the results of those achievements. There has been pleasing progress towards an arms trade treaty  but hard work remains. Next year’s Diplomatic Conference must deliver a treaty establishing the highest possible common international standards for conventional arms transfers.  We must also maintain focus on small arms and light weapons  which for many regions are their weapons of mass destruction. The year 2011 marks the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. There has been much to celebrate  including the first Open-Ended Meeting of Governmental Experts on the implementation of the Programme of Action  which I had the honour of chairing in May. But next year’s Review Conference must work to ensure that the Programme delivers on its potential for keeping communities safe from such weapons.  To deal with all of that  we need a strong  nimble and effective United Nations  and we need a Security Council that reflects geopolitical realities — realities that have changed since 1945. Today  some States might credibly seek a fuller  longer-term Council role. New Zealand supports change that acknowledges those realities.  But most United Nations Members are not major or emerging Powers  they are small States. They too are crucial to the universality and legitimacy of the    11-51681 34  United Nations; they too must contribute at the Council table. Let me put it simply: if we reform the Security Council to provide a fuller  longer-term role for emerging Powers  we must also ensure a role for small States. Speaking as a small State  I say that we are the United Nations. And so we agreed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago when he said that the smallness of a country is not a deterrent to the realization of big dreams (see )  and with the Prime Minister of Cape Verde  who told us that small States must have a greater voice in international decision-making (see ).  There are real risks if we cannot achieve genuine Security Council reform. Emerging Powers will be denied a role consistent with their global significance  and small States will continue to be squeezed out of positions of responsibility. It is in everyone’s interests that the Security Council be more representative. As we saw earlier this year with respect to Libya  the Council is an extraordinarily powerful instrument for maintaining international peace and security. But with extraordinary power comes extraordinary responsibility — responsibility that must be exercised with regard for the views of all countries  large and small.  The Council must also build on its partnerships with regional groups  such as the African Union  which increasingly plays a critical role in maintaining regional and global peace and security. Recognizing the importance of closer relations with Africa  we are encouraging New Zealand investment in and trade with Africa  supporting peace and security and providing development assistance. Last week  we increased our diplomatic engagement by appointing a dedicated ambassador to the African Union and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.  New Zealand is proud of its history of active contribution right across the United Nations agenda. We have a strong record as an independent and   principled voice advocating collective security and the rule of law. We take an even-handed approach to security issues  as has been shown by our voting record and our tangible contributions to peace processes. We take seriously our international responsibilities.  That is why  in 2004  we announced that we would seek a non-permanent Security Council seat for the 2015-2016 term. Nearly 20 years have passed since New Zealand’s last time on the Council. The time is right for us to again bring the fresh  independent perspective of a small Asia-Pacific country to the Council. That candidature  which I confirm here today  is based on the belief that States  large and small  have a place at the Council table. Modern New Zealand was founded on a compact  a treaty-based partnership with its indigenous Maori people. That  and our diversity  means a unique history and perspective on promoting tolerance and conflict resolution; a perspective that we have previously brought  to good effect  to the Council table  and which we will bring again.  For the United Nations  2011 has been a truly historic year. The Organization has quickly responded to change in the Middle East and North Africa. It stands ready to provide post-conflict support  and not just in Libya. It has been critical to relief in the Horn of Africa. Its essential role in State recognition has been at global centre stage. Even the most cynical  the most jaded  have had to relearn that the United Nations is at the epicentre of much that happens  and much that matters. We need the United Nations. We need it to address the woes of the world and to consolidate its successes. Its fundamental importance stems from its universality  its legitimacy and its mechanisms to confront challenges. Its effectiveness depends on its ability to adapt as those challenges emerge and on its ability to address them together. Member States  large and small  come together in that collective endeavour. New Zealand  as always  stands ready to play its part."
"134",5411,"OMN",66,2011,"We are pleased to sincerely and warmly congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and to his brotherly country  Qatar  with which we share deep fraternal relations. We are confident that his diplomatic experience  especially in the field of multilateral diplomacy  will have a great impact on the success of this session. We wish also to express our appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  for his successful efforts in the conduct of the previous session. We also extend our congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the international community’s renewed confidence in him  as evidenced by his re-election to his post for a second term  so that he can continue his efforts to revitalize the role of the United Nations and further develop its work.  Each year  when we address the Assembly from this rostrum  we begin by presenting the issue of the Palestinian people. The international community has worked to encourage negotiations between the Palestinian National Authority and the Government of Israel  the occupying Power. Unfortunately  the situation remains at a standstill. For that reason  the global community  and the United Nations in particular  should act to fulfil its responsibility to find a just and comprehensive solution. We believe that the establishment of a Palestinian State on the basis of the borders of 4 June 1967 and the recognition of that State as a Member of the Organization will undoubtedly lead to serious negotiations aimed at reaching a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Brotherly Somalia has been the victim of a decades-long civil war caused by a weak leadership that failed to reach a political consensus to end that hateful war. We believe that  to save the Somali people from the threefold threat of poverty  ignorance and famine  the time is ripe for the United Nations to intensify its efforts  in cooperation with regional organizations  including the League of Arab States  the African Union  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development  to devise a plan to bring peace to Somalia. We would also stress the importance of increasing the provision of humanitarian assistance to the millions of Somali refugees and displaced persons. We are confident that Somalia’s neighbours share our belief in the need for political solutions to the chronic crisis in that country. We also reiterate to the Secretary-General that we are fully prepared to support the efforts of the United Nations in that regard.  On 26 January 2011  my country submitted its periodic report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in the context of the mechanism for the periodic review of States’ reports. We in the Sultanate of Oman are satisfied that we have come a long way in terms of protecting human rights at all levels. We consider this a national and spiritual commitment aimed at achieving justice that also supports the dimension of a global culture of human rights protection.  Our contemporary world is witnessing profound changes in the demographic composition of the peoples of the world  as young people now constitute the majority of the world population. As they are the most ambitious group  capable of mapping the future  the international community should take this reality into consideration in the elaboration of all manner of plans in the economic  education and sustainable development fields.  As our region is experiencing such profound changes  we  like the rest of the world  believe that the aspirations of young people to a better and more secure world and decent livelihoods have prevailed and should be accepted and welcomed by all Governments. We in the Sultanate of Oman  in keeping with the instructions given by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said  have based all of our national economic and social plans on empowering young people to make maximum use of their potential to benefit from technology and to achieve a society characterized by prosperity and sustainable growth.    11-51384 52   Today’s world is facing numerous crises that make it imperative for the international community to work jointly to create conditions that are conducive to finding solutions. The world may be on the brink of a widespread food crisis  and many people live in fear of food shortages. Efforts must therefore be made at the international level to expand production through the cultivation of larger areas and the use of advanced technology to increase yields and to combat desertification in vulnerable areas.  The continuing global financial crisis obliges us to collectively rethink the principles underlying investment and international trade in order to reach appropriate solutions aimed at reducing the negative impacts of the crisis on countries and societies  particularly in the developing world.   An additional issue we must face is that of global phenomena such as hurricanes  earthquakes and the high level of environmental pollution  all of which lead to major human and economic losses. We believe that all countries  particularly the major industrialized countries  should join together to find a solution aimed at reducing industrial and environmental pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions based on modern technology in those fields.  In closing  we are hopeful that all countries will seize the opportunity offered by the current session to take practical steps and measures on all of the issues under discussion. We hope that the session will meet with every success."
"135",5458,"PAK",66,2011,"I am honoured to be here today and to represent the brave and resilient people of Pakistan before the Assembly. As participants may know  the Prime Minister of Pakistan  Mr. Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani  was due to visit New York and address this House. Unfortunately  the Prime Minister could not come owing to the humanitarian disaster caused by the floods in Pakistan. Once again  I feel privileged to be able to deliver the remarks of the Prime Minister to the General Assembly.  I bring to Mr. Al-Nasser and to all the nations of the world assembled here salaam  peace and the greetings and good wishes of the people of Pakistan. We are delighted to be able to address the General Assembly under the leadership of Mr. Al-Nasser. This is an important session of the Assembly  and the State of Qatar is a truly deserving and able country for this occasion. The Pakistani people have intimate  brotherly relations with his great country  and I speak for my people in welcoming his presidential term. His election to this high office is as much a tribute to his outstanding qualities as it is to the high esteem in which his country is held in the comity of nations.  Why are we here? Other than the allure of New York City  why have we converged at the General Assembly? Pakistan is here because it believes in multilateralism. Each September we return to this great city and this grand stage so that we can restate and reaffirm the principles and values of multilateralism. It is and has been one of the abiding central tenets of our foreign policy. We are committed to the very idea of the United Nations.  To us  the idea is very simple. We can do more together than we can apart. We can solve complex problems by consensus rather than through unilateralism. Multilateral cooperation can help us deal with the spectrum of global challenges  old and new  in our interdependent world. As we grow more and more dependent on one another  the space for unilateralism and unidimensional answers to the most difficult questions shrinks. Those who are sceptical of the future of multilateralism are living in the past. The future  our collective global future  is  God willing  bright. It is the United Nations and multilateralism that will safeguard that future.  Pakistan believes in the promise of the United Nations: a world free from the scourge of war; a world governed by rules and norms of civility  of decency  of goodwill; creating a better future for the peoples of the world; and inter-State conduct premised on the respect for the immutable principles of the United Nations. We must ensure that the United Nations is the best representation of the aspirations of our peoples.  We must do better. There is far too much distance between those aspirations and the sometimes dark realities of our times. We are constantly struggling with difficult choices and cycles: expediency versus values  interests versus ideals. There is conflict  discord and death. Natural and man-made calamities spread fear and destitution among millions  and often exacerbate and expose already unacceptable levels of poverty and deprivation. We face these challenges in every country. We cannot afford to face them alone. The importance of togetherness and of our faith and collective commitment to the ideals  principles and values of the United Nations cannot be overstated.  Togetherness  or multilateralism  of course  does not mean uniformity or conformity. It does not mean falling in line. Instead  it means harmony  tolerance  respect for diversity and a pragmatic  cognitive realization that no one system  no single prescription  no one raah  or path  works for all. Each society  every culture offers a path for the march of mankind. Preconceived assumptions about the superiority of one way or the other must not be allowed to contaminate the spirit of the United Nations.   7 11-51681   Pakistan’s oldest spiritual traditions and most beloved poets and peers have taught us that there can be no progress where the mind is divorced from the heart. Faith in the United Nations is a manifestation of the best rational traditions and the most cherished traditions of idealism and believing in something. We believe in the United Nations. The spirit of the United Nations must permeate all our endeavours. The peoples of the world await the advent of the true age of the United Nations. We must reassert our promise to deliver it.  I would like to compliment the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his tireless efforts in bringing to bear the vast reservoir of goodwill  compassion and common humanity of Member States in successfully addressing a wide array of challenges.  On behalf of the people of Pakistan  I wish to convey our grateful thanks to the Secretary-General and the international community for their support and solidarity  expressed so generously in the wake of the devastating floods last year.  This year again  heavy monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding. Millions have been affected  with about 5.4 million people rendered homeless. Human and economic losses  as well as the pressing requirements of relief and rehabilitation  obliged us to seek international assistance. We again thank the international community for its support and solidarity.  The Pakistani people continue to consistently demonstrate their immense reservoir of courage  forbearance and generosity. God willing  we shall overcome this misfortune through the same fortitude and resilience that our people have been blessed with.  At this session of the General Assembly  Pakistan is seeking election to a seat on the Security Council. In soliciting the support of President Al-Nasser  I wish to assure him that we would discharge our responsibilities with utmost dedication to the high ideals and principles of the United Nations.  Pakistan attaches the highest importance to promoting the goals of peace  security and stability in the world. In our own region  we have relentlessly endeavoured to create an environment of shared prosperity and peace. A democratic  progressive and prosperous Pakistan embedded in a stable  secure and prosperous region guides the framework of our foreign policy and could yield enormous benefits not only for the peoples of our region but for those of the world as well.  We have reached out to our immediate neighbours with a sincere desire to join hands in bringing about durable peace and development through a win-win approach. Situated as we are on the crossroads of Central  South and West Asia  we realize the enormous opportunities that ensue from pursuing with diligence the vision of common development and cooperation.  I am happy to note that both Pakistan and India are now engaged in a substantive dialogue process that we in Pakistan hope will be uninterrupted and uninterruptible. We certainly intend to make that engagement fruitful and to premise it on the promise of a mutually rewarding enterprise that would enable us to make the best use of the complementarities that exist.  We look forward to resolving all outstanding issues  including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  which is among the oldest on the agenda of the United Nations and the subject of several Security Council resolutions. A peaceful resolution that accords fully with the aspirations of the Kashmiris is indispensable for durable stability  as is the need to safeguard their fundamental human rights.  The reality of a nuclearized South Asia imposes both on Pakistan and on India the onerous responsibility to work together to create mutual confidence  avoid an arms race and enhance strategic stability. We look forward to moving in that direction in the dialogue process.  Pakistan is also firmly committed to promoting stability and peace in Afghanistan. We respect and support the efforts of the Government of Afghanistan for reconciliation and peace  under the leadership of President Karzai.  We strongly condemn the terror attacks in Kabul  in which many precious lives were lost. We also express our sympathy to our brothers and sisters and the leadership of Afghanistan on the tragic assassination of Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani  former President and Chairman of the Afghan High Peace Council. Such cowardly attacks will never succeed in deterring our proud Afghan brothers and sisters from realizing the noble goals of reconciliation and peace.    11-51681 8   Pakistan fully supports an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned inclusive process of reconciliation and peace in Afghanistan. We want to see Afghanistan as a united  independent and sovereign State. We urge all concerned to join the reconciliation process. We also call for a de-escalation and cessation of violence.  The road ahead for peace in Afghanistan and our region as a whole is full of challenges. The complexity of the situation and the ground dynamics need to be analysed objectively and carefully. Clarity and strategic coherence  especially among Afghanistan  the United States and Pakistan  are of the utmost importance. It is for that reason that we attach importance to the work of the Trilateral Core Group. We also attach considerable importance to the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission for Reconciliation and Peace.  It is only by charting a clear road map that we will be able to bring about the necessary operational policy coordination to achieve our shared goals and objectives. Given the volatility of the situation  it is perhaps understandable that there is a high level of anxiety and emotion. However  we must not lose sight of the goals. We must work together closely and as responsible partners in a cooperative manner  and not rush to judgements or question each other’s intentions.   A cooperative endeavour  in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan  is the only way of ensuring peace  stability and prosperity in the region. Pakistan is willing to do its best with international partners and  most notably  the Governments of Afghanistan and the United States  to acquit itself of that high responsibility at this defining moment in one of the most important struggles of our times.  Pakistan has always upheld the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to an independent homeland with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Here  I would like to reaffirm our principled position. President Mahmoud Abbas made an historic and memorable case for his people (see ). We stand by him and the Palestinian people. We stand by our brothers and sisters  and we agree that the current situation is no longer sustainable. We support the quest of the State of Palestine for membership of the United Nations.  In North Africa and the Middle East  we have witnessed important developments. Pakistan believes that the aspirations of the people must be accommodated peacefully  without external interference and in a manner consistent with the principle of sovereignty  unity and the territorial integrity of States.  Very few countries have been ravaged by the monster of terrorism as brutally as Pakistan. We are keenly aware of the threat that terrorism poses to Pakistan  to Pakistan’s neighbours and to the rest of the world. Some 30 000 innocent Pakistanis — men  women and children — have been killed. The ever-valiant Pakistani armed forces have defended Pakistan and the rest of the world  at the highest cost. Our troops have sacrificed 6 532 shuhada  or martyrs. Some 19 190 of our strongest  bravest and most honourable boys have suffered injuries. It does not stop there. We have seen 3 629 of our police and paramilitary personnel embrace shahadat  or martyrdom. Since 2002  10 720 of those men and women of the police and paramilitary services have been injured.   The grieving mothers  daughters  sisters and wives of those brave men and women are a constant reminder of our need to be vigilant and to fight the menace of terrorism. Pakistan’s most popular leader  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  was assassinated in 2007. Numerous politicians have lost sons  brothers and fathers at the hands of terrorists. Our streets are filled with armed police posts. We cannot enter our parks  shopping centres  churches or mosques without being searched and frisked. Terrorists have attacked our military installations  the grave sites of our spiritual leaders  our minorities and the very idea of Pakistan. If I began recounting Pakistan’s sacrifices and suffering  I would be here till next September. We do not take terrorism lightly. We cannot afford to. We have suffered far too much at its hands.  Our nation is united in its determination to eliminate the spectre of terrorism from our soil  our region and the world. It is important to enhance international cooperation to totally obliterate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Our resolve is inspired by Allama Muhammad Iqbal  the legendary poet philosopher  to whom Pakistan owes a debt of gratitude. Iqbal said:  “The eagle does not fall from its soaring height  If you have the will  there is nothing to fear from adversity”   9 11-51681   Pakistan has the will. We do not fear adversity. It is Pakistan’s firm determination not to allow any space on its territory for militants and terrorists. On the regional plane  we must all pledge that our respective territories will not be allowed to be used by terrorists against others.  The issue of organizing  financing  arming  supporting and abetting terrorist violence needs to be addressed seriously and effectively. Notable success against Al-Qaida and its affiliates has been registered in recent years. It is well known that  following the Tora Bora bombing and consequent dispersal of Al-Qaida  it was Pakistan’s intelligence and security agencies that interdicted a large number of Al-Qaida operatives. Very recently  Yusuf Al-Mauritani  the chief operative of Al-Qaida  was arrested in a joint Inter-Service Intelligence and Central Intelligence Agency operation.  We must demonstrate complete unity in ranks  avoid any recrimination  build greater trust and  more important  bring about the requisite operational coordination in combating the menace. Otherwise  I am afraid that terrorists are the only ones who will gain. Eliminating terrorism is in our national interest. We believe that our success is critical to regional and global peace and security.  Despite our limited capacity and constraints  we have done all that we can towards realizing the vision of a bright future for our people and the peoples of Afghanistan and the region. We have actively advocated and worked for closer regional economic integration. We believe that  unless we prioritize development and create win-win scenarios in terms of mutually beneficial joint ventures in connectivity  infrastructure  energy and trade  we cannot succeed in changing the picture. We need to give hope and provide a silver lining to those who have not seen peace for three generations and have only taken up mercenarism and guns as a means of livelihood.  Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terror and militancy is irrevocable. We believe that action to that end warrants a comprehensive approach that deals not only with the violence  but also its root causes. That requires enhancing international cooperation in multiple domains.  Pakistan has reached out to all countries of the world to establish mechanisms and arrangements  including intelligence cooperation  mutual assistance in legal and criminal matters  and joint operations where required. We believe that is a global issue which needs to be addressed effectively.   Pakistan supports initiatives to strengthen the United Nations. However it is important not to start anything that could prove divisive or potentially unravel the essential pillars of the United Nations. The process of Security Council reform must be carried out in a manner to reinforce the confidence of the world’s peoples in that body and enhance its credibility and effectiveness. Such reform must enjoy the full consensus of the international community and accord with the fundamental principle of sovereign equality.   I remain committed to the vision of Pakistan’s martyred leader  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  who reminded us time and again that selective morality is by definition  immoral  and that fundamental human values alone must guide our actions.  Pakistan attaches high importance to United Nations peacekeeping functions and is a major troop-contributor to United Nations peacekeeping. Pakistan has consistently been among the top United Nations peacekeeping contributors for many years. We have over 10 000 troops in the United Nations Blue Helmets.  We also attach importance to United Nations work in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. Our collective endeavours in those fields would show more effective results if we could enhance security for all through non-selective and non-discriminatory approaches. Normative work must be premised on principles.  We applaud the work of the United Nations in multiple domains. The specialized organizations  bodies and institutions are veritable examples of accomplishments based on shared goals and broadened fields of cooperation. Pakistan played a leadership role in conceiving and piloting the One United Nations Initiative. That is a potentially vital actor in global development and aid effectiveness. Despite the Paris Declaration and its reaffirmation at Accra  we have a long way to go. The One United Nations Initiative in Pakistan has struggled to achieve the lofty goals that it set  but we continue to invest hope in its eventual success.  Of course  the most important kind of harmonization is the one that takes place between    11-51681 10  people  between hearts and minds  between nations. We place immense importance on our ability to promote harmony and tolerance among and between societies  cultures  faiths and nations. We know the price to be paid when those values are breached  having lost the Governor of our most populous province  Salmaan Taseer  and our valiant Minister for Minority Affairs  Shahbaz Bhatti  to acts of violence perpetrated by extremists. For us  the process of harmony and tolerance begins at home  and we take it very seriously. We are committed and our resolve is strong.  At the international level  we are confident that the United Nations provides the best global forum  as it is fully equipped to enhance understanding and goodwill among all members of the international community. Respect for beliefs  cultures and traditions are the hallmark of civilized conduct. We are particularly concerned over campaigns that tend to stigmatize Islam and Muslims. Islam is a religion of peace. It is important that the international community celebrate our common humanity and unity in diversity.  The systemic fault lines in the global economic landscape have surfaced lately and remain a source of immense concern. The debt and financial crisis added another worrying dimension to the existing disparity between developed and developing countries and highlighted the need to promote holistic development and economic growth. That requires revisiting the fundamentals and readiness to equitably address the underlying issues.  As a democratic country committed firmly to the ideals  values and principles of the United Nations  Pakistan will continue to do its best for the cause of global peace and prosperity. Under the leadership of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani  the Pakistani nation is moving ahead  confident of itself and its enormous capabilities. As a vibrant democracy  we are in the process of accomplishing a historic societal transformation. The challenges our people have dealt with have empowered and emboldened us further.   We will remain unflinchingly democratic. We will defeat those that seek to terrorize us. We will empower women. We will protect the weak and the vulnerable in our midst  especially minorities. We will stand up for the weak and vulnerable abroad. We will support the human rights of Kashmiris. We will speak in support of the Palestinians. We will educate our children. We will protect our children. We will face any and all challenges with determination and faith. Most of all  we will be a peaceful and prosperous society. There will be challenges  but we will overcome each one of them.  We do not anticipate undertaking that alone. With our neighbours and our friends  we will undertake it all  in a spirit of togetherness and of harmony. We will forge ahead despite the darkness of our times in the spirit that helped to build this great institution. That spirit speaks to the very heart of Pakistan’s identity — it is the spirit of the United Nations. Let us join hands and march forward  for the good of the peoples of our countries and for the good of the world.  I will conclude my statement with the words of Pakistan’s founding father  Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah  which is the quintessential expression of Pakistan’s foreign policy. Mr. Jinnah stated  in a radio broadcast of February 1948:   “Our foreign policy is one of friendliness and goodwill towards the nations of the world. We do not cherish aggressive designs against any country or nation. We believe in the principle of honesty and fair play in national and international dealings and are prepared to make our utmost contribution to the promotion of peace and prosperity among the nations of the world. Pakistan will never be found lacking in extending its material and moral support to the oppressed and suppressed peoples of the world  and in upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter.”"
"136",5501,"PAN",66,2011,"It is an honour for me to address the international community  first of all  to express the pleasure of the Government of the Republic of Panama at the election of His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  The delegation of Panama is gratified by the holding of the general debate in the presence of the Secretary-General and representatives of the different Member States  Observers and organizations. We would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session for his excellent work.  President Al-Nasser has invited us to focus this debate on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution. The importance of this theme invites us to deeply reflect on its multiple dimensions  given that mediation is an essential instrument in the preservation of international peace and security.  Panama is a multi-ethnic country where people of different races  cultures  creeds and languages coexist in harmony and freedom  and where love of representative democracy  independence and respect for the sovereignty  ideology and territorial integrity of all countries are inalienable specific qualities that define us as a nation.  In our view  and as a founding member of the United Nations  Panama will always advocate for international peace and security  the promotion of dialogue among Member States  the strengthening of multilateral dynamics and facilitating the mission of the United Nations. That is largely due to experiences accumulated during the course of the diplomatic history of our country. More than three decades ago  for a second and last time  the Security Council held an extraordinary session away from Headquarters  with the purpose of politically mediating the dispute over the sovereignty of Panama over its Canal and the territories adjacent to the Canal Zone  controlled at that time by the United States of America  which was the platform that launched the Panamanian cause onto the international stage.  It was the joint will and intervention of the members of this illustrious General Assembly  demonstrated in its historic resolution 31/143  of 1976  which to a great extent inspired the signing of the Treaties between Panama and the United States in 1977. Nowadays  the Panama Canal  fully under our sovereign authority  is one of the most important axes of our economic development  supervised by a Panamanian administration  for the benefit of all nations. Panamanians will always be grateful to the United Nations for this noble success of multilateralism.  In the 1980s  the Contadora Group was established in Panama as a mechanism for multilateral mediation. It forged a Latin American alliance committed to democracy  economic cooperation and regional security and led to the Esquipulas peace agreement — an overarching advance in the consolidation of peace in Central America. The Contadora Group was the predecessor of the Rio Group  which is today an important mechanism for consultation and coordination in Latin America.  When our democracy was restored in the early 1990s  with the support of the United Nations Development Programme  we as a nation initiated sustained consultations among the principal actors of Government and civil society in order to strengthen our administrative institutions  secure the return of the Panama Canal to Panama  overcome asymmetries in our country  and identify strategies to accomplish our development priorities.  During the past two decades  our culture of dialogue has given us the skills necessary to transform our country into a democratic and dynamic society that is progressing at a steady pace under the current Administration of the President of the Republic  Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal.  As a result  Panama is now considered the second most competitive economy in Latin America  according to the World Economic Forum classification system  in   17 11-51681  view of our first-class financial system  our ports  our high-quality multimodal logistics infrastructure and our efficient technology — all of this in an environment that is open to business and generates global interest in foreign direct investment.  Our robust prospects for economic growth and our effective management of public debt  in combination with continuous  adequate and careful financial discipline  have been the determining factors in our recently achieved investment grade with a stable outlook  according to the major rating agencies. Likewise  we have begun to implement an active cooperation agenda in the area of information exchange and fiscal transparency. We have adopted all of the measures suggested  which have enabled us to comply with the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in this respect. However  this journey to success has not been easy  and many future challenges remain.  I believe that all of those here today will take on the main challenges faced by the international community in the process of achieving a coherent restructuring of the world economy and the reform of its institutions and oversight mechanisms. Panama is fully aware of this need  and our international agenda requires us to participate actively in the major multilateral mechanisms and economic and commercial integration forums in the areas of investment  tourism and technology  for the benefit of our citizens. Panama believes that such efforts must be promoted without delay by the major economies if we truly wish to overcome the turbulence in international markets.  Our country also believes that to ensure a favourable economic climate  domestic conflicts must be prevented. This depends on  inter alia  the effectiveness of the democratic regime  public security  respect for human rights  the responsible management of natural resources  tolerance  access to health-care and sanitation services  the affordability of basic goods  good governance  and inclusive and balanced development.  We in Panama  after living for 21 years under a military dictatorship — until 1989 — have made a strong commitment to democracy as a means of peacefully resolving the disputes that arise in our society. The experiences suffered under that dictatorship have led us to speak out unequivocally  in bilateral and multilateral forums  in favour of the strengthening or re-establishment of the effectiveness of democratic institutions wherever necessary. This has led us to clearly express our position in defence of democracy in cases such as those involving Honduras  the failed coup attempt in Ecuador  and the Arab Spring  which brought the winds of freedom to that region of the world.  The duty to resolve disputes that give rise to international conflicts lies primarily with those States whose disagreements have generated the conflicts in question. Nevertheless  the United Nations  as the epicentre of global diplomacy  must increasingly perfect the art of mediation as a means of resolving international disputes. We can never forget that this is a fundamental principle of the Charter of the United Nations  enshrined in its Article 33 — a mandate that has resulted in many accomplishments around the world  where wisdom  mutual understanding and agreement have prevailed over aggression  hate and destruction.  Mediation and dialogue have formed the basis of the stand that Panama has taken in connection with conflicts that have a bearing on peace and international political stability. Allow me to point out in that respect that the Government of the Republic of Panama believes that the Palestinian people have the right to be recognized as a State  but that they must first resolve their differences with their neighbour Israel  which also has the right to peaceful and harmonious coexistence with Palestine and the other States of the region. There could be no better solution than one that emerges from direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.  We also trust in the outcome of dialogue between the parties in the case of China. Panama  with full respect for the existing diplomatic truce  calls for greater participation by Taiwan in international forums and initiatives  in recognition of the fact that its people wish to contribute to the pursuit of global peace and well-being.  For that reason  and given the relevance of this important provision of international law  we invite the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly to continue to promote and enhance the role of mediation as a viable strategy for the peaceful resolution of disputes.  However  for the United Nations system to continue its effective peace mediation activities  each    11-51681 18  Member State must honour the commitments undertaken  so that the Organization can count on sufficient resources. This call for international cooperation is particularly relevant in these times of budgetary constraints in many countries  and given that aggressive competition for scarce resources is one of the primary causes of armed conflicts.  Panama is a country with a lengthy and notable history of peace and conciliation. In our opinion  the best option when faced with the threat of armed conflict is comprehensive  transparent and unconditional diplomatic dialogue between the parties.  We welcome the fact that in July 2011 the international community marked an important milestone along the path to a collective security architecture through the unanimous adoption of a resolution entitled “Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution” (resolution 65/283). That consensus represents the victory of reason over the absurd and harmful option of confrontation. The international community has seen clearly the major advantages of investing in a concerted effort to consolidate peace before it becomes necessary to contain the human tragedies resulting from violent conflicts  as we have witnessed and are witnessing in Somalia  for instance  where hunger  disease and destruction reign.  Human history has taught us that hunger  poverty  ignorance  injustice and social inequality give rise to the greatest threats to peace and security. If we  the States Members of the United Nations  remain determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  we must opt for proactively ensuring a peace that is based not on action taken in reaction to political or military acts of aggression  but on faith in and guarantees of universal and equal human rights in all corners of the world.  As we believe in the valuable role that the United Nations should play  Panama is very proud to share with this Assembly the fact that the Government of President Ricardo Martinelli proposed the creation of a United Nations Regional Centre for Latin America and the Caribbean  with the aim of strengthening coordination and dialogue among regional agencies  in particular the 16 United Nations bodies already established in Panama. The national Government will finance the project  which will be a unique model of best practices in implementing sustainable development in Latin America and the world.  In the past decade  our country’s privileged geographic position and the logistical infrastructure that Panama City offers has attracted various humanitarian aid organizations. That has also encouraged Panama to promote the construction of a regional humanitarian assistance logistics centre for the Americas. The regional centre will have the necessary agreements to expedite the entry and exit of humanitarian aid in order to help in the event of natural or other disasters  such as occurred last year in Haiti  where the international humanitarian agenda is still very necessary.   With such projects  we reiterate our commitment to the multilateral system and to the United Nations Organization  and show that  as small lower-middle income developing countries  we also provide international cooperation  even in such times of economic difficulty for the large economies.  Nor does Panama wish to miss the opportunity before the Assembly to call for reflection on the environmental  political and social challenges that all our societies face and that we must overcome  once again  through dialogue and cooperation among States in an effort to address those global challenges.   Without a doubt  one of those great challenges is that posed by climate change and its effects. Climate change is a priority of my country’s foreign policy at the environmental level. We are committed to all efforts aimed at strengthening international environmental organizations and to the struggle to find joint solutions to the causes and effects of that phenomenon.  As part of our support to the Organization’s own initiatives and for the benefit of the international community  we will host the meeting of the ad hoc working groups of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  soon to take place in Durban  South Africa. Those working groups will meet in Panama from 1 to 7 October in order to advance the modalities for a second commitment period of carbon emission reductions by developed countries and for stabilization of the global temperature so as to make progress in fully implementing the Framework Convention through long-term cooperation mechanisms.   19 11-51681   Panama hopes that the meeting will serve as a bridge between the results obtained in the Mexico meeting and those that may emerge in the one that will take place in South Africa  since it is necessary to set clear  transparent and ambitious goals. Also  the political will of developed countries in the matter must be reaffirmed  as they have the primary responsibility under the Convention.  In conclusion  as the Secretary-General rightly stated in his opening address to the general debate:   “Saving our planet  lifting people out of poverty and advancing economic growth — those are one and the same fight.” (  p. 1)  That is why Panama  once again and before the General Assembly  renews its commitment to the community of nations to work for a world where war  sectarian hate  discrimination  intolerance and destruction waged under different flags and creeds that  without any justification  generate only poverty and misery  may finally be replaced by the dialogue  negotiation  cooperation and friendship stemming from differences that  on the contrary  have always been a source of wealth and well-being for the peoples of the world. "
"137",5548,"PER",66,2011,"I would first like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  and to assure him of Peru’s firm support in his task.  I would also like to say how pleased I am to be speaking to the world on behalf of the people of Peru from this rostrum that represents multilateralism  peace  solidarity and cooperation  the principles that inspired the birth of this Organization and that Peru fully supports.  The Government I head began its administration only a few weeks ago. Through the ballot box  the people of Peru entrusted us with the task of making a great transformation  one that we have sought for a good part of our history. We intend to make that commitment a reality  out of a sense of responsibility and honour. Our mythical and vibrant nation  possessed of an extraordinary past and a vigorous present  demands that we put an end to centuries of poverty and   13 11-50871  exclusion. The great transformation is a process of social inclusion  that is to say  of converting the economic growth that Peruvians have been experiencing for the last 10 years into development; in other words  we must turn money into quality of life.  Our ideal of the great transformation is as impossible to relinquish as is our democratic faith. My Government proposes to deepen our democracy  so that we can respond to the problems and needs of all  not just a minority. In other words  we will democratize democracy. Democracy is the basis of a people’s self-determination  and the State must be prepared to faithfully carry out the people’s will. That is the foundation of a sovereign democracy. In order to fulfil that commitment  the State must be the institution responsible for shaping the path to transformation through public policies in both the political and economic spheres. The State must act in the interests of the people.  The United Nations is the greatest guarantee we have for preserving peace  and it is made up of our States. Today  however  we know that there are companies that have as much power as or greater power than many States  and that can react rapidly via the networks of the Internet and the stock market to put States themselves in the dock of the accused. That situation must be taken into account in order to safeguard State policies concerning issues such as the preservation of the environment  respect for peoples’ self-determination and the rights of indigenous communities and social minorities  among others.  We cannot consider the possibility of transformation outside the rule of law and its values. This is not a question of copying others’ models. We will govern by consensus  both at home and abroad  protecting all our freedoms with tolerance and  above all  by listening to our citizens  without regard to class  race or gender. When I took office I quoted Nelson Mandela  who said that there is no democracy with poverty  and no democracy with social inequality. Our Government seeks a State that can regain the ability to promulgate policies that respond to the needs and aspirations of all its citizens. It is in that spirit that we are renewing our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals.  Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. Its political class cannot say that the dream of those who established our independence and founded the republics of today  has come true. In most cases  values such as liberty  equality and fraternity were the banners of our founders. However  extreme interpretations of those values have led to a world of great confrontations  without really advancing liberty or equality. Let us now strengthen fraternity as a path to lasting peace. In that regard  I would like  from this rostrum  to take the opportunity to recognize the Palestinian State and its right to live in peace and harmony alongside other countries of the United Nations.  Today the integration of a geographically fragmented and scattered nation is possible  thanks to advances in communications and physical infrastructure. Social inclusion also demands quality public services and equality of opportunity. Citizens need access to health  education  housing  decent jobs and social security. We are talking about full integration within Peruvian society. We are vigorously promoting exchanges between our communities  and we acknowledge and seek to re-evaluate our diversity.  We want a State that is responsive to the needs of its citizens and communities. That is its primary role. The exploitation of non-renewable sovereign resources  which Peru is rich in  should serve the country’s development. Investment projects should respect both the human and the natural environments in which they take place. This is already being made clear to investors through a negotiation process that my Government has undertaken within the framework of the rule of law. Thanks to those negotiations  the State and our communities will have greater resources available for social investment projects. That will enable us to promote social cohesion and democratic stability  and  at the same time  the more favourable investment environment that the country needs. One of the first measures we took was to enact a law on prior consultation  through which we can respond to the demands of our indigenous communities  involving them in decisions that concern them. In that way we are affirming that every Peruvian is a first-class citizen  and we are fulfilling a commitment made by Peru in compliance with Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization concerning indigenous and tribal peoples.  Drug trafficking is one of the world’s most serious issues. It is essential that we recognize the fact that this major problem has not been overcome; worse  its power and influence are growing every day.    11-50871 14  Acknowledging this reality is an important step  which will enable us to re-establish an integrated policy  working together with stakeholders and giving equal importance to both controlling supply and reducing demand. For Peru  these principles also involve States’ duty to act decisively and cooperatively in order to combat every link in that criminal chain. Coca production is a source of income for tens of thousands of people who cannot always rely on a viable alternative for survival. My Government is working to achieve a situation in which anti-drug policies lead to the eradication of illegal coca crops  and is also considering the need to include peasant farmers in alternative development programmes. Unless we do  eradication will simply be insufficient to achieve our objectives. We must act more vigorously in combating the transnational criminal organizations that are the main beneficiaries of this illegal trade. Those organizations employ thousands of people and exploit the poverty and vulnerabilities of States in areas where access is difficult.  At the same time  we require greater financial knowledge in order to detect money-laundering activities and more effective controls over supplies and precursors. In the context of security  we must control the supply of weapons that the cartels and criminal gangs use daily against citizens.  In the second quarter of next year  we will convene in Lima a meeting of ministers for foreign affairs  and heads of organizations responsible for combating drugs in order to address these issues and define specific measures. My Government will spare no effort in combating the drug trade and organized crime.   Peru is a multicultural country that is in the process of recognizing the wealth of its own diversity. For example  our country today is undergoing a gastronomical revolution that has revealed that diversity contributes to social inclusion and sustainable development. Peruvian cooking is an area in which all Peruvians — from the peasant and the cook to the fisherman and the tradesman — can participate together. It is based on a millennial dialogue among many cultures — indigenous  African  European  Arab and Asian — that is represented today in our cuisine. For that reason  we have called on UNESCO to recognize Peruvian cooking as a representative element of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.   Technological and scientific progress has grown exponentially over the past 50 years. Currently  however  there has been a parallel growth of global exclusion. This is seen not only in the lack of access to technology  but also in the mass migrations of people seeking better opportunities abroad. Those people  who are known as illegals  are in fact a bridge for integration. However  in many cases the needs that motivate them to move abroad lead to violations of their human rights. I take this opportunity to call for fairer and more dignified treatment for peoples who contribute through their work to the economies of their countries of origin and of residence. Their marginalization this will push them into informal economies run by mafias and criminal networks.   With respect to social inclusion  my Government is prioritizing the needs of the most fragile and vulnerable  such as children and the elderly. However  we are also concerned with the need to protect the rights of women  who have historically been victims of discrimination. In this regard  I note the positive decision to create UN-Women. We call on the international community to work together to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. We also reiterate our commitment to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference against Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  whose tenth anniversary we celebrate today.  The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are being felt in the most vulnerable social sectors yet affect us all  rich and poor alike. In the context of the global attempt to preserve the planet  we must all be committed. In Peru  we are working to promote the use of clean energy through reforestation  environmental education and recognition of the right of participation and access of communities that possess traditional knowledge. That will require a large amount of resources and technology that are more abundant in the northern hemisphere. Therefore  we reaffirm the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility between developed countries and developing countries. International cooperation must enhance the level of financial and technical assistance to mitigate the effects of climate change.  Industrialized countries must assume and fulfil the commitment to significantly reduce their carbon emissions. On 28 July in Lima  the Heads of States of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)   15 11-50871  called attention to the threats posed to our economies by situations that originated in the United States  Europe and Asia  linked to the high level of public debt and unemployment and the slow recovery of credit markets and investment. Of course  is the situation is also due to military ambitions that have diverted vast amounts of money that could have been used to prevent these crises.   Latin American countries are learning how to overcome our chronic vulnerability in the face of these crises. We have decided to work together  coordinating our policies to enhance the economic underpinnings of our countries and the monitoring of our financial systems. We have established the South American Council of Economy and Finance  reflecting our capacity to encourage dialogue and establish consensus to the benefit of all.   Latin America will not be spared the problems that have affected the North. We are making preparations. It is not enough to be linked to one another; we must be united. The twenty-first century may well be the moment for this part of the continent and its great market of more than 700 million people. Our commitment to integration  peace and regional progress is not rhetorical. For the Peruvian Government  integration with our neighbouring countries is a priority instrument for promoting security and development for all throughout South America and Latin America. This is in line with of the affirmation that the path to peace and reconciliation requires an end to the blockade on Cuba.   As Víctor Andrés Belaúnde said on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly in 1959:  “In centuries gone by  the arrogant will to power prevailed. Today mankind not only yearns to  but must  live in a world ruled by justice.” (A/PV.795  para. 33)  The interdependence of our societies is a fact. It is not necessary to create further divisions. When making decisions  we must learn to talk to one another and to involve the viewpoints of the many actors of the international system. Peru reasserts its full support for enlarging the Security Council to make it more representative and enhance its legitimacy.  It is urgent to also advance reform of the Economic and Social Council in order to make it a genuine  fundamental forum for the development of all peoples of the world.  The priority we give to regional integration in no way implies that ours is closed regionalism. That would be anachronistic in a globalized world. Although our foreign policy is based on brotherhood in South America and Latin America  we will not neglect our political  trade and cooperation relations with other regions of the globe. On the contrary  our regionalism will provide a platform to bring us closer  in a more articulated and proactive way  with other regions of the world.  Our participation in multilateral forums will increase in coherence. Global political stability requires intergovernmental organizations and strong regional groups that are capable of maintaining that multipolar order that is emerging in our world."
"138",5595,"PHL",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election and to offer the Philippines’ full support for his leadership in this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.  Our collective experience as one United Nations has brought into focus the reality that only when nations work together in firm and determined resolve can we begin to address the many difficulties that confront us. Two global wars exposed our vulnerability to leaders and nations that do not hesitate to use violence to resolve disputes and underscored the need for an international system to govern the behaviour of States.  That is the rules-based framework that underpins everything we want to build  raise and do as one United Nations. That framework — built on our shared values and common aspirations — provides the way by which we can effectively move together as one global community towards our common objectives. For the Philippines  therefore  this session’s theme — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” — is most relevant and opportune.   A rules-based system will work in a sustained manner only if the rules themselves are based on principles of justice and equity. Recent events across the globe  particularly in the Middle East  have shown us that individuals rise together for what they believe is just and equitable. Individuals clamour for the rule of law based on equity and fairness. When they realize the injustice of repressive and iniquitous rule  they do not hesitate to bring effective and positive change.   We must continue to work to eliminate nuclear weapons and curtail the illicit trade in conventional weapons and in small and light arms in order to preserve peace and our very existence. The successful 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons showed the collective resolve of States parties to move further forward in ridding the world of those weapons. We have already agreed to convene a conference by 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The holding of that conference will take us closer to our goal.   To build peace  we need to provide and strengthen conditions that encourage the full progress and prosperity of all nations and peoples. We must ensure that international trade and development support that end. The Philippines therefore calls for a fair  open and rules-based multilateral trading system    11-51687 2  and the conclusion of the Doha Round. We must likewise redouble our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The target date of 2015 is upon us and much work remains to be done. The Philippines is one of world’s 17 mega-diverse countries and has a great stake in ensuring that global biodiversity is protected and maintained. We have been described as the epicentre of global marine biodiversity  and we host the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity. As we look forward to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development next year  we join the call for a more powerful expression of the entire world’s political commitment to sustainable development.  With the human person at the core of all our efforts  we must always strive to uphold human dignity and human rights. That holds true for migrant workers. The Philippines has close to 10 million Filipinos overseas  contributing to global socio-economic development. In line with the rules-based approach  the Philippines supports the establishment of guidelines that would ensure the welfare of all migrant workers.  Additionally  we must renew our resolve to address the evils of human trafficking. The Philippines is a founding member of the Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking  an informal association of United Nations Member States that seeks to help reinvigorate and consolidate the global fight against trafficking in persons. At the core of the initiative is the implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.  Aside from establishing rules to protect migrant workers and to prevent human trafficking  the global community needs to explore measures to more effectively assist developing countries in evacuating their nationals in instances of disaster or internal conflict. The Philippines also supports efforts at the United Nations to enhance partnerships  including with private sector actors  in strengthening the international humanitarian and emergency response system.  The Philippines recognizes that the promotion and protection of human rights are of vital importance to securing peace and socio-economic development  promoting the rule of law and strengthening democracies. The Philippines Government likewise recognizes women as agents of socio-economic growth and change  and thus strongly advocates their full participation in nation-building.  The Philippines is pleased to announce that  on 30 August  we deposited our instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This was an historic moment for my country and my people. We have stood up against the impunity of colonial rule and of a dictatorship. Now  we stand together with the rest of the world in saying “never again” to impunity in any corner of our world.  Firm in the desire to contribute to global efforts to safeguard the world against impunity  the Philippines has fielded a candidate for election to the Court  Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago  an experienced trial judge and international legal scholar with a distinguished and long career in public service. We ask all our partners and friends to support her candidature.  As we look to strengthen the ramparts of peace  we recognize the important role and contributions of United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The Philippines stands ready to do its part to ensure that the lines of peace are fortified and continuously expanded. The Philippines lauds the heightened interaction and dialogue among the Secretariat  the General Assembly  the Security Council  troop- and police-contributing countries and other key stakeholders in the global peacekeeping agenda.  As we strive to reinforce peacekeeping operations on land  so too should we continue to exert efforts in maintaining stability and security at sea. Maritime piracy  after all  imperils the lives of seafarers and disrupts global trade. Today  around 70 Filipino seafarers are still being held hostage by pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian Ocean. We must continue to work diligently to counter these sea pirates  who have no place in our modern  civilized world.   To strengthen the international rules-based regime  the Philippines advocates reforming the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  to make it more resilient  relevant and responsive. The record shows that it is only the Philippines that has presented specific drafts resolutions concretely setting forth proposals on the five key issues: categories of membership  question of the veto  size of the enlarged Security Council and working methods  relationship   3 11-51687  between the General Assembly and the Security Council  and the question of regional representation.  Terrorism continues to cast its dark shadow on all of us. The decapitation of terrorist organizations has not put an end to terrorism. We need to address the root causes and conditions that turn individuals with so much passion into beasts that know nothing but violence to achieve their ends. Among many things  we need to further examine how economic disenfranchisement  intolerance and radicalization contribute to the growth of terrorist groups.  The rule of law  including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)  is the key to finding solutions to disputes over conflicting claims in the West Philippine Sea. As we prepare to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of UNCLOS next year  let all States parties remember not just our rights  but also our obligations  for the rule of law is the bedrock on which the growth and development of our community of nations is built. Adherence to the rule of law provides stability and certainty in the conduct of relations among States. In a world defined by unequal distribution of economic  military and political resources and might  the rule of law is the great equalizer  ensuring that rights are protected and responsibilities complied with. Adherence to the rule of law prevents conflicts. In instances of dispute  particularly of a territorial nature  the rule of law ensures a peaceful settlement and resolution.  The rule of law has guided the Philippines in all its actions as a responsible member of the international community. The Philippines realizes that only when the rule of law prevails can all stakeholders and the world benefit from a region of such importance strategically and in terms of resources. We adhere to ASEAN’s 1992 Manila declaration on the West Philippine Sea and the 2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the West Philippine Sea. We call on other parties to do so as well. We also welcome the efforts and support of other stakeholders in working towards a lasting  just and peaceful solution to the conflicting claims in our region.   Allow me to conclude by saying that underpinning the success of all our efforts in the United Nations is adherence to the rule of law and a rules-based international system. Out of the horrors of war  we have resolved as one global community to build and strengthen the ramparts of peace and development. Those ramparts  strong as they may be  can easily disintegrate when even just one nation behaves contrary to the rules and norms we have all agreed to abide by. It is our obligation as individual sovereigns States and as a collective global community that all nations  large or small  behave responsibly through the adherence to the rule of law and a rules-based regime. Only then can we hope to enjoy the benefits of our world and live together in greater peace  progress and prosperity."
"139",5614,"PLW",66,2011,"It is an honour and a privilege to address the General Assembly once again on behalf of the people of Palau.  For thousands of years  Palau was blessed by a natural bounty that sustained our livelihood and bound us together as a people. We lived in remoteness and isolation by respecting the environment and managing our natural resources for the benefit of every generation.  Today  however  we find ourselves to be innocent victims of transboundary harm. Forces beyond Palau’s control  and not of our own making  are ravaging the oceans  damaging the land and reefs  threatening our way of life and  in the worst-case scenario  our very existence. Although we do our best to act responsibly and sustainably  there is only so much my country can do on its own to protect itself. We therefore rely on our partners  the international system and on the international rule of law to provide a remedy.  I would like to speak today about three pernicious types of transboundary harm.   First  I point to the state of global fisheries. Palau’s fish are among the most valuable in the world  but they are in danger. Distant water boats do not respect our borders  laws or traditions. These boats come in great numbers for tuna in the Western and Central Pacific region  where Palau is located. At present  our region’s tuna is being taken for pennies on the dollar. These boats also hunt  fin and sell sharks for a tiny fraction of what tourists will pay to see those sharks alive in our waters.  Like the ocean’s currents  efforts to protect the marine environment must flow across boundary lines. It takes international cooperation to protect our marine resources and environment.  Palau and other Pacific small island developing States have undertaken innovative measures to ensure the continued viability of our stocks. We have limited purse seine fishing  agreed to close the “donut holes” between our jurisdictions and implemented a Vessel Day Scheme.   27 11-50871   Two years ago  from this very rostrum  I announced the creation of the world’s first shark sanctuary. Since that time  countries and territories across the globe have joined Palau in this effort. Today  more than 2.7 million square kilometres of ocean are safe for sharks. Our ocean’s health depends on sharks  so I am delighted that earlier today several representatives of States in different parts of the world joined me to declare our shared commitment to conserving the ocean’s vast biodiversity and nurturing and protecting shark sanctuaries. But that is just the first step.  Global fisheries should be sustainable. Reckless practices that harm our fisheries and threaten our food security should stop. That means that shark finning should stop. Bottom trawling  which destroys the base of the marine food web  should also stop.  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that 85 per cent of global fish stocks are now fully or overexploited. These are the worst numbers on record. The international community must find a way to make regional fisheries management organizations more accountable  so that the world can see whether countries are living up to their commitments. And global fisheries should be fair. If distant water vessels want to come to fish for our resources  they must respect our laws and those of our region. They should fish within our prescribed limits and share the mutual benefits with us in a fair and equitable manner.  Fishing is not a right. It is a privilege. For too long  the exploitation of tuna has overridden efforts to conserve it. This imbalance is not sustainable and must be reversed. This should be done by creating a tuna conservation zone to make the conservation of this valuable resource paramount and to maximize the benefits to the nations in our region where tuna is harvested. We who live in the Pacific see the ocean as our farm  the source of our sustenance and livelihood. At the biggest-ever Pacific Tuna Conference  to be held in Palau in early December  that concept of a tuna conservation zone will be considered and applied to our region of the world. We should continue our efforts to maximize the benefits to our islands of sustainable tuna fishing in our waters.  Secondly  we fear that this year undetectable amounts of nuclear radiation may have entered our territory. This is a particularly insidious form of transboundary harm. I was involved in writing Palau’s Constitution  which bans the presence of any nuclear material in our territory. We are proud to have been the first in the world to institute such a prohibition. But the supreme law of our land cannot protect us from potential radiation coming from outside our borders. We fear the possibility that someday our fish may not be safe to eat and our water may not be safe to drink. And so we ask the world to redouble its efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear radiation.  Thirdly  as I speak  people are suffering from the effects of climate change. As our corals die  shores erode and waters rise  people feel helpless and hopeless. Traditionally  we would appeal for divine intervention. But this is not a problem from above; it is manmade. It poses an existential threat that exemplifies the issue of transboundary harm. Today  I regret to say that we are nowhere close to a solution. Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But have we made progress? While sea levels have risen  emissions continue unabated. We are still without a binding agreement.  This past July  the Pacific small island developing States banded together to put before the Security Council modest  achievable and prudent proposals for addressing the security threats of climate change. But our voices were drowned out by other States’ priorities. I can only agree with the views expressed in the Council by the United States: the failure of some States to acknowledge the clear-cut security implications of climate change is pathetic.  However  we will not be deterred. Leaders of the Pacific States have declared that the urgent social  economic and security threats posed by climate change require action in every international forum. The General Assembly  in its consensus resolution 63/281  invited the relevant bodies of the United Nations to intensify their efforts in considering and addressing climate change  including its possible security implications.   With this in mind  Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands will call on the Assembly to seek  on an urgent basis and pursuant to Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations  an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the responsibilities of States under international law to ensure that activities emitting greenhouse gases that    11-50871 28  are carried out under their jurisdiction or control do not damage other States.  The case should be clear. The International Court of Justice has already confirmed that customary international law obliges States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or under their control respect the environment of other States. Similarly  Article 194  paragraph 2  of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides that States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not spread or cause damage by pollution to other States. It is time we determined what the international rule of law means in the context of climate change. The International Court of Justice is mandated to do just that.  At the opening of last year’s General Assembly  His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that “At the United Nations  we find the proper path in community  global cause … and mutual responsibility for a destiny we share” (A/65/PV.11  p. 1). That sentiment means  first and foremost  that countries must do no harm  particularly to the most fragile among us. We should find guidance in the international rule of law. Nations must respect fellow nations. Whether the issue is destructive fishing practices  nuclear radiation or excessive emissions  nations must work together and cease to cause transboundary harm.  I would like to share with the Assembly a number of important initiatives that Palau is undertaking to connect with the international community  literally and in spirit.   Palau is currently connected to the Internet by satellite. However  the service is poor and the cost unaffordable for most of our people. Last year’s report of the International Telecommunication Union’s Broadband Commission confirms that broadband access is a prerequisite to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. According to the report  a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration in developing countries increases GDP by 1.4 per cent. Imagine what a 100 per cent increase could do.  In light of that report  I have signed Executive Order No. 297 establishing a presidential task force to acquire a submarine fibre optic cable so that Palau will be better equipped to meet its Millennium Development Goals. I hope that others will cooperate to help Palau connect to the world  and that leaders will answer the Commission’s clarion call to ensure that all people have access to broadband networks by 2015.  Palau is also reaching out to the world on human rights. In February  we began our Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review. As a former practicing attorney and human rights advocate  I have been an ardent supporter of this process from the outset  and so I have committed Palau’s limited resources to ensuring a complete and meaningful outcome. As evidence of that commitment  I established a task force chaired by our Minister of State and comprised of officials from across a broad spectrum of our Government. Stakeholders from non-governmental organizations and civil society were also invited to become involved in the operations of the task force and contributed significantly to Palau’s national report.  By all accounts  Palau’s response was a great success. The Human Rights Council unanimously adopted our report. The most repeated recommendation from Human Rights Council members was that Palau should establish a National Human Rights Institution. I have taken this recommendation to heart and am pleased to announce that Palau will establish a National Human Rights Institution. I am also pleased to announce that  as of this week  Palau is now a signatory to all core international human rights conventions. I hope others will assist Palau as we build our institution and work to fulfil our obligations under those conventions.  Once again  I wish to bring to the world’s attention the fact that the fierce battles fought by foreign armies over Palau’s islands during the Second World War left explosives scattered across our land and in our waters. Some of those explosives  which number in the thousands  are still live. I appeal to the conscience of the world and  especially  of those responsible  to help us remove this danger from our midst.  I would like to thank the Secretary-General for attending the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum  held earlier this month in Auckland  New Zealand. That meeting was the Forum’s fortieth anniversary and was the first time that a United Nations Secretary-General has attended our regional meeting and the first time that a United Nations Secretary-General has visited a Pacific small island developing State. I would like to thank His Excellency   29 11-50871  Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his visit. It is a testament to the fact that the countries of our region  even the smallest and most vulnerable among us  have something important to say and to contribute to our world.  I would also like to express Palau’s gratitude for the strong support and friendship of all of our partners  new and old. In particular  I would like to thank the United States of America  Japan and the Taiwan province of China.  In order to further promote the efficacy  goals and ideals of the United Nations  we recommend that Taiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the United Nations system. I believe that the United Nations cannot fully and properly address the issues of health  aviation safety and climate change unless Taiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the World Health Organization  the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Once again  I appeal to the world to allow Taiwan to participate in these important United Nations entities.  Finally  Palau is a relatively new State  having joined the world community in 1994. Thus  we remember well the jubilation of our new-found freedom and independence. I take this opportunity to congratulate the people of South Sudan on attaining their independence and taking their rightful place here  in United Nations."
"140",5655,"PNG",66,2011,"Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea  to offer our warmest congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We pledge support for your statement highlighting the success of global endeavours that are founded on the principles of partnership  justice and responsibility. I also thank your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Diess  for his invaluable contributions to the United Nations  and I wish him well.   I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his reappointment for a second term  and to thank him for attending our recent annual Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting in Auckland  New Zealand. His attendance at our regional meeting was the first by a United Nations Secretary-General and is testament to the strengthening ties between the United Nations and the Pacific region. We particularly note his heartfelt comments when describing his experiences on witnessing the adverse effects of climate change on low-lying atolls in the Republic of Kiribati and the various other development challenges faced by many small island States in our region.  Allow me  like other speakers  to take this opportunity to welcome our newest member of the United Nations family — the Republic of South Sudan.  Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a strong United Nations presence through its delivery of various development programmes. Papua New Guinea welcomed and formalized the “One United Nations Initiative: delivering as one” concept in 2006. That has    11-51372 4  unified all the efforts of the various United Nations agencies under one budgetary framework  monitoring and evaluation process.  The concept will enable a more effective and efficient way for the United Nations to deliver on its mandate  particularly the new country programme for Papua New Guinea  to be rolled out at the beginning of January 2012. It will target the areas of governance  social justice  health  education  gender  the environment  climate change and disaster management.   That new country programme is part of our overall efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since the inaugural MDG report was published in 2004  Papua New Guinea has produced two MDG progress reports. The first  in 2009  was a summary report and the second  in 2010  a comprehensive report. They showed that we have been able to achieve some of the national MDG targets  especially on poverty reduction and child mortality.  In terms of universal primary education  Papua New Guinea is progressing well  with the enrolment of children in grades one to six increasing significantly — by 53 per cent. That is a marked improvement and will increase the literacy rate in the long term. Our Government recently announced a policy of free education from the elementary level to year 10 and subsidized education from grade 11 to university  commencing 2012.  We are also revamping our national health system to improve immunization programmes  to provide a clean and safer water supply  to centralize the purchase and supply of medical drugs  and to reduce maternal and child mortality and the incidence of malaria  HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The recent important summit on non-communicable diseases  attended by our Minister for Health  reiterated our equal responsibility for our own  our families’ and our communities’ health and well-being.  Our Government remains committed to achieving the MDGs  and we are now scaling up progress in all relevant sectors. Our new Development Strategic Plan 2010-2030 and Medium Term Development Plan aim to develop and foster key enabling environments  which will raise Papua New Guinea to a middle-income country and improve its Human Development Index ranking.  We call on all our development partners to complement our efforts to achieve the MDG targets in line with our national development plans and policies. I believe other developing countries will support our call.  We are also investing heavily in the rehabilitation of our major transport infrastructure  including roads  airports and seaports. Aside from that  we are also rolling out rural communication systems and rural electrification. As we are all aware  improved infrastructure will enable effective service delivery.  Women play critical roles in all facets of our development. Our Government is conscious of the need to have more women participate actively in the affairs of state and in the economic life of our country. I am pleased to report that we have recently passed the first vote on a parliamentary bill that will provide for 22 seats reserved for women to contest in the coming elections in 2012. That provision does not stop them from contesting any of the existing seats.  We also appreciate the push by multilateral partners like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank for gender equality. In the same breath  however  we urge them to support our financial institutions by specifically allocating funds without risk to be lent to women entrepreneurs to develop business opportunities.  We note the recently adopted San Francisco Declaration by the countries member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last week  under the leadership of the United States of America. That is a major step forward in supporting women in business and is a powerful tool for women of the APEC member countries. We will encourage our women in Papua New Guinea to take advantage of the opportunities created by that Declaration.  There remain many other global challenges that continue to affect the development aspirations of many of our countries. One is nuclear non-proliferation. The Pacific remains a nuclear-weapons-free zone. We call upon other Member States who are not yet signatories to sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty.  The illegal use  abuse and the dangerous proliferation of small arms and light weapons continue to hamper the development aspirations of many developing countries. We therefore call upon the international community to deal seriously with   5 11-51372  outstanding issues such as the illegal supply of and trade in small arms. Our Government will do all it can to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations in our own Gun Summit Report.  On transnational crime  Papua New Guinea remains committed to working closely with other Governments and relevant international law enforcement agencies to curb drug trafficking  human trafficking and money-laundering.  As one of the top five remaining rainforest nations  we are committed to addressing the many challenges of climate change  biodiversity and sustainable development of our forests. We continue to maintain dialogue with all stakeholders  being mindful that issues confronting many nations on climate change are very complex.  In the matter of United Nations reform  we support and encourage the reform of the United Nations  its agencies and its Secretariat  to make them more responsive to and active in responding to global  regional and national challenges. We reiterate our call for an expansion of membership in the permanent and non-permanent categories of the Security Council  which must take into account the geopolitical realities of today’s world.  In terms of our contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security  I am pleased to announce the deployment of our uniformed personnel as military observers. That is history in the making for our country  and we thank the United Nations for giving us the opportunity for our security personnel to participate in international peacekeeping duties.  On regional issues  tuna is an important source of food and is  along with tourism  an economic resource for the Pacific island States. Papua New Guinea and countries that are parties to the Nauru Agreement are determined to process tuna onshore to add value and create employment for our people. We encourage investors to invest in onshore activities.  At the Pacific regional level  we are conscious of our obligation to conserve fisheries through sustainable fishing. The parties to the Nauru Agreement have introduced the Vessel Day Scheme to limit the total catch for conservation purposes. In addition  Papua New Guinea continues to make funds available to the South Pacific community to tag tuna species so that we are can quantify and assess the tuna stocks for the future.  Over the past nine years  Papua New Guinea has continued to experience unprecedented economic growth levels of 6 to 8 per cent per annum. That has been largely attributable to significant increases in foreign investments in our mineral and hydrocarbon sectors and to the high prices of our agricultural commodities. Those economic growth levels have positioned Papua New Guinea to become a significant development partner within our region.  Papua New Guinea greatly values the objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter. We reaffirm our support for the maintenance of international peace and security  the development of friendly relations among nations and working together towards the achievement of the aspirations of all of our peoples."
"141",5701,"POL",66,2011,"At the outset  I would like to cordially congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of our full support for his endeavours in that capacity.  I am honoured to speak on behalf of my country at this session of the General Assembly and to be able to address in this historic place representatives of all the countries of the world. Our participation at this session is also an opportunity for dialogue  a chance to get acquainted with the problems of nations from different regions of the world and to learn about their achievements and aspirations — and also their concerns and fears. It is an opportunity for reflection on how to deal with the challenges faced by humankind — by all of us.  I speak here on behalf of a country that over the past two decades has become a symbol of positive change — change that required courage and hard work. At the time of the collapse of the communist system  Poland was a country with a devastated State economy and an impoverished society. It was a country uncertain of its borders and its place in Europe. Thanks to deep economic and political transformations  Poland has become a country that enjoys stable democracy and a dynamic economy. It has become a country that makes an important contribution to international relations in Europe and to security and stability in its immediate environment and beyond.   Since 2008  in the course of the financial crisis  the Polish economy has maintained a positive growth rate. It is the only country in the European Union to do so. That was possible thanks to the work and the entrepreneurial spirit of the Polish people and thanks to successive Governments’ courage in making difficult decisions.  In its foreign policy  Poland is building good-neighbourly relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  strengthening the security and unity of Europe. A hallmark of Polish foreign policy remains its solidarity with nations that aspire to live in freedom based on democracy and respect for human rights. That    11-50871 2  is an obligation derived from our national experience  the experience of the non-violent struggle of the Solidarity trade union  which paved the way for democratic and economic transitions in the countries of the former communist bloc.   We now stand ready to share our experience. That is our active and consistent approach in relation to the societies of Eastern Europe and  recently  in relation to the societies of Arab States  some of which have taken up a challenge similar to ours 20 years ago. We wish them luck  perseverance and courage  not only to fight for change but also to conduct dialogue and communicate with all those who can take part in this process. From our Polish experience we know that sometimes the inability to communicate and reach compromises and to overcome internal divisions — the inability to open oneself to dialogue with those who just recently were seen as enemies — hinders progress and can cause the failure of movements initiating major  necessary changes.  Today I speak on behalf of the country that holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). The Union has become in recent decades a laboratory of huge positive developments in international life. The beginning of the integration process  with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community 60 years ago  was a Copernican revolution in international relations. A mechanism to effectively eliminate war between countries that seemed to be permanently in conflict with each other was successfully introduced. Archenemies have become irreplaceable friends. The number of countries that have opted for cooperation rather than conflict has been steadily growing.   That has given Europe an unprecedented long period of peace and enabled economic and social development not only in the sphere of the market but also in the field of human rights and in equalizing the levels of development. The European Union provides its members with security  stimulates their development and provides assistance to less developed regions and social groups. That is possible thanks to a principle of solidarity that goes beyond State borders.  The European Union has introduced a new quality to international life globally. It stabilizes its neighbourhood and is an inspiration and a role model in various regions of the world  where integration initiatives derive from the European experience. The European Union is also an active participant in the process of shaping a better world order for everyone. The progress that the world has experienced after the Cold War in the fields of human rights  international security and arms reductions  environmental protection  sustainable development and many other areas is for the most part due to the initiatives and involvement of the European Union — as Mr. Herman Van Rompuy  the President of the European Council  said here earlier (see ).  I am convinced that not only will Europe’s current difficulties — at the moment related to the financial standing of some of its member States — be overcome but that the EU will actually emerge stronger from the crisis. I am also convinced that the European social model and the model of EU relations with the outside world will remain an important point of reference for other regions of the world. Poland  which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union  will spare no effort in ensuring that Europe remains committed to global affairs and can be counted on  as always. Europe’s solidarity with the world and its openness will remain our priority.  The challenges facing the international community are considerable. The past decade in international life has been turbulent and difficult. Its beginning was marked by the tragic terrorist attacks here in New York  on 11 September 2001. The spectre of global terrorism has hung over the world  in the fear that terrorist organizations one day may make use of a weapon of mass destruction. Fortunately  our worst fears have not materialized and it has been possible to significantly reduce the terrorist threat.  At the same time  the atmosphere of the war on terror has been a hindrance to fostering trust  strengthening international stability and solving other important problems. In the past decade we have had to deal with increasing tensions between rich and poor  and between more and less developed countries and regions of the world. There have been signs of cross-cultural mistrust. Climate change negotiations  the new World Trade Organization (WTO) trade round and non-proliferation discussions are stalled. The Middle East peace process is not advancing. In addition to those negative trends  the international community was hit by the financial crisis in September 2008.  We cannot ignore these disturbing phenomena and signals. Nonetheless  there is good reason to be   3 11-50871  optimistic and to believe that we can overcome difficulties and effectively face challenges. Hopes have been engendered by the economic growth that has been seen in many countries and regions that were once referred to as underdeveloped countries or the third world. Many countries have been able to seize the opportunities made available by globalization and give their societies prospects for development and prosperity. The responsible attitude of many Governments  within the Group of 20 and beyond  prevented the financial turbulence of 2008 from escalating into an economic crisis similar to the Great Depression of 1929. Openness and interdependence prevailed over protectionism and economic nationalism. President Barack Obama’s initiatives to reduce nuclear arms and ensure their non-proliferation should be viewed in a similar manner.  The Arab Spring  notwithstanding the dramatic events surrounding it  is yet another step in the transition of countries in various regions of the world towards democracy and the empowerment of individuals and societies on the basis of respect for their aspirations to live in freedom and prosperity. These are aspirations to a life that is in harmony with values and standards that are not — as they were considered to be until recently — exclusively Western. Everyone  everywhere  is entitled to embrace those values; however  it is necessary to respect the local aspects and dimensions of these aspirations and rights  which cannot be separated from their cultural context.  The path to solving key global problems inevitably leads us to the United Nations or its specialized agencies. Not so long ago we faced the risk of a marginalizing of the United Nations  or even the building of parallel structures. The United Nations  however  remains indispensable in its role  as defined in the Charter and the main United Nations documents  especially those from the years 2000 and 2005. We in Poland combine optimism with realism  so we like the description of the United Nations that says that our Organization was not created to take mankind to heaven  but to save humanity from hell.  The Organization faces many tasks  whose aim is to protect the international community against crises and a decline at the international level. The United Nations must defend the already achieved level of civilized relations among nations  a key factor of which is the move away from violence towards the self-determination of nations  democracy and material prosperity.  I see the main tasks of the Organization as falling within the framework adopted in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)  which focused on the triad of development  security and human rights. I am aware of the complexity and extent of the problems related to development  which encompass the issues of trade  finance  economic growth  environmental protection and development aid. I am aware of the limitations of the United Nations in this area  where the main instruments are in the hands of private entities — corporations  banks  stock exchanges and investment funds. The United Nations and its specialized agencies  the Bretton Woods institutions and others have proved in the past how useful they are in this area.  Today our Organization must ensure the effective provision of aid to the poorest and to those in real need. They are the ones that are hardest hit by the crisis. Our responsibility is to limit the scourge of hunger in the world and help in combating pandemics and in providing access to drinking water. Without ensuring a minimal subsistence level for people  as well as health care and basic education  it is difficult to expect the poorest and those in real need to begin to fend for themselves.  We must agree on a new paradigm for global economic trade. Global equilibrium requires that States with a high surplus of exports over imports begin to switch to growth  stimulated by internal consumption. Incidentally  it was domestic demand that saved Poland from the economic crisis following 2008. If we fail to balance the relationship between these two groups of economies — export- and import-oriented — there will be more turbulence in the global system. Developing countries must increasingly take responsibility for the global economy. This includes responsibility for the least developed countries  which cannot be limited to imports  as this prevents the development of their own manufacturing and export potential. United Nations agencies and entities not related to the Organization  such as the WTO  must assist in the evolution of this paradigm.  The issue of international security  in both its broader and narrower senses  requires a new approach. Here I shall confine myself to the latter. Poland has a strong interest in progress in the reduction of nuclear and conventional arms. We are concerned about the    11-50871 4  prospect of returning to the arms race  as well as by the increase in spending on armaments on a global scale. More attention should be paid to the categories of weapons that today account for the most deaths. They cause conflicts  mainly internal  and they are the main factors of instability in various regions of the world. It is from that perspective that we should reform the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to that end.  Security in a broad sense and respect for human rights and the various forms of a transition towards democracy  that is  ultimately building a lasting peace  depends on the ability to communicate  to negotiate and to compromise. In that respect  the role of the United Nations is irreplaceable. The United Nations has been  is and must remain the main forum and instrument for international mediation. We in Poland and Europe know from our own experience the value of this way of resolving difficult social and political problems. The Polish round table of 1989 paved the way for transformation in our part of Europe. I am convinced of its usefulness in the process of the Arab Spring  particularly with respect to the difficult situation that arose in Syria  a country of great Islamic culture and tradition. We are ready to share this experience with the societies that would like to do so. Mediation is an irreplaceable way to achieve lasting and just peace.   This also applies to solving very difficult problems in the relations between Israel and its neighbours  especially with the Palestinian Authority. I urge the United Nations and the Secretary-General to actively use this means of building trust and peace between peoples  cultures and different social groups who frequently  and for legitimate reasons  find themselves in a situation of conflict or even war.  The spirit of solidarity must permeate the activity of our Organization  which aims for peace  security  development and respect for human rights. Si vis pacem para solidaritatem (A/55/PV.17  p. 32) are words expressed here in 2001 by former Auschwitz prisoner and Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs Wladyslaw Bartoszewski. The spirit of solidarity has been the source of Polish success since 1989  and continues to be a value and source of strength for the entire European Union. Nevertheless  it also continues to be needed on a global scale at this time of openness and interdependence between countries  economies and societies. This requires an awareness of the unity of humankind and a consciousness of the deep commonality of interests among the members of the international community. The failure to respect this will mean failure to effectively take on the challenges the international community faces. In that regard  I have only highlighted a few examples.   Finally  being here  I cannot resist recalling the important words of my great compatriot  Pope John Paul II. Speaking in the Hall in October 1995  he said:   “The answer to the fear which darkens human existence at the end of the century is the common effort to build a civilization of love  founded on the universal values of peace  solidarity  justice and liberty. And the soul of the civilization of love is the culture of freedom: the freedom of individuals and the freedom of nations  lived in self-giving solidarity and responsibility.”"

I am confident that his able leadership will lead this session to a successful result. My congratulations also go to the Republic of South Sudan on its admission to the United Nations.

Our country joined the United Nations as a result of its desire to defend world peace and achieve mankind’s common prosperity  working together with all United Nations Members. Since that time  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has remained faithful to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  as it had pledged.  However  given the present status of international relations  the logic of power and highhanded politics has become all the more obvious  thus negating the principle of sovereign equality  despite the efforts and desires of the United Nations Member States. A few countries are involved in interference in internal affairs and the use of force against sovereign States in an attempt to dominate regions where they feel they have strategic interests under the pretext of protecting civilians and defending peace.   Regrettably  the United Nations has been misused in this process. International law and order have been violated and undermined by the arbitrary and high-handed acts of some major Powers. Given that current reality Member States should reaffirm the principle of defending peace and sovereign equality as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  and speed up the process of reform of the United Nations  including enhancing the power of the General Assembly.  A long time ago  the General Assembly adopted resolutions on dismantling the United Nations Command in Korea and putting an end to the United States blockade against Cuba  which have not been implemented so far. This is just a random example that highlights the urgent need to enhance the authority of the General Assembly. To enhance the authority of the General Assembly it is urgently necessary to put in place a mechanism whereby Security Council resolutions related to peace and security  such as those on sanctions and the use of force  are subject to the approval of the General Assembly before they take effect.  Two other areas where the prevailing logic of power in international relations can clearly be seen are the Third Committee of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. Though it is said that reform is intended to put an end to politicization  selectivity and double standards in dealing with human rights issues  there still remains the prevailing reality whereby specific countries are selected for discussion of their human rights situations  while other major human rights violators are simply passed over in silence  all in accordance with the political objectives and interests of the West and the criteria of Western values. It is our view that the reform process of the human rights bodies should be intensified  so as to enhance the system that seeks to ensure genuine freedoms and rights for the people of all countries  and respect for their diverse histories  cultures  ideas and systems.  Meanwhile  some progress has been made in the field of sustainable development  one of the three goals set by the United Nations for the last two decades following the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. However  we are still faced with tremendous challenges.  We consider that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held in 2012 should take practical steps towards the creation of a peaceful environment for development  the establishment of fair international economic and trade relations  the removal of sanctions  the implementation of official development assistance commitments  the transfer of environmentally friendly technology and increased financial assistance to developing countries.  It is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to live free of the Israeli occupation and to create an independent State of their own. It is also an obligation of the international community to admit Palestine as a full-fledged United Nations Member State. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea recognized Palestine as a State in 1988 and we support its admission to the United Nations. We believe that the aspirations of the Palestine people will be translated into a reality.  Today in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  a general campaign is on in full swing to build a powerful State  under the wise leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is concentrating all its resources on economic development  with a main emphasis on significantly improving the people’s livelihood. We are achieving unprecedented and remarkable success. Our economic development in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will make a meaningful contribution to the efforts of the international community to foster regional development and to attain the Millennium Development Goals.    11-51681 12   In that context  a stable and peaceful environment is a vital prerequisite for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and its people today in their struggle for economic development. To our regret  however  the Korean peninsula does not yet have with a lasting and stable peace mechanism. The national division imposed by outside forces and the fragile armistice that leaves us in a state of neither war nor peace have now been in place for more than half a century. That is the stark reality of the Korean peninsula.  Despite the unanimous aspirations and desires of all the people at home and abroad who want peace and stability  the arms build-up and nuclear war exercises continue to be staged one after another against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in and around the Korean peninsula. Because of that  there is a constant recurrence of a dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula  which is often driven to a brink of war.   The prevailing situation not only poses a grave threat to the sovereignty and security of our Republic but also obstructs the efforts of our people to achieve peaceful development. Had it not been for the Songun ideology implemented by the great leader of our people  General Kim Jong Il  and had it not been for our powerful war deterrent  the Korean peninsula would have been turned into a theatre of war scores of times and our peaceful economic development would have been unimaginable.  The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains consistent in its stand to secure peace and stability and move towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. The present circumstances of the Korean peninsula require all parties concerned to seize the opportunity for dialogue and take courageous decisions to act boldly on solving the fundamental issues.  The continued existence of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the hostile relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States  which give rise to mistrust and confrontation. As long as hostility exists between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States  with the parties to the Military Armistice Agreement levelling guns at each other  mistrust and confrontation will not dissipate and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not be possible.  It was with that in mind that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea proposed again last year to hold talks for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. The signing of a peace agreement as part of implementing resolution 3390 (XXX)  adopted at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly in 1975  would be the most effective confidence-building measure towards alleviating the mistrust between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States  and would further serve as a driving force for ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  Denuclearization of the whole Korean peninsula was the last instruction given by the great leader of the Korean people  President Kim Il Sung. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula specified in the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 is a process of turning the whole Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone based on complete removal in a verifiable manner of the actual nuclear threat to the Korean peninsula from the outside.  The issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula originated  for all intents and purposes  from the hostile policy and nuclear war threats of the United States against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Such being the case  the United States is the main party that is responsible for and capable of removing the root cause of the problem. The nuclear issue would never have been raised at all  if the United States had refrained from deploying nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula and threatening the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with nuclear arms.  Under the present circumstances  in which the Korean peninsula stands at the crossroad of either a relaxation of tension or a continuation of the vicious cycle of aggravation of tension  the United States should boldly abandon its hostile policy against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and move towards full-fledged dialogue  proceeding from its long-term strategic vision. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will make strenuous efforts in the future as well to establish a durable and lasting peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula and will continue to cooperate with all parties concerned for unconditional resumption of the Six-Party Talks.   13 11-51681   Inter-Korean relations have been developing favourably on the Korean peninsula since the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. However  it is extremely unfortunate that North-South relations have now been aggravated to their worst state ever  with a widespread atmosphere of warmongering and confrontation with fellow countrymen  after the current South Korean authorities took office. There is a serious problem behind all that  the issue of fundamental contradictions and antagonism in the approach towards the reunification of the Korean peninsula.  Different ideas and systems exist now in the North and the South of Korea. Given that reality  the choice of method of reunification is itself a vital issue that will lead either to national reunification or to national disaster. The North and the South of Korea  through the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration of 2000  recognized that there is common ground in the federal formula proposed by the North and the confederal one proposed by the South for reunification  and agreed to orient the reunification along this direction in the future.  That agreement between the North and the South enjoyed warm support and was welcomed by our fellow countrymen and the international community  including the United Nations. But the present South Korean authorities reneged on the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration on the agreed reunification method and came up with what they called the theory of unification through absorption  which presupposes the collapse of the other party  and thus put inter-Korean relations into a phase of touch-and-go confrontation and increased the danger of war with each passing day.  In view of the prevailing reality of the Korean peninsula  the so called unification through absorption is a road to war  whereas the federal formula is a road to peace. The federal formula is a realistic proposal for reunification premised on coexistence and the best possible method of reunification able to prevent war. It is also a reasonable proposal for reunification that accords with the interests of the region and the neighbouring countries  as it presupposes the neutrality of the reunified State.  If the present South Korean authorities truly want to see the relaxation of tensions in the Korean peninsula and an improvement in inter-Korean relations  they should abandon their confrontational attitude against peace and reunification and switch over to a policy of respecting and fully implementing the 15 June Joint Declaration and 4 October Declaration  agreed at the summit level between the North and the South.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will  in the future  further strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all United Nations Member States  in accordance with its foreign policy principles of independence  peace and friendship  and will do its level best to defend peace and security in the Korean peninsula and in the rest of the world and to promote joint development and the common prosperity of all humankind."
"143",5772,"PRT",66,2011,"I am taking the floor for the first time  and I would like to reiterate our thanks to the President for his dynamism and stress the importance of the role of his country  Qatar  in international diplomacy. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and warmly congratulate him on his new mandate. He can rest assured of Portugal’s full and continued support.  Recognizing the presence in our midst of the representatives of the Republic of South Sudan  I want to express our best wishes to the authorities of that new State in building a peaceful and prosperous future.  Allow me also to reiterate our warmest congratulations to the delegation of the Libyan National Transitional Council. The Libyan people have displayed exemplary courage and tenacity in defending their freedom and right to democratically chart their own destiny without fear. The new Libya can continue to count on Portugal.  Ten years have passed since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. I want to pay tribute  here in New York  to the people and authorities of the United States  and to praise their courage and determination in facing and overcoming this tragedy. Upholding our spirit of solidarity  we remain fully engaged in fighting the scourge of terrorism and in reaching an agreement on a United Nations global counter-terrorism treaty as soon as possible.   57 11-51360   Camões  the Portuguese poet of the sixteenth-century maritime discoveries  said that “the world is made of change  assuming always new qualities”. Identifying the world of change and its new qualities is an ongoing challenge that we have to face and respond to. We live in a historic time of change and multiple and intertwined challenges  qualities and opportunities.  In our ever-changing world  we now face a massive challenge that requires an urgent collective answer: the relaunching of growth and employment. The economic and financial crisis  which started in the last decade  underscores the reality of interdependence at the global level. Overcoming this crisis in a sustainable and structured way is a challenge that we must meet collectively.  To that end  we must correct macroeconomic inequalities  strengthen monetary security and rebalance world trade. Economic growth is a multiplier for employment at the national and regional levels  and depends for the most part on economic coordination on a global scale. Governments  international organizations  the private sector and social partners ought to cooperate in a wide-ranging effort to restore the confidence of our citizens and companies. Prosperity is more than ever an objective that  if jointly shared  can be reached by us all.  In the context of the preparations of the report of the Secretary-General on global economic governance to be submitted to the General Assembly  Portugal has advocated greater coordination and complementarity between the United Nations  the Group of 20 and relevant regional groupings. We have done so because we believe it indispensable to promote the involvement of emerging economies  the private sector and civil society and to enhance their respective roles in global economic governance.  The European Union is preparing the foundations of its economic Government  which is part of the European integration process. The economic pillar of the economic and monetary union is also making good progress. That is good news not only for Europe  but also for the rest of the world. Portugal is committed to this endeavour and to meeting the obligations undertaken in its economic adjustment programme.   The Portuguese Government and people are making unprecedented efforts to meet their commitments to the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. As has been widely recognized  we are moving quickly and resolutely to consolidate our public debt and to implement structural reforms designed to modernize the economy and promote economic growth and employment. We view the crisis as an opportunity to adapt our economic model and to strengthen the Portuguese economy.  Last year we asked the General Assembly to show its trust in us with regard to our election to the Security Council. This year I want to express our gratitude for the confidence placed in my country  and to reiterate Portugal’s firm commitment and attachment to the values and objectives of the United Nations  as well as to the principles that motivated our candidacy. We consider the institutional complementarity between the General Assembly and the Security Council to be of the utmost importance  and we believe that the Council should be more effective and more representative. In the context of United Nations reform  we need change; we need to see Brazil and India given permanent seats on the Council  and Africa should also be included in this enlargement.  In this ever-changing world  the indispensable role of the United Nations is reflected in the tireless and courageous work of thousands of its staff members and collaborators. Men and women in military and police uniforms play a fundamental role in peace operations to protect civilians  prevent the escalation of conflict and create the necessary space and time for political negotiations to bear fruit.  The Portuguese are deeply proud of participating in this common effort. Our presence in the field represents one of our main contributions to the functioning of an effective multilateralism. Portuguese Blue Helmets are deployed in Timor-Leste and Lebanon  and make up one of the largest European contingents in United Nations peacekeeping operations. They are highly professional military and police officers who make their country and the United Nations proud.  The year 2011 started not with winter but with spring. The world  as the poet would say  has found a new quality  an opportunity for change created by the courage of the Arab peoples who have come together to make their voices heard loud and clear  defending  sometimes at the cost of their own lives  the universal values and aspirations that embody our community of nations. Democracy and human rights are not relative    11-51360 58  values dependent on geography  ethnicity  faith or economic development.  Libya is opening a new chapter in its history — a new era of change and reconstruction. The meeting held here earlier this week confirmed the commitment of the international community  led by the United Nations  to supporting the new authorities as they lay the groundwork for a democratic  stable  united and prosperous Libya. This was the welcome spirit that inspired the Security Council’s unanimous adoption of resolution 2009 (2011)  establishing the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. We are determined  both in the Council and in the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  which we chair  to continue contributing to the successful transition in Libya.  We would also like to see success in the Middle East peace process. Sixty years have passed and there is no time left for advances and retreats  the status quo  or unilateral actions that are prejudicial to negotiations. The recipes  principles  concrete formulas and road maps are all well known. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. Peace may be difficult  but it is within the reach of Palestine  which already embodies all the characteristics of a State  to which the European Union has greatly contributed. Peace in this time of change is also within Israel’s reach in the framework of a stable relationship and  above all else  security.  The recognition of a new State naturally falls to the responsibility of each State Member of this Organization. Portugal has backed the concept that the European Union  through its High Representative  in the context of the Quartet and in coordination with other members of the European Union in the Security Council  has a constructive and decisive role to play in this process  which is at a crossroads. Europe can speak with one voice to build bridges and facilitate compromise. It should be clear that  just as the creation of a Palestinian State is a promise that must be honoured  so  too  the security of Israel must be firmly guaranteed by the international community.  The President of the Palestinian Authority decided to present to the Security Council a request for Palestine’s admission to the United Nations as a State. This step must be the result and logical outcome of negotiations. We therefore understand the request to be an expression of interest that will be fulfilled with the signing of a peace agreement ending one of the longest conflicts of our era.  Until then  we are open to supporting an enhanced status for Palestine in the United Nations. This would be an important step towards the creation of a new State  and represent an additional commitment by the Palestinians to the negotiation process  reinforcing the confidence needed for a definitive and global peace agreement to be reached. Portugal has a unique sensibility in its dialogue with the Middle East. We will use that sensibility and our close relationships to assist in finding the only result that is of interest to us all: peace.  The groundbreaking transformation we are witnessing in the Arab world has created new opportunities  first for the peoples of the region  but also for countries such as Portugal that have a deep and historic affinity with the southern shore of the Mediterranean and the Gulf region. We are building a common future that involves a new European neighbourhood policy and a renewed union for the Mediterranean. Our ambition is for a new economic and commercial relationship  with reinforced exchanges in the social field and a new democratic solidarity  shared in a spirit of mutual respect and advantage.  Portugal went through its democratic transition in 1974. We know how important the support and encouragement of external partners were to us. We are ready and available to share that experience now as a sign of our support and solidarity. An important element of that experience was the contribution and full participation  on an equal footing  of Portuguese women to the post-revolutionary political process.  We should remain united in our support for the transition processes and reforms under way in the Middle East and North Africa  and respond in a coordinated manner to the needs identified by our partners. I naturally think of Egypt and Tunisia  which are preparing to undertake free and democratic elections. I am confident that these two countries will know how to meet expectations.  We note with profound regret  however  that many innocent people in the region are paying too high a price for their legitimate aspirations. The disintegration of the situation in Syria is unacceptable and unsustainable. We welcome the action taken by the Human Rights Council  but we believe that the   59 11-51360  Security Council should also take a position in this regard. And we urge the Syrian Government to end the violence and the repression of the legitimate democratic aspirations of its people.  The democratic transition under way in the Middle East only makes the impasse on the Iranian nuclear issue more evident. It is imperative that Tehran understand that it is time to change and to cooperate and that this is in its best interests.  In the face of current global challenges  we need a strong and efficient United Nations that is able to cooperate closely with other regional and international organizations  whose scope of action has deepened and broadened over recent years. Such cooperation can be deepened with the European Union  which only recently gained a new legitimacy in the United Nations with the adoption of resolution 65/276  which we welcome. But such cooperation should also be developed with other organizations  such as the African Union  the League of Arab States and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. That community of eight nations on four continents  united by a language spoken by more than 240 million people and counting  has a strong vocation to strengthen multilateralism in the service of peace  security and democracy.  I would also like to commend the efforts of the Alliance of Civilizations  a United Nations initiative that  under the leadership of a former Portuguese Head of State  Jorge Sampaio  has contributed greatly to improving relations among societies and communities of different backgrounds and to promoting a culture of dialogue  tolerance and mutual understanding at the global level.  The United Nations is us all of us. We all have the responsibility and duty to preserve global peace and security and to defend human rights in accordance with the Charter. The promotion and protection of human rights  as I have already mentioned  is one of the priorities of Portugal’s foreign policy  in line with the other values expressed in the United Nations Charter. We take an active position in this field  denouncing situations where civil and political rights are being violated and recognizing the social aspirations of the neediest and most vulnerable   populations of our planet  as reflected in our initiatives on economic  social and cultural rights.  I would also like to emphasize the importance we attach to the promotion and protection of the rights of the child  as well as the human rights of women  including their participation in political decision-making. That position is the outgrowth of a broad consensus about and great interest in human rights in our country. It is no coincidence that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and two other important United Nations human rights officials — the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Violence against Children and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation  both of them women — are Portuguese.  It is in that spirit that we decided to present our candidature for the Human Rights Council for the biennium 2015-2017. We participated actively in the creation of that organ  of which we have not yet been a member. We are convinced that our participation in that body would serve as a bulwark in the defence of our shared principles.  Allow me to conclude by reiterating and emphasizing Portugal’s commitment to international law and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts  values that guide our actions in and out of the Security Council  the other organs of the United Nations  international organizations and our bilateral relations."
"144",5818,"PRY",66,2011,"On behalf of the people of Paraguay  Mr. President  I offer you sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I also thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his laudable work as President of the previous session  and congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment as Secretary-General. Throughout his tenure at the head of the Organization for the past five years  he has demonstrated his gift for leadership and his   7 11-50702  unwavering commitment to world peace and international security.  The people of Paraguay and their President  in consonance with our extraordinary national history  believe deeply in the human being as the subject and end of and reason for every effort designed to benefit humankind. The centrality of humans in the history of the universe in all their endeavours  interests and conquests will be constantly proclaimed in this forum.   In order to begin to discuss the future of humankind  we must correct mistakes and rethink paradigms that for decades  sometimes even for centuries  have demonstrated their utter uselessness in bringing about change for good. Restoring men and women to centre stage in the concerns of the universe is a fundamental step in order merely to begin to trace a basic outline for a future of certainty that seeks to replace the frustrations of managing the development paradigm with the realities of a world in which well-being is much more tangible.  What good does it do to discuss development plans if the goal of dignifying the human being is not the beginning and the end of the process? At this stage in history  when we are thrilled by the most incredible technological achievements capable of keeping pace with our flights of imagination and our dreams  where does that leave the nightmare of starving children who fight for a crust of bread  smile if they get it — and still want to play? What benefit do we derive from the media hype about these great global and commercial achievements while in complicit silence the other half of humanity is holding out its hand  begging for a little help  for the love of God? What good does it do us to continue supporting a way of creating happiness in the world that has been loudly shown to be a failure over and over again?  Regions that enrich the economy of part of the world with the natural abundance of their waters  their oil  the precious stones hidden in the belly of their soil  continue inexorably to accumulate debt while their daily offerings increase the wealth of rich societies every day. The poor neighbour in today’s world possesses riches — those closer to the simplicity of well-being and happiness  such as water  food  forests and renewable energy — that are vital to its rich neighbours. But unbridled wealth cannot be the basis for political dominion and certainly not for wars and military might. We live in societies because our peoples and other human beings have mutual needs.  Population growth is a serious global issue. Sometimes it seems as though we live in a world that  worse than resigning itself to poverty  resigns itself to inequality  to the pornographic spectacle of scandalous imbalances which reveal the inner workings of an ostentatious world celebrating its shame  as described by Gabriel García Márquez in his tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother. As long as that continues  the dialogue between the rich bank that sustains and coordinates the world economy and the poor world that provides the natural resources will gradually become senseless.  My country’s growth rate in 2010 exceeded 15 per cent; but tensions made efforts to redistribute that wealth and reduce inequality more difficult than achieving the growth itself.  I think that this is true all over the world. The United Nations needs to discuss measures to enable or assist Member States to work their way through fiscal policies and international market regulations that contribute to the stark reality of the huge fortunes that exist in the hands of just a few in some countries as compared with the inequalities  droughts  humanitarian crises in others.  Solidarity is a ten-letter word that is fine-sounding but sometimes empty: empty of free will  actions and especially results. Solidarity is no longer simply a moral imperative; it is a prerequisite for achieving progress and combating the dark side of ignoring it: violence and crime.  We live in a world which urgently requires a paradigm shift. And we must admit that the world is at a crossroads; because one discourse that has been going on for five centuries in the name of progress and another for six decades in the name of development have only added uncertainty about any improvement in the future lot of broad regions and thousands of millions of people.  The unrepentant incapability of the developed countries to understand a very simple equation in order to set up local development plans as local plans for development means that known errors will be repeated despite the urgent need for profound  convincing and radical rethinking capable of harnessing the mutual trust that can promote progress towards the only    11-50702 8  tangible parameter  the only valid outcome  the only genuine reality  which is a good life for all men and women.  Achieving the good life for all should be the paradigm of our time. It clearly entails envisioning a post-development future in which thoughtfulness  objectivity and goodwill coexist in harmony and genuine solidarity reigns without delay between those in the powerful and wealthy world and those who live in poverty elsewhere.   This is not just a moral vision. Of fundamental importance to progress is the sharing of wealth. And that brings me to the main theme of this forum  avoiding future conflict and future violence. But the paradigm of the good life requires plans that focus on the dignity of human beings and the future rather than on resource exploitation systems which almost never benefit the people.  In Latin America — the region to which my Government is committed — we live the daily paradox of poverty in the midst of the best basic conditions for generating wealth. Historically  since colonial times  our wealth has followed a one-way path to other regions of the world  without generating any structural improvements in our economies.  We attend the prestigious world summits of the developed countries where the lot of poor countries has been debated for decades  yet we have had no luck. When will the countries of Latin America realize that we export nature  we export oxygen  we export fresh water  we export food  we export renewable energy? It makes no sense that our countries remain poor  when we have so many assets and products that enrich the rest of the world.  Finally  on this subject  a paradigm shift to ensure that human beings are at the centre of world concerns requires commitment on the part of those who govern the most powerful countries. We in turn must commit to supporting them and not abandoning them if that paradigm shift takes place. And the most intelligent form of support is  as we have just mentioned  to develop an awareness of what we are and the enormous potential with which our countries are endowed.  Paraguay reaffirms its steadfast commitment to multilateralism based on a democratic and egalitarian new world order  an order that will ensure the comprehensive and effective development of our countries. Paraguay therefore believes both in a stronger and more democratic United Nations  as a truly global organization  and in strengthening progress in the regional integration of peoples. For example  we have the Union of South American Nations — UNASUR — and the future Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  which provide common space for nations that share a common history  common values and common plans for sovereignty and independence.   Global change is picking up speed. The still significant primacy of the central Powers in economic and military terms  and therefore in political and cultural terms  is facing demands for democratization of the world order and progress in multilateralism. The financial  energy  social and environmental crises are proof of the contradictions and conflicts in the strategic interests of the great Powers as well as the weaknesses of the aid-dependent countries and those in the midst of development. We believe in mediation as a remedy to overcome social injustice and as a path towards peace.   Among our peoples’ demands for strengthened democracy  we see the spirit of the words of Nelson Mandela when  in the past century  he said that there can be no democracy with poverty and no democracy with social inequality. That is why the theme of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  on strengthening the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  conflict prevention and resolution  has taken on greater relevance.  Article 1 of the United Nations Charter states that the purpose of our Organization is   “to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace”. Thus  in the face of violence and today’s wars  whether traditional or silent  short or long-term  there is a demand for mediation as a mechanism for peace  as a tool to overcome global social injustice and thus a necessary foundation for achieving international peace and security.   In that context  we advocate mediation in order to overcome global social injustice and both traditional and silent wars. It must be based on the shared but differentiated responsibilities of all countries  developing and developed  in order to guarantee the   9 11-50702  conditions necessary for a peaceful world that relies on the comprehensive and effective development of our peoples. Lastly  it must avoid ruinous hypotheses at all costs  such as those that led to “preventive attacks”  which culminated in the loss of many lives  the destruction of entire cities and vital elements of universal culture  and sowed the seeds for the dreadful mistrust of any subsequent such initiatives.  The self-determination of peoples should not be shaped by the political or economic interests of those who oversee global equilibrium with weapons. It is  and must be  written in stone.  Paraguay plays an active role in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Beginning this year  after more than a decade of uninterrupted contributions of military observers  Paraguay will be contributing a multirole engineering unit to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  the first to be deployed under our national flag.  The General Assembly should adopt the necessary reforms so as to reaffirm its inherent nature as a universal  democratic and equitable representative body. In this way  its powers will be recognized and will take precedence over those of other bodies in the Organization  such as the Security Council  in order to underscore the processes that help to overcome violence and globalized social injustice and build the multipolar  democratic and egalitarian world that we so greatly desire.  In the same vein  democratizing the Security Council is becoming an increasingly urgent task. We urge the Council to fulfil its primary role of promoting world peace and avoiding war  which is why it must be reformed and become more democratic. We must accord greater legitimacy to the Council by making it more representative of the new multilateral and multipolar world order  and by gradually doing away with veto rights.  We must express our concern  here before the General Assembly  regarding the actions taken in Libya under resolution 1973 (2011) of the Security Council and in the context of the responsibility to protect. We believe that the use of force must always be a last resort.  That is why we are concerned about the crisis affecting the United Nations Security Council  which can be overcome only through its reform and democratization. Thus  we insist and urge that efforts continue to be made to that end so that the Council can once again fulfil its mission of guaranteeing international peace and security.  In terms of foreign policy  Paraguay  as one of the founding Members of the Organization  upholds and reiterates the constitutional principles governing its international relations: national independence  self-determination of peoples  legal equality of States  solidarity and international cooperation  international protection of human rights  freedom of navigation in international rivers  non-intervention  and condemnation of all forms of dictatorship  colonialism and imperialism.   In the 50 years since the embargo was imposed on the people of Cuba  Paraguay has repeatedly expressed its opposition to that economic  commercial and financial blockade  as have the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Paraguay has stood together with those countries and called for the immediate lifting of the embargo. In particular  we deplore the impact of this unjust blockade on the Cuban people  which is a consequence of positive laws that affect free trade and the transparent practice of international trade.  In that respect  Paraguayan legislation does not recognize the extraterritorial application of foreign laws that violate the sovereignty of other States. This practice also violates the principles of international law that we  the Members of the United Nations  defend and strive to uphold.  Paraguay has consistently supported the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at previous sessions which call for the lifting of the economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. In full observance of resolution 65/6  entitled “Necessity of ending the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”  and before this Assembly  Paraguay once again reiterates its support for the resolutions adopted in that regard.  Consistent with the stance it has taken in international forums  in particular the United Nations  and considering the resolutions that condemn the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories  such as Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  446 (1979) and 478 (1980)  Paraguay established diplomatic relations with Palestine on 25 March 2005    11-50702 10  and recognizes a free and independent Palestinian State based on the borders of 4 June 1967.  We are gratified that the agenda of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly includes the recognition of the free  sovereign and independent State of Palestine. We are convinced that this is a confirmation of the historic debt of the international community to recognize the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to have its own State with well-defined borders. This will be a significant contribution to the peace process in the Middle East.  We believe that urgent efforts are needed to design and build a new international financial architecture  one that responds to the new era in which we live and provides measures for avoiding systematic cyclical crises and for developing regional mechanisms for economic and financial cooperation. Under this new framework  nations with common histories and destinies can create their own spaces for cooperation and economic partnerships.  The countries of South America have focused the actions of UNASUR on this goal. We are confident that  by coordinating and linking our economic initiatives  we will lay the foundation for integration  which will not only protect our countries from crises that are not of our creation  but also guarantee the comprehensive development of our peoples.  Paraguay is among those nation States which  over the course of history  have fallen prey to various vulnerabilities  given their geographic situation and historical experience. Paraguay has been weakened by a historic model of socio-economic development based on the looting of its natural and strategic resources and administered through relations of structural dependence.  That is why  in January 2010  Paraguay became the Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries. In that capacity  we urge transit countries and their main neighbours  as applicable  as well as international organizations and the most developed countries  to increase their commitment to implement the Almaty Programme of Action  addressing the special needs of landlocked developing countries within a new global framework for transit transport cooperation. This will help such countries to overcome their limitations and will facilitate their overall development.  As a complement to beginning the preparations for the Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries  which will help us to overcome the adversities we face  we are promoting the Multilateral Agreement for the Establishment of an International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries  in the conviction that scientific advances in that area will be of great importance in overcoming the obstacles that such countries face.  Regarding the Millennium Development Goals  Paraguay reaffirms its full commitment to achieving those goals and expresses its concern about the extent to which they will be met by 2015. This is why we encourage Governments  civil society organizations and the private sector to work together to achieve them.   Given its commitment to the goal of fully respecting the human rights of our peoples  Paraguay has decided to present its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the term 2014-2017. We hope to have the support of the international community.  We must express our serious concern for the environmental crisis  which is worsening on a daily basis and even generating uncertainty about the survival of the human race. We fully support strengthening the only legally binding agreement in this area  the Kyoto Protocol  and its further extension. The agreements reached in Cancún are a great support in improving emissions levels but they are voluntary in nature  which contradicts the principle of climate justice that our peoples so favour.   Finally  I would like to thank all those who helped the Paraguayan initiative for the International Day of Friendship to come to fruition. The friendship of individuals  peoples and nations is not exclusively a question of diplomacy  much less a commercial enterprise to make money from the inclination of human beings to join together. Friendship is that bond which must necessarily be based on solidarity  and  in Paraguay  we believe that it is high time for the world to make it happen.   I am pleased that this initiative has become universal. On behalf of the Paraguayan people  we greet all the peoples of the world in the hope that we will find the way to overcome global social injustices and thus guarantee a world culture of peace and friendship based on the well-being and genuine development of all our peoples  without distinction."
"145",5837,"PSE",66,2011,"At the outset  I extend my congratulations to you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly for this session. I wish you every success.  Today  on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian people  I extend my sincere congratulations to the Government and the people of South Sudan on their deserved admission as a full Member of the United Nations. We wish them progress and prosperity.  I also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his election for a new term at the helm of the United Nations. This renewal of trust reflects the world’s appreciation for his efforts  which have strengthened the role of the Organization.  The question of Palestine is intricately linked with the United Nations through the resolutions adopted by its various organs and agencies and through the essential and lauded role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA embodies the international responsibility with regard to the plight of Palestine’s refugees  who are the victims of Al-Nakba  the catastrophe that occurred in 1948.   We aspire to and seek a greater and more effective role for the United Nations in working to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region  one that ensures the inalienable  legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people as defined by the resolutions of international legitimacy and as embodied by the United Nations.  A year ago  on this same occasion and in this same Hall  many leaders and heads of delegations addressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. Everyone had high hopes for a new round of final status negotiations  which had begun in early September in Washington under the direct auspices of President Obama and with participation of the Quartet  Egypt and Jordan  to reach a peace agreement within one year. We entered those negotiations with open hearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions. We were ready with our documents  files  papers and proposals. But the negotiations broke down just weeks after they were launched.  After that  we did not give up and did not cease our efforts to craft initiatives and make contacts. Over the past year  we did not leave a door to be knocked on or a channel to be tested or a path to be taken. We did not ignore any formal or informal party of influence and stature that could be addressed. We considered positively the various ideas and proposals and initiatives presented by many countries and parties. But all of those sincere efforts and endeavours by international parties were repeatedly smashed against the rocks of the positions of the Israeli Government  which quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of negotiations last September.  The core issue here is that the Israeli Government refuses to commit to terms of reference for the negotiations that are based on international law and United Nations resolutions  and that it frantically continues to intensify the building of settlements on the territory of the future State of Palestine.  Settlement activities embody the core of the policy of colonial military occupation of the land of the Palestinian people and all of the brutality  aggression and racial discrimination against our people that that policy entails. The policy constitutes a breach of international humanitarian law and United Nations    11-51185 26  resolutions. It is the primary cause of the failure of the peace process  the collapse of dozens of opportunities and the burial of the great hopes that arose from the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel to achieve a just peace that would begin a new era for our region.  Reports by United Nations missions and by several Israeli civil institutions and societies convey a horrific picture of the size of the settlement campaign  which the Israeli Government does not hesitate to boast about and which it continues to execute through the systematic confiscation of Palestinian lands. It invites tenders for the construction of thousands of new settlement units in various areas of the West Bank  particularly in the Arab parts of Jerusalem. It accelerates construction of the apartheid separation Wall that is eating up large tracts of our land  dividing it into separate and isolated islands  destroying family life and communities and harming the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Palestinian families.   The occupying Power also continues to refuse to issue permits for our people to build in occupied East Jerusalem. At the same time  it intensifies its decades-long campaign of demolition and confiscation of homes  displacing Palestinian owners and residents under a multipronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing Palestinians away from their ancestral homeland. Moreover  matters have reached the point where orders have been issued to deport elected representatives from their city of Jerusalem.   The occupying Power also continues to undertake excavations that threaten our Holy Places  and its military checkpoints prevent our citizens from gaining access to their mosques and churches. It continues to besiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements and a separation Wall imposed to separate the Holy City from the rest of the cities of Palestine. The occupation is racing against time to redraw the borders on our land according to what it wants and to impose a fait accompli on the ground that changes its realities and features and that is undermining the realistic potential for the establishment of the State of Palestine.  At the same time  the occupying Power continues to impose its strict blockade on the Gaza Strip and to target Palestinian civilians by assassinations  air strikes and artillery shelling. It persists with its war of aggression of three years ago on Gaza  which resulted then in the massive destruction of homes  schools  hospitals and mosques and thousands of martyrs and wounded. The occupying Power also continues its incursions into areas of the Palestinian National Authority through raids  arrests and killings at the checkpoints.   In recent years  the criminal actions of armed settler militias  who enjoy the special protection of the occupation army  have intensified. They have perpetrated frequent attacks against our people  targeting their homes  schools  universities  mosques  fields  crops and trees. Today they killed one Palestinian who was protesting peacefully. Despite our repeated warnings  the Israeli authorities have not acted to curb those attacks  and we hold them fully responsible for the crimes of the settlers.  Those are just a few examples of the policy of the Israeli settlement occupation. That policy is responsible for the repeated failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process. The policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-State solution  upon which there is an international consensus. Here I caution  and I caution aloud  that the settlement policy threatens also to undermine the structure of the Palestinian National Authority and even to end its existence.  In addition  we now face new conditions not previously imposed  conditions that will transform the raging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious conflict  one that will be a threat to the future of a million and a half Palestinians who are citizens of Israel. We reject that eventuality; it is impossible for us to accept being dragged into it.  All of those unilateral Israeli actions in our country are aimed at perpetuating the occupation. Israel has re-established the civil and military authority in the West Bank by a unilateral action  and its military authorities determine whether or not a Palestinian citizen has the right to reside in any part of the Palestinian territory. Israel is the entity that decides to confiscate our land and our water and to obstruct our movement and the movement of goods  and indeed our whole destiny. All of that is unilateral. Yet Israel complains of unilateralism — despite our agreements with it  which forbid unilateral individual actions.   In 1974  our leader the late Yasser Arafat came to this Hall and assured the members of the General Assembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace  urging   27 11-51185  the United Nations to realize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  stating: “Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand.” (A/PV.2282  para. 82)   In 1988  President Arafat again addressed the General Assembly  which convened in Geneva to hear him. There he submitted the Palestinian peace programme adopted by the Palestine National Council at its session held that year in Algeria. When we adopted that programme  we were taking a painful and very difficult step for all of us  especially those of us  including myself  who during the 1948 Al-Nakba were forced to leave their homes and their towns and villages  carrying only some of our belongings — along with our grief and our memories and the keys to our homes — to camps of exile and diaspora. That catastrophic exodus was one of the worst operations of uprooting  destruction and removal of a vibrant and cohesive society that had been contributing in a pioneering and leading way to the cultural  educational and economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East.  Still  because we believe in peace  because of our commitment to international legitimacy and because we had the courage to make difficult decisions for our people  and in the absence of absolute justice  we decided to adopt the path of relative justice  justice that is possible and could correct part of the grave historical injustice committed against our people. Thus  we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22 per cent of the territory of historical Palestine — on all the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967. By taking that historic step  which was welcomed by the States of the world  we made a major concession in order to achieve a historic compromise that would allow peace to be made in the land of peace.  In the years that followed  from the Madrid Conference and the Washington negotiations leading to the Oslo agreement  which we signed 18 years ago in the White House garden and which was linked with the letters of mutual recognition — mutual recognition — between the PLO and Israel  we persevered and dealt positively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the achievement of a lasting peace agreement. Yet  as we said earlier  every initiative  every conference  every new round of negotiations and every movement was shattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement expansion project.  On behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization — the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  which will remain so until the end of the conflict in all its aspects and until the resolution of all final status issues — I affirm the following points.   The goal of the Palestinian people is the realization of their inalienable national rights and of their independent State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on all the land of the West Bank  including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  which Israel occupied in the June 1967 war. This goal must be realized in conformity with the resolutions of international legitimacy and with the achievement of a just and agreed-upon solution to the Palestine refugee issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III)  as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. That Initiative presented the consensus Arab and Islamic vision to resolve the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and to achieve the just and comprehensive peace to which we are committed and are working towards.   We are committed to this. Achieving this much-desired peace also requires the release of political prisoners  prisoners of freedom and Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons without delay.  Secondly  the PLO and the Palestinian people are committed to renouncing violence and reject and condemn terrorism in all its forms  especially State terrorism  including terrorism by settlers. We also adhere to all agreements signed between the PLO and Israel.  Thirdly  we are committed to the option of negotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. I affirm here that the Palestine Liberation Organization is ready to return immediately to the negotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of reference and consistent with international legitimacy and a complete cessation of settlement activities.  Fourthly  our people will continue their popular peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation  its settlement and apartheid policies  and its construction of the racist separation Wall  and they receive support for their resistance that is consistent with international humanitarian law and international conventions. They have the support of peace activists from Israel and around the world  reflecting an impressive  inspiring and courageous example of the strength of this defenceless people  armed only with their dreams     11-51185 28  courage  hope and slogans in the face of bullets  tanks  tear gas and bulldozers.  Fifthly  when we bring our plight and our case to this international forum  it is a confirmation of our reliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a confirmation of the fact that we do not undertake unilateral steps. Our efforts and moves are not aimed at isolating Israel or at delegitimizing it; rather  we want to gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of Palestine. We aim to delegitimize only the settlement activities  the occupation and apartheid and the logic of ruthless force  and we believe that all the countries of the world stand with us in this regard.  I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization that we extend our hand to the Israeli Government and the Israeli people for peacemaking. I say to them: let us urgently build together a future for our children where they can enjoy freedom  security and prosperity. Let us build bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and walls of separation. Let us build cooperative relations based on parity  equity and friendship between two neighbouring States — Palestine and Israel — instead of policies based on occupation  settlement  war and elimination of the other.  Despite the unquestionable right of our people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State  as stipulated in international resolutions  we have accepted over the past few years to engage in what appeared to be a test of our worthiness  entitlement and eligibility. During the past two years  our national Authority has implemented a programme to build our State institutions. Despite the extraordinary situation and the obstacles imposed on us by Israel  a serious and extensive project was launched that has included the implementation of plans to enhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus for the maintenance of order and security; the development of administrative  financial and oversight systems; the upgrading of the performance of institutions; and enhancing self-reliance to reduce the need for foreign aid.   With the support of brotherly Arab countries and donors from friendly countries  for which we are thankful  a number of large infrastructure projects have been implemented  focused on various aspects of services  with special attention to rural and marginalized areas. In the midst of this massive national project  we have been strengthening what we wish to be the features of our future State: the preservation of security for citizens and public order; the promotion of judicial authority and the rule of law; strengthening the role of women via legislation  laws and participation; ensuring the protection of public freedoms and strengthening the role of civil society institutions; and institutionalizing rules and regulations for ensuring accountability and transparency in the work of our ministries and departments; to entrenching the pillars of democracy as the basis of Palestinian political life.  When division struck the unity of our homeland  our people and our institutions  we were determined to adopt dialogue as a path to the restoration of our unity. We succeeded months ago in achieving national reconciliation  and we hope that its implementation will be accelerated in the coming weeks. The core pillar of this reconciliation involved turning to the people through legislative and presidential elections  to be conducted within a year  because the State we want is one characterized by the rule of law  the exercise of democracy  the protection of the freedoms and equality of all citizens without any discrimination  and the transfer of power through the ballot box.  We believe that the reports issued recently by the United Nations  the World Bank  the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of International Assistance to Palestinians (AHLC) and the International Monetary Fund have confirmed and lauded what has been accomplished  and have considered it an exceptional and unprecedented model. The consensus conclusion of the AHLC a few days ago here  in this very city  described what has been accomplished as a remarkable international success story and confirmed the full readiness of the Palestinian people and their institutions for the immediate independence of the State of Palestine. That was a testimonial from the international community.   I do not believe that anyone with even a shred of conscience could reject our application for full membership in the United Nations and our admission as an independent State.  It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the blocked horizon of the peace talks with the same means and methods that have been repeatedly tried and have proved unsuccessful in past years.   29 11-51185   The crisis is far too deep to be neglected; it is far more dangerous and critical to simply be circumvented or to postpone its inevitable explosion. It is neither possible  nor practical nor acceptable to return to conducting business as usual  as if everything were fine. It is futile to go into negotiations without clear parameters  terms of reference  credibility or a specific timetable. Negotiations will be meaningless as long as the occupation army on the ground continues to entrench its occupation instead of rolling it back  and to change the demography of our country in order to create a new basis on which to alter the borders. That is totally unacceptable.  This is the moment of truth. Our people are waiting to hear the world’s answer. Will it allow Israel to continue the last occupation in the world? We are the last people to remain under occupation. Will the world allow Israel to occupy us forever and to remain a State above the law and accountability? Will it allow Israel to continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice and the positions of the overwhelming majority of countries in the world? Is this acceptable?  The heart of the crisis in our region is very simple and clear. There are those who believe that we are an unnecessary people in the Middle East and those who believe that there is in fact a missing State that needs to be established immediately. I come before the General Assembly today from the Holy Land  the land of Palestine  the land of divine messages  ascension of the Prophet Muhammad and the birthplace of Jesus Christ  to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people  in the homeland and in the diaspora  and to say  after 63 years of suffering the ongoing Al-Nakba: enough  enough  enough.   It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their freedom and independence. The time has come to end the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestinian refugees in the homeland and the diaspora  some of whom have been forced to seek refuge more than once in different places of the world  to end their displacement  and to realize their rights.  At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their quest for democracy — in what is now called the Arab Spring — the time has also come for the Palestinian Spring  the time for independence. The time has come for our men  women and children to live normal lives; for them to be able to sleep without waiting for the worst that the next day might bring; for mothers to be assured that their children will return home without fear of being killed  arrested or humiliated; for students to be able to go to their schools and universities without checkpoints obstructing them.   The time has come for sick people to be able to reach hospitals normally  and for our farmers to be able to tend their rich soil without fear that the occupier will seize their land and water  which the separation wall prevents access to  and without fear of the settlers with their guard dogs who attack Palestinians. They build their settlements on our lands and uproot and burn olive trees that have existed in Palestine for hundreds of years. The time has come for the thousands of prisoners of conscience and freedom to be released from prisons and return to their families and their children and become a part of building their homeland  for the freedom of which they have sacrificed so much.  My people want to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humankind. They believe in what our great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: “Standing here  staying here  permanent here  eternal here  and we have one goal  one goal  one goal - to be. And we shall be.”  We profoundly appreciate and value the positions of all the States that have supported our struggle and our rights and recognized the State of Palestine following the Declaration of Independence in 1988  as well as those that have recently recognized the State of Palestine and upgraded the level of Palestine’s representation in their capitals. I also salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who spoke the truth a few days ago when he said that the Palestinian State should have been established years ago.  The General Assembly may rest assured that such support for our people is more valuable to them than anyone can imagine  for it makes them feel that someone is listening to their narrative and that their tragedy  the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation  under which they have suffered terribly  are not being ignored. It reinforces their hope and belief that justice is possible in this world. The loss of hope is the most ferocious enemy of peace  and despair is the strongest ally of extremism.  The time has come for my courageous and proud people  after decades of displacement  colonial occupation and ceaseless suffering  to live like other    11-51185 30  peoples of the Earth  free in a sovereign and independent homeland.  Mr. President  I would like to inform you that  before delivering this statement  I  in my capacity as President of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization  submitted to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon an application for the admission of Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations on the basis of the 4 June 1967 borders  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.  I hold in my hands a copy of the application. I call upon the Secretary-General to expedite transmittal of our request to the Security Council  and I call upon the members of the Council to vote in favour of our full membership. I also appeal to the States that have not yet done so to recognize the State of Palestine.  The support of the countries of the world for our endeavour is a victory for rights  freedom  justice  law and international legitimacy. It will provide tremendous support for the peace option and enhance the negotiations’ chances of success. The Assembly’s assistance and support for the establishment of the State of Palestine and for its admission to the United Nations as a full Member State are the greatest contribution to peacemaking in the land of peace  and throughout the world.  I have come here today carrying a message from a courageous and proud people. Palestine is experiencing its rebirth. That is my message. May all the people of the world stand with the people of Palestine now as they march steadfastly to meet their appointment with history  freedom and independence. And I hope that we will not have long to wait."
"146",5883,"QAT",66,2011,"It gives me great pleasure to address the General Assembly of the United Nations this year  at a time when its President is a son of the State of Qatar  His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election and to wish him every success in his mission. I would also like to express my thanks to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his hard work during his presidency of the previous session. Let me also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for the trust that all Member States expressed in him by reappointing him as Secretary-General of the United Nations for a second term.  I come to the Assembly from a region brimming with great expectations and hopes that is navigating through strong currents  a region whose peoples are calling for reform so that they can achieve their goals  assume their responsibilities and take their place in the partnership of the future of humankind  with all of its challenges and prospects.  We have been aware of our role from the very beginning and we have acted within its parameters. We are for the promotion of dialogue among cultures and civilizations. We are for strengthening and consolidating relations among peoples. We are for the consolidation of rapprochement among Powers on the basis of the principles of right and justice and within the framework of rightful cooperation. That cooperation must be governed by the principles  laws and    11-50692 16  international charters and covenants that have been developed by humankind over the centuries to ensure a better future for the world.  All members of the Assembly are aware that the blossoming of the Arab Spring — with all that it represents in Arab and human history — has presented everyone with heavy responsibilities that they have to assume  as well as positions that they have to take. We were among those who made a choice. On the one hand  we have always had a clear policy with regard to the rules that govern our Arab  regional and international relations. Those rules are based on understanding  reconciliation and harmony among peoples and nations. On the other hand  like others  we have been unable to turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to the calls of the wounded seeking help from near and far against an entrenched oppression and injustice.  For our part  we exhausted each and every means  until the only option left for us was to hear and sympathize  and to watch and help. We knew that this was not a solution  but rather an emergency situation in the context of one of the most critical issues in the Arab world today  by which I mean the issue of change.  We know that our principled choices are stable and strong. We also know that our subsequent response to the prevailing situation stems from urgency  and that it is a situation that needs to be settled on the basis of the rules and laws that govern international relations in the contemporary world. It is a situation that should shift responsibilities from States acting individually to an international community acting in accordance with its rules and laws.  We have already expressed our views here  during previous sessions of the Assembly  that the United Nations system needs to evolve in a manner consistent with the situations that reflect the realities of a new world. That world is not one linked with interests alone  but one where it is imperative to have an agreement that confirms the principles that govern civilized behaviour  while simultaneously preserving the unity of those interests.  The major problems in the Middle East region are the question of Palestine and the continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories in the West Bank  the Golan Heights and the Shaba’a farmlands in southern Lebanon  in addition to the threat of war and the strangulating Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.  For over four decades  all peace efforts that have been deployed have resulted in failures to reach a just settlement that would ensure a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region. This is because of Israel’s intransigent position  which seems to be that its military might enable it to guarantee peace and security  and its insistence to play for time and to use the negotiations to preserve the status quo by continuing Jewish settlement.  Faced with this stalemate in the Palestinian cause  the continued suffering of the Palestinian people under occupation and persistent violations of their human and national rights  we urge all Member States of the United Nations to listen to the voice of right. We urge them to respond to the Palestinians’ legitimate request for a Palestinian State that will become a full-fledged member of the United Nations  on an equal footing with all other Member States. This will pave the way for the realization of peace in our region. "
"147",5929,"ROU",66,2011,"At the outset  allow me to convey my sincere congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish him every success in his endeavours and assure him of the Romanian delegation’s full support.  Clearly  the theme chosen for this year’s general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is both wise and topical. Romania has a strong interest in the topic  given our long tradition of mediation  as well as the number of unresolved conflicts in our region. Some conflicts have persisted for years and even decades and remain unresolved. Other conflicts have erupted suddenly  scotching the hopes for a brighter future and for the development of entire regions.   In the current security environment  mediation and conflict prevention instruments are highly important  yet under-utilized. A strengthened legal foundation for mediation and strengthened mediation activities of the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations are necessary  as well as the increased involvement of Member States in mediation efforts.  We must continue at all times to be guided by the fact that mediation for peace and conflict-prevention at an early stage are much more beneficial than crisis management and peacekeeping. To that end  we urge the reporting and periodic evaluation of any and all conflict situations  anywhere in the world and without    11-51681 14  regard to context  by the Security Council and by all United Nations Member States.  The protracted conflicts in Eastern Europe continue to require our undivided attention. We reiterate the importance of the international community’s continued involvement with them with a view to achieving peaceful solutions within the existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to attach great importance to dialogue between the parties in order to achieve mutually acceptable solutions based on respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States within their internationally recognized borders.  In that context  we welcome the opening of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina  facilitated by the European Union (EU) following the resolution adopted in 2010 by the General Assembly (resolution 64/298)  and reiterate the central role of the United Nations and the framework of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Recent problems have yet to be overcome through cooperation  although the dialogue remains on track.  We support the Geneva talks co-chaired by the United Nations  the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Progress on the humanitarian situation should not be held hostage to political setbacks  and urgent solutions are thus necessary to address that situation.  With regard to Afghanistan  we are witnessing progress in the Afghan authorities’ gradual takeover of responsibility in the fields of security  reconstruction and socio-economic development. We welcome the steps taken by the Afghan Administration for national reconciliation. We trust that a rigid framework with fixed time lines for the transition period is unnecessary. Instead  the transition process should be tailored according to the particular realities and conditions required for the normal functioning of Afghan society.  Romania considers that progress in Afghanistan also depends on the efforts of the authorities in Kabul and the continued commitment of the international community. In that context  we welcome the role and efforts of the United Nations  other international organizations and Member States and reaffirm Romania’s commitment to building democratic institutions in Afghanistan.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the valiant women and men who serve the cause of peace worldwide. Many of them  including Romanians  have lost their lives or were wounded on mission. We extend our deepest gratitude and respect for their sacrifice.   Recently  important statements were issued on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Romania favours a sustainable peace in the Middle East  and our country strongly supports the principle of two States — Israel and Palestine — living together  side by side  in peace and security. The only viable solution that could be effectively applied to that case and form the basis of a global and sustainable peace would be through direct negotiations. Romania is chairing the Fourth Committee during this session  and we are ready to encourage  from that position as well  all diplomatic efforts aiming at achieving progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  This year’s General Assembly session is taking place under the powerful image of the tremendous political transformations in North Africa and the Middle East. Romania warmly welcomes those transformations. What has become known by now as the Arab Spring recalls in our minds and hearts the events that took place more than 20 years ago in our part of the world. Twenty years later  we are proud of our accomplishments on the path of democracy-building. Yet we know  first hand  that the journey is difficult and sometimes daunting  with many challenges lying ahead  not the least among them is the fact that the political forces in those countries must remain focused on their goals of freedom  democracy and justice that inspired them at the very beginning.  Therefore  one of Romania’s priorities is to assist the countries in transition in North Africa and the Middle East in their democratic quest. Romania is already supporting democratization in its proximate regions and beyond. Currently  most of our development assistance funds are dedicated to building democratic institutions  consolidating the rule of law and protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In July in Bucharest we convened an international workshop on electoral and political matters pertaining to democratic transition. The event was organized in partnership with the United Nations Development   15 11-51681  Programme  the Electoral Assistance Division of the United Nations Secretariat in New York and the Permanent Electoral Authority of Romania. The workshop was attended by over 40 participants from Egypt and Tunisia who represented public institutions involved in organizing elections  the media  civil society and academic circles and Romanian and international experts. The seminar focused on sharing experiences with first electoral cycles in post-authoritarian regimes as foundational moments for new democratic societies through credible  transparent and free elections.   Romania believes that the political transformations occurring in Tunisia  Egypt  Libya and elsewhere should be endorsed and supported by the United Nations with all available resources. It is our collective responsibility to see to it that the proper conditions for human dignity and prosperity are set up in all our countries and that progress in the quest for fundamental freedoms and equal rights for all human beings is supported. That is part of Romania’s mandate as a newly elected member in the Human Rights Council  a mandate we intend to implement in a constructive  balanced and comprehensive manner.  Although human rights are fundamental rights  the current situation in the world is far from satisfactory. Human rights and democracy are universal values that require our constant attention and protection against any repressive actions. In that respect  the legitimate and peaceful demands by the people of North Africa and Middle East for respect for their human rights and liberty are emblematic.  We reaffirm our will to act in cooperation with partners to achieve a global and coherent approach towards the risks and threats to international peace and security  particularly those arising from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. The best way to reduce the risks of the use of nuclear arms and materials  in particular by non-State actors  is to irreversibly eliminate nuclear arsenals and apply a strict framework for non-proliferation. We support and call on all States to consider undertaking long-term responsible involvement in this area and to focus on global security interests above all.  We are all familiar with the current multilateral framework that governs non-proliferation  disarmament and arms control. All treaties and conventions have proved their usefulness so far. Yet  more is needed so as to increase the effectively of their implementation and the degree to which their provisions are observed. We stand ready to work with others to achieve this key objective for the global security architecture.  Romania reiterates its commitment to continuing its active engagement in the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Pursuing an open and transparent dialogue on the objectives and themes of the Conference during the current session is one of the main steps that will help guide our actions.  The Conference will be a unique occasion for the international community to place humanity on a path towards sustainable development and the eradication of poverty  and  in that context  to establish a clear vision of the green economy. Economic growth and the need to promote transition towards a green economy must be considered opportunities to make more with less  aiming for a higher standard of living and social equality for all.  Climate change should continue to be a mobilizing factor despite the obvious obstacles. We should not let differences and the high complexity of interests undermine our determination. The negotiations in Durban  based on the decisions of Cancún and the Copenhagen Accord  should pave the way towards a swift adoption of a post-Kyoto global regime.  A clear and present challenge is that  while we are trying to set the world on a path of sustainable and equitable growth  we have to cope with one of the most severe economic and financial crises of modern times. The crisis  which still wreaks havoc on international affairs  has revealed the vulnerabilities of our financial and economic systems  both national and international. It has become evident that the world financial system is not adapted to the realities of global competition. Indeed  the entire system of economic and financial governance needs to be revised  and budgets  including that of the United Nations  need to be kept under strict control.  In times of crisis  options are limited. We can dwell in endless debates on “what should have been done” or “what might have been”. But this is not the time for such debates; rather  it is the time to act. As the President of the European Council said the other day in the Hall  “We act  supporting the forces of hope    11-51681 16  and fighting the causes of worry” (See ). We stand by this option. Reforms are needed that lead to the comprehensive observance of good governance principles  human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as the wise use of available resources. That is the only option. A country without equal and dignified citizens can never be rich."
"148",5975,"RUS",66,2011,"This year the session of the General Assembly is opening at a time when international relations are in a state of turbulence. The Middle East and North Africa have gone through a period of large-scale changes  and the situation is volatile in certain other parts of the world. We have not yet been able to put the global economy back on the track of progressive sustainable development. The increasing number of alarming factors has been accompanied by an exacerbation of social  inter-ethnic and intercultural conflicts as well as outbreaks of extremism.  Just as a ship caught in adverse weather conditions needs a united crew and a compass to find the right course  the international community today needs in particular to deploy joint efforts to respond to common challenges and set clear guidelines to strengthen global governance mechanisms. We are convinced that such guidelines should include  first and foremost  the rule of international law; clear  strict and responsible reliance on the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations; and the will to implement a positive unification agenda.  The United Nations remains a pillar of international relations and equitable multilateral cooperation in the interests of all States. It has a unique legitimacy and the necessary authority to respond adequately to the variety of contemporary risks and threats. It is the United Nations that should continue to provide political  legal and moral leadership in dealing with global challenges  to establish equitable principles and standards of interaction  to monitor their implementation and to render necessary assistance and support for the States that need it.  Ten years ago on September 11  a horrible terrorist attack was committed in this city. We are convinced that it is necessary to strengthen multilateral cooperation in countering international terrorism on both the global and regional levels. However  the additional mechanisms to be created in this area should be incorporated in our common work within the United Nations  with due account taken of its central coordinating role in combating terrorism.  Wide international cooperation is needed to keep the situation in the global economic and financial system under control. One can hardly deny the importance of the role that the Group of Twenty (G-20) plays in the post-crisis recovery of the world economy. Today  it is important to finalize the process of reforming the global financial and economic architecture and to implement everything we have agreed on  rather than to stop halfway. The efficiency of these efforts will only grow if the G-20 strengthens its dialogue with the United Nations and its specialized agencies.   A significant contribution to the reform of the global economy and finance is being made by BRICS — Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa — a global-scale association of five major  rapidly growing economies that reflects the realities of the evolving multipolar world. BRICS does not aim at confrontation with anyone. Its goal is to enhance productive multilateral collaboration to address the urgent problems of the contemporary world.  Sustainable development requires a reliable supply of energy resources for the global economy. Russia has proposed drafting a convention on international energy security that would cover all aspects of global energy cooperation  taking into account the balance of interests of all actors in the international market. We call for the start of the practical preparation of this document.  As in economics  the logic of joint consolidated actions should prevail in matters of security and the elimination of surplus weapons worldwide. Russia and the United States made another important step towards nuclear disarmament when they signed the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms and began its implementation. Its practical realization will allow us to make sure that the Treaty is effective and viable and    11-51670 16  to see how its fundamental principles are implemented. We call on all States with nuclear weapons capability to join the Russian-American efforts. We believe that further progress in nuclear arms reductions is possible only on a multilateral basis.  Moreover  progress in this area is inseparable from coordinated efforts to move forward on all aspects of strengthening international security and strategic stability. This includes development of universally acceptable approaches to missile defence issues  an accounting on the impact of strategic conventional arms  prevention of the weaponization of space and elimination of qualitative and quantitative imbalances in conventional arms.  The deployment of strategic missile defence elements in various parts of the world alters the overall configuration of international security. It is not enough to make statements that the increase in global missile defence capabilities would not undermine the basics of strategic stability. The issue is far too serious. We need solid legal guarantees that missile defence potential will actually be adequate to the declared objectives and will not disrupt global and regional balances. This holds equally true for both Europe and the Asia-Pacific region  where the missile defence factor is beginning to affect the strategic environment.  It is of primary importance for us to prevent the undermining of the non-proliferation regime. We call for universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  strengthening of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Russia has been one of the main initiators of the proposal to convene in 2012 a conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East and is now working intensively  together with its partners  on the preparations for this important forum.  The early resolution of the nuclear problems of Iran and the Korean Peninsula would contribute to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We see no alternative to their political and diplomatic settlement and to taking concrete steps to create the conditions for the resumption of negotiations. We call on all partners to address these tasks with utmost responsibility.  The situation around Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi-1 nuclear power plant has highlighted the need to improve the international legal framework in order to ensure the safety of nuclear power facilities. The Russian Federation has made proposals to enhance the mechanisms of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and to strengthen the relevant IAEA norms. We urge support for these initiatives.  In the age of new telecommunications technologies  international information security has become a challenge that requires coordinated efforts by the international community. Reliable protection of the field of information from malicious and criminal attacks is the goal of the initiative that Russia and its partners are promoting at the United Nations. During this session  we will put forward proposals on developing specific rules of conduct in this area.  In a polycentric world  an effective international architecture can be created only if it rests on regional building blocks. The enhancing of global governance at the regional level and the increasing role of regional organizations are an integral part of modern international relations. Integration associations and organizations in the Commonwealth of Independent States area contribute to these processes. The Eurasian Economic Community  with its $10 billion anti-crisis fund  operates in the financial and economic sphere. A customs union between Russia  Kazakhstan and Belarus has been created  and single economic space is taking shape with a view to establishing a Eurasian union.  The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is a key tool for ensuring stability within the area of its responsibility. The signing of the joint declaration on cooperation between the United Nations Secretariat and the CSTO secretariat in March 2011 was a major step in the collaboration between these two organizations  primarily in the field of peacekeeping. We are ready to start working on its practical modalities. Russia consistently calls for interaction between regional organizations  under the auspices of the United Nations  to strengthen global stability on the basis of the solid legal framework of the Charter.  Priority should be given to equal and indivisible security  predictability  transparency and mutual respect  taking into account one other’s interests. This   17 11-51670  is exactly the aim of Russian President Medvedev’s initiative to sign a treaty on European security. Its practical implementation would allow us to finally put a period to the post-cold war era  to establish a universal and clear framework for a reliable solution to such issues as missile defence and arms control  and to create a common space of security and development without dividing lines.  Achieving equal and indivisible security is an urgent issue for the Asia-Pacific region  with the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia as integral parts. The joint initiative launched by the leaders of China and Russia in September 2010 is aimed at creating a comprehensive architecture for security and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region on a bloc-free legal basis. We could move closer to this goal by promoting a network of multilateral diplomacy  an idea that has been supported by the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  Progress in the settlement of regional conflicts would contribute to a more stable international environment. Today  special attention is given to the developments in the Arab world.   Russia condemns the use of violence against civilians and supports the aspirations of Arab peoples for the revival of their States and their democratic development and social and economic prosperity. At the same time  actions by the outside forces must be based on full respect for international law and be instrumental to the search for a political settlement between the authorities and the opposition. The attempts to go beyond the Security Council mandate are unacceptable  since they undermine its authority and compound the suffering of innocent civilians.  In this context  it seems quite pertinent that States and regional organizations commit themselves to strictly complying with the existing norms of international law  including humanitarian law  in order to protect civilians during armed conflict. This step  which further enhances the existing legal basis of international relations  would contribute to the strengthening of regional and global security in its modern  multidimensional interpretation.  The leading role in elaborating modalities for post-conflict resolution in Libya must be played by the United Nations and in particular the Security Council. That is precisely the goal of Security Council resolution 2009 (2011) of 16 September 2011  which established the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. We believe that it is time to take additional steps  including the lifting of the no-fly zone.  As for Syria  it is inadmissible to boycott proposals for a national dialogue  stir up confrontation and provoke violence  while neglecting the reforms — late in coming  but still achievable — proposed by President Al-Assad. It is important to encourage the authorities and the opposition to start negotiations and agree on the future of their country. We hope that the League of Arab States will make the necessary efforts.  The situation in the Middle East could be significantly improved by progress in the negotiation process  on the basis of the main parameters defined and recorded in Security Council resolutions  the Madrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative  and reiterated in the Quartet ministerial statement of 23 September. The only viable basis for a settlement is the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli States in peace and security. We support the Palestinians’ application to the Security Council and welcome the readiness reiterated by the President of the Palestinian National Authority  Mr. Abbas  to hold talks with Israel on the basis of the existing international legal framework.  We encourage the Cypriot communities to continue negotiations under United Nations auspices to achieve a comprehensive  just and viable settlement on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.  We call upon all parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement process to take advantage of the additional opportunities arising from the efforts made in the context of Russia’s mediation. We will promote confidence-building and ceasefire enforcement measures within the framework of the Troika of the co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group  together with American and French partners.  We hope that the decision taken in Moscow on 22 September on resuming official talks on a Transdniestrian settlement will encourage the parties to seek ways to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements.  We are strongly committed to doing our utmost to prevent a repetition of a scenario involving the use of force in the Caucasus  as happened in August 2008 as a result of a reckless venture by the ruling regime in Tbilisi. Russia is ready to act as a guarantor of    11-51670 18  arrangements on the non-use of force between Abkhazia  Georgia  and South Ossetia  taking into account the earlier relevant statements made by the leaders of these three parties. We would welcome it if the United States and the European Union made similar commitments. As guarantors  we would be ready to take steps to prevent the resumption of violence in the region and  in the case of the wrongful use of force by either side  to work towards an early resolution of the situation on the basis of the existing norms of international law.  Russia is providing significant support for the efforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. At the same time  we call on the International Security Assistance Force to more effectively fight the growing Afghan drug threat. Central Asia and Russia are already facing a “heroin aggression”  while the profits from drug trafficking are being used as the main source of financing the clandestine extremist underground in the region. The fight against this evil should be uncompromising  and it should target the entire drug business chain.  The problems on the African continent should be a focus of continuous attention on the part of the United Nations. Such attention should include development assistance as well as efforts to overcome the current humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa and resolve the numerous ongoing conflicts  while maintaining the leading role of the African Union.  The eradication of piracy remains a priority. It is necessary to accelerate the establishment of an international anti-piracy court mechanism in the region  in accordance with the Security Council resolution adopted on the initiative of Russia.  Experience has shown that pressure and unilateral sanctions cannot be a cure-all in addressing various conflict situations; they only complicate efforts to resolve them. We urge that an end be put to any actions that circumvent the Security Council. We also call for the lifting of the blockade of Cuba. Cooperation rather than isolation should be the method for settling conflicts in the twenty-first century.  The ongoing transformation in contemporary international relations makes it a priority task on the global agenda to expand intercultural  interreligious and inter-civilization dialogue in order to devise approaches to the problems of the modern world that are based on shared values. The degradation of fundamental moral values leads to the degradation of society. The recent tragic events in Norway  riots in Great Britain  protests by young people in other countries  and calls to suppress Christian minorities in the Middle East and North Africa — all of those events are the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical values. There can be no freedom without responsibility and no democracy without self-restraint. There is a clear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by nationalism  ethnic and religious intolerance. We therefore reiterate the importance of the recent High-level Meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action against racism  racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance.  Attempts to falsify or revise history are inadmissible  all the more so given that we are marking the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal verdict. Political correctness and talk of freedom of speech cannot serve as a cover when  in certain European countries  people who brought disgrace upon themselves by cooperating with the Nazis are being talked and written about in an increasingly elevated tone. Russia will never forget the countless military crimes committed by Hitler and his associates in our land and throughout Europe during the years of the Nazi aggression.  The rapid changes taking place in the world make it imperative to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to adapt it to contemporary realities while preserving — naturally — its inter-State character and the immutability of its Charter principles. A fundamental element of the Organization’s renewal is the reform of the Security Council. We support a solution that is based upon the broadest possible agreement.  The world community faces many challenges  and the United Nations  as a major mechanism for global regulation  is today in demand as never before. Together we will find practical ways to effectively overcome the threats of the twenty-first century."
"149",6022,"RWA",66,2011,"As the world continues to deal with crises  including conflicts across the globe  we need to examine the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution  and the part each one of us needs to play.  The effect of decades of conflict has been an unacceptable loss of life and a reversal of global social and economic progress. What has also become clear is that although most conflicts are now domestic in nature  they continue to have a destabilizing effect on neighbouring countries and the rest of the world.  One needs to look carefully at the dividends of striving towards shared global prosperity  which in turn increases capacity to deal with conflict. By tackling development issues  for example  through the framework of the Millennium Development Goals  established by this body and the Secretary-General  we create conditions conducive to the formation of a more stable world.  Figures from the United Nations itself indicate that about $7.1 billion will be spent in the period 2011-2012 for peacekeeping purposes. Resources such as these that are consumed by conflicts could otherwise be channelled through the United Nations or other relevant institutions to improve the lives of millions of people.  Thus  while it is appropriate to talk about how mediation can support efforts to prevent and manage conflicts  we should also ask ourselves why  after decades of trying  we are not making the progress we would like to make in this regard. We know that the likelihood of conflict is high when citizens feel disenfranchised and marginalized  and where Governments do not govern in the interests of their people. If the rule of law is absent and access to opportunity is limited or exclusive  that is a problem which we should address as a global community  consistently and with commitment. It makes good economic and political sense to invest in conflict prevention  thus reducing future outbreaks and avoiding short-term  quick-fix solutions.   Apart from traditional interventions that we employ with varying success  there is one major asset that remains under-utilized  and that is our youth. Younger generations carry less historical and political baggage and are more inclined to get the most out of the global village that we all find ourselves sharing. With social and communication tools  they are key innovators and thought leaders not only of tomorrow but of right now. We have an important responsibility to empower them to believe in themselves and in a better future.  Returning to the topic of mediation and the associated issues of negotiation and reconciliation  these practices are not new ones in Africa  or in my country  Rwanda. They play a useful role  and one that should be strengthened. However  various experiences have shown that if mediation is to succeed  national efforts should be supported in the first place  based on specific cultural and political contexts. In Rwanda  for instance  we have seen national efforts produce long-lasting solutions and tangible results on the ground because they are homegrown.  It is also important to involve in mediation efforts regional and subregional players who have ample knowledge of the often complex regional dynamics of conflicts. These organizations should be supported expeditiously before disputes escalate into intractable conflicts.  Additionally  we need to take a good look at the toll that traditional diplomatic mediation can have on    11-50702 12  the lives of people living in conflict areas. Too often  while resolutions are being debated and refined  people are dying. And sometimes when those resolutions are eventually adopted  enforcement is slow  or they only halt the conflict for a short time but with no sustainable solutions.  Let us also remember the limitations faced by external mediation experts who  even when having good intentions  are often unable to foster any lasting change at the root level of the conflict. National ownership remains very critical. Mediation efforts must be based on an overriding desire to help conflicting parties to resolve their differences. But that should not be confused with supporting one side in the conflict or imposing a solution that is in the interests of the mediators.  Let me conclude by saying that the most viable option for preventing conflict is to empower our own citizens  especially youth  politically  economically and socially  so that they have a stake in the management and stability of the nation. Ultimately  long-lasting solutions are the ones that emanate from within."
"150",6104,"SDN",66,2011,"It is indeed an honour and a source of pride to see our sister State of Qatar represented in the good person of the    11-51390 18  President leading this year’s session of the General Assembly. His election was certainly the right choice given his commendable initiatives and contributions to maintaining peace and security  both regionally and internationally  which bear out his qualifications and capabilities. Indeed  we congratulate him on assuming his post. Through you  Sir  may I also convey my congratulations and gratitude to Mr. Joseph Deiss  President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.   We would also like to congratulate His Excellency the Secretary-General on his reappointment. We commend him and his colleagues on their admirable efforts in the various areas in which the Organization is active. We hope that our deliberations this year will benefit humankind and serve to promote peace  harmony and cooperation among peoples and nations.   I address the Assembly today as the Sudan approaches the international community with new momentum  having recently provided an exemplary model in choosing peace and stability  even though their price entailed sacrificing a dear part of our country’s territory. During the past six years  the international community has followed the Government of the Sudan’s degree of commitment to the choice of peace through the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  which we concluded and signed on 9 January 2005.   Despite the obstacles and challenges facing the implementation of the Agreement from the start  we have continued to implement it with perseverance and patience. That culminated in the holding of the referendum on the self-determination of South Sudan and  eventually  the acceptance of its result. We were the first country to recognize the nascent Republic of South Sudan  extending a hand of cooperation and brotherhood to it.   The international community has also followed the historic visit that our country’s President  Mr. Omer Hassan Al-Bashir  paid to the city of Juba prior to the holding of the referendum  as well as his participation in the celebrations declaring the establishment of the State of South Sudan on 9 July. His address on that occasion outlined the guiding principles that established the basis of our warm and friendly relations  discarding the negative atmosphere and bitterness of the past and looking towards the broader horizons of cooperation and communication that serve the interests of that country’s brotherly people. From this rostrum  we reiterate our commitment to that spirit. We also reiterate our congratulations to the State of South Sudan as it takes its place among the Members of the United Nations.   Allow me to take this opportunity to welcome the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the brotherly people of Libya at the United Nations  following the revolution that Libya experienced and the changes it has brought about.  The separation leading to the establishment of the independent State of South Sudan does not mean a definitive divorce  in particular as we live in an era of globalization and State alliances and groupings that transcend political boundaries and traditional frameworks. Moreover  until recently our two peoples were one  connected by common denominators and various historical  cultural and social ties.  Given those facts  we are resolute in our full commitment to settling all outstanding issues with regard to the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  including the situation in the Abyei region  in order to complete the border demarcation and the necessary joint measures and mechanisms required to monitor the border and address economic issues  including access to oil and oil revenues.   We also affirm that we are committed to reaching security and political arrangements that address all the recent tensions in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states. As I have said before  we accepted the choice of separation not because we were bored with unity  for we had paid dearly for that unity  but because we wanted sustainable peace and stability. It is therefore unacceptable and irrational to accept any proxy war that destabilizes those two states  or any other border area between them. That will require understanding of the joint vision that takes into account the special characteristics of the demographic character of the region and the interaction among the tribes in those areas.  With regard to the situation in Darfur  the most recent peace negotiations in the sisterly State of Qatar concluded with the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur  which was accepted and supported by the various groups in Darfur. That support was evidenced by the broad participation in the all-Darfur stakeholders conference  which was held in May and attended by representatives of internally displaced persons  civil society and leaders from the legislative    19 11-51390  political and executive branches  as well as tribal and political party leaders  elders and local administration. The conference adopted the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur because it responded to all of the aspirations of the people of Darfur in terms of peace  development  stability  justice and political participation. As the Assembly is aware  the Document has received considerable support from the international community.   I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our appreciation to our sister State of Qatar  the African Union and the League of Arab States  which spearheaded this initiative. We also wish to thank the Joint Mediation Support Team and all regional and international partners who contributed to the agreement. From this rostrum  I again emphasize that we will continue to implement our national strategy on Darfur on the basis of its five pillars: security  development  the resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons  internal reconciliation and a comprehensive political settlement. We will give top priority to completing the return of internally displaced persons and refugees and to creating stable conditions for them through development  rehabilitation and reconstruction projects.   We expected the Secretary-General to include a special paragraph in his statement to illustrate my Government’s commitment to peace  which was evident from the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the declaration of the Republic of South Sudan  which my Government was first to recognize as a State. We call on our international Organization not to be hoodwinked by the policies of some countries  which refuse to give credit where it is due. The Sudanese leadership  headed by President Omer Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir  enabled the people of the South to exercise their right to self-determination. It made a commitment to do so because of its desire for peace and stability. Consequently  it is a leadership that deserves respect and appreciation  not to be the target of attempts at incrimination or of the arbitrary levelling of accusations  for example  by the International Criminal Court.   I need not recall the fact that the President is the leader of the Republic of the Sudan and was legitimately elected in fair and transparent elections conducted under the supervision of international and regional bodies. Moreover  the unilateral and unjustified economic sanctions adopted by the United States of America against the Sudan in order to weaken it and erode its development revival are but unjust and coercive measures against the people of the Sudan. This is happening at a time when we aspire to have the support of the international community as we move towards that goal more openly and with greater determination to fulfil our natural role as an active and pioneering member of the international family.   As a State emerging from conflict  we look forward to the contribution of the international community and its financial institutions in terms of debt forgiveness and support for development projects. That would be consistent with the measures being applied to all least developed countries  as well as to those emerging from conflict and moving into peacebuilding  which has now become a reality. The World Bank has put forward these and other requirements  and has stated that my country has indeed demonstrated compliance in that regard.  Similarly  from this rostrum  we call on all investors  without exception  to try to benefit from the Sudan and its promising resources  especially those other than oil  such as mineral resources and metals. We urge them to invest in the Sudan’s agricultural resources  taking into consideration the extent of the country’s arable land and its significant water resources. This is particularly important in the light of the food crises  famines resulting from drought and desertification  and the urgent global need for cereals and grains. The Sudan’s investment law has provided all necessary facilities to all foreign investors.  The international financial and economic crisis has adversely affected most countries of the world. In the countries of Africa  the crisis has notably intensified and exacerbated the difficulties plaguing the economies of developing nations  resulting in increased poverty and food shortages and the decline of social services.   At a time when climate change is leading to natural disasters in many countries  I call on the General Assembly  all donors and the relevant United Nations agencies  funds and programmes to respond urgently to the devastating famine and the attendant tragic humanitarian situation  which is affecting some of our sister republics in the Horn of Africa  in particular Somalia.  We also wish to highlight the importance of giving issues affecting the African continent a high priority on the development agenda of the United    11-51390 20  Nations  with a view to supporting and building the capacities of African economic institutions. This could be accomplished by reactivating the New Partnership for Africa’s Development initiative. Priority  support and financing should be given to projects aimed at combating poverty and endemic diseases on the continent  as well as to the relevant programmes linked to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   Since development and peace go hand in hand  we wish to emphasize the importance of supporting the institutions of the African Union  especially its Peace and Security Council and its other various mechanisms  to build early-warning conflict prevention capacities. I need not mention that Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter clearly emphasizes the importance of regional arrangements in strengthening and maintaining international peace and security.   We also wish to emphasize the importance of activating preventive diplomacy mechanisms and African peacemaking efforts. I refer in particular to the experience of the Panel of the Wise of the African Union  headed by former South African President Thabo Mbeki  which is playing a commendable role in the Sudan. This attests to the effectiveness of the role of regional bodies in settling disputes and achieving peace and security in African countries.  The Sudan had hoped for international consensus on climate and environment issues  in particular because we have been directly affected by them  as has clearly been the case in Darfur. United Nations reports have emphasized the relationship between the negative impact of climate change and the intensification of conflict  especially on the African continent. We had also hoped that the efforts made in Copenhagen would have been successful and led to an agreement on how to address this phenomenon and avoid its negative consequences.   We had hoped  too  that developed nations would assume their historic responsibilities in that regard by adopting specific strategies and action plans to tackle the root causes of climate change in a manner consistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development  adopted at the Earth Summit in 1992. The Sudan attaches the highest priority to the implementation of a series of national programmes designed to alleviate the consequences of climate change and to raise awareness as to its dire effects.  The Sudan looks forward to participating actively and effectively in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held next year  in order to help strengthen international efforts to face the challenges of sustainable development with a collective will that reflects the aspirations of the whole world  developing nations in particular  for development and a decent life for their peoples.  Various entities of the United Nations  including the Security Council  have adopted dozens of resolutions regarding the question of Palestine  none of which have been implemented. This is because of Israel’s blatant defiance of the international community and because of the support and protection it enjoys from some powerful countries. This demonstrates that the Organization is incapable of standing up for the rights of peoples and to support their legitimate claims  as enshrined in the Charter. That has given the green light to the occupying authorities to continue with their settlement policies that seek to entrench the occupation and banish the Palestinian people  the owners of the land.  The Sudan therefore fully supports the Palestinian National Authority’s decision to request full membership of the United Nations  which is their legal right  based on the right to self-determination  one of the principles of international law. Moreover  the Palestinians’ request for recognition as a State is a legitimate right that seeks to confirm that  first  the United Nations is committed to its Charter and  secondly  to international law. This would also help to alleviate tensions in the region. The international community should consider the fact that there may be no one to negotiate with if it allows Israel to impose conditions on the world and to deprive the Palestinians of their legitimate rights.  In conclusion  the reform of the United Nations  and in particular of the Security Council  is an urgent and compelling priority requiring speedy action. Without efforts to reform the Organization and its various entities  we will weaken the role of developing nations and have a negative effect on their national interests. This will also allow bodies such as the Security Council to become a channel through which particular countries impose their own political agendas  especially with regard to international peace and security. Genuine reform of the Security Council and its working methods is therefore the only way to prevent it from being exploited by some countries in a   21 11-51390  manner that could cast doubt on the credibility and neutrality of the Organization  whose founders carefully drafted its Charter so as to make it the widest possible forum for consultation and debate — debate that requires cooperation and interaction among peoples  nations  cultures and civilizations in order to create a world in which values such as freedom  peace  security and justice can prevail."
"151",6149,"SEN",66,2011,"Senegal welcomes the election of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser as President of the General Assembly to lead its work at this sixty-sixth session. Therefore  I address to him and his country my warm congratulations. He will have the support of the Senegalese delegation throughout his mandate.  I also extend to the President’s predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  our appreciation for all his efforts to revitalize and strengthen the General Assembly so that it may play its role under the Charter.  In addition  I also reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-Moon  my warmest congratulations on everything he has done for the Organization.  I should like to touch on the theme of the session  the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes. The Charter has a number of provisions for the prevention of conflicts and for conflict-resolution. This goal  which was set down in the Charter 66 years ago by the founding fathers  remains  despite evident progress  a long way off. This challenge concerns us  just as it engages our collective and individual responsibility to save current and future generations from the scourge of war.    5 11-50847   While the spectre of a major conflict has faded since the end of the Cold War  millions of men and women around the world continue to suffer the disastrous consequences of conflicts old and new.  Peace can be threatened in different ways. It can be threatened when  on the fertile ground of political antagonisms and social  economic and religious conflicts  confrontation gains the upper hand over tolerance  respect and acceptance of our differences.  Peace is also threatened when the legitimate aspirations of peoples to freedom and respect for human rights find in response only indifference and refusal of dialogue  if not systematic repression  as is the case in a number of countries.  Our theme  mediation  is addressed in the Charter  but there are similar notions  such as good offices and negotiations. I would like to contribute something by defining mediation as a mechanism whereby a person  a State or an institution comes between two parties in real or potential conflict and seeks to bring their points of view closer together  with a view to bringing the parties to make concessions and reach a consensus. That can apply to internal conflicts as well as conflicts between States.  I wish to refer to resolution 37/10  of 1982  approving the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  and the 1988 Declaration on the Prevention and Removal of Disputes and Situations which May Threaten International Peace and Security and on the Role of the United Nations in this Field (resolution 43/51). To these may be added the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277)  drafted after the first Security Council summit meeting  held in January 1992  establishing a doctrine of so-called tension-prevention through early warning and preventive diplomacy.  The fact is that by no stretch of the imagination can our Organization alone do everything. We must consider mediation efforts at other levels  such as the regional level. It is a pity that Africa has forgotten an original mechanism often used following independence: meetings between Heads of State at their border to directly address their differences. Unfortunately  this good practice is falling out of fashion  with general international mechanisms being favoured.  In the two categories of mediation — within a country or between countries — we have very rich experiences in West Africa. I shall limit myself to only mentioning them  because some are fairly well known.   For example  with regard to internal conflict  when I was head of an opposition party I personally intervened at the request of Heads of State  who appreciated that I had chosen a democratic internal opposition instead of armed national liberation movements. I often succeeded in bringing together points of view and even in integrating opposition into various Governments  which I did myself later by agreeing to enter the Government of the person who had been my adversary in a number of elections.  I can give the example of Guinea-Bissau  a matter resolved by a trio of Heads of State  of whom I was one  which decided to travel to the country  which was in conflict with the army. Order was successfully re-established. The countries concerned were Nigeria  Ghana and Senegal. More recently there was the Ivorian crisis  which ended happily thanks to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  supported by the United Nations and France.  I could add the normalization of the situation in Niger and Guinea-Conakry through the mediation of ECOWAS  which succeeded despite difficulties in establishing an elected Government. I can also cite the peaceful declaration of independence of the State of South Sudan. I commend the representative of that brother country here at the United Nations.  There are of course other cases. The examples I have given were just to show that at the regional level many conflicts can be settled directly by States  sometimes with the assistance of an outside country  such as France  or with the assistance of the United Nations.  To conclude that list of countries  I want to say that just a few days ago  as there is a threat of trouble on the border between Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire  the President of ECOWAS convened a small group of neighbouring countries  and we were able  with the help of the United Nations  to establish a mechanism to prevent the intervention of mercenaries in Côte d’Ivoire who were seeking to enter Liberia to destabilize the country during election time.    11-50847 6   Sadly  despite those successes  there are other potential conflicts  such as that which is harming relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia  and the potential conflict in Darfur.  I turn to mediation used in conflicts between States. I shall take just one example: Palestine and the State of Israel. I commend all the efforts made over many years to bring the two parties closer together  which unfortunately have not yet succeeded. So this year we have an application by Palestine to the General Assembly for recognition as a Member State of the United Nations. There is no doubt about Senegal’s support for the application; it is the consequence of what has been our policy for a long time  particularly as today Senegal is Chairman of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.  Senegal supports an independent Palestinian State within internationally recognized borders as well as the existence of the State of Israel  each within its own borders. It will not be easy to achieve that  but the international community will do its very best.  I take this opportunity to make a clarification  because  despite my proximity to the Arab countries and to the Palestinians  a few days ago a statement was made about my playing the role of mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict. President Netanyahu’s understanding was mistaken. I have never been a mediator in the Palestine-Israel conflict and have never sought to be a mediator. Moreover  we need to do much more than to call one country or one person to mediate in such a complicated situation.  All goodwill is needed for a solution. Having been awarded the Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize  I must honour that distinction  so wherever I can intervene to find solutions I do so  on my own responsibility. I intervened personally for the release of a young soldier  Gilad Shalit  a few years ago.   Unfortunately  that was not successful  but on the basis of a number of suggestions I took the initiative once again some days ago. That seems to have had a reaction  in the light of what President Netanyahu said. He said that he did not want mediation by Senegal  and that Senegal was an ally of Palestine. But he was wrong. I do not do mediation; I provide good offices; I take it on my own responsibility to help release one young man when I believe that that young man should be elsewhere other than a prison and when I think that I can convince the parties — above all  the Palestinian parties  the current Government of Palestine  Hamas — of the need to release that young man for humanitarian reasons.   If I succeed  excellent; if I fail  it will not stop me from starting over again. I will do that regardless of the position of the two parties — in other words  regardless of the position of Israel and of the position of Hamas. That is consistent with my philosophy of peace and the choice that I have made to contribute to extending cooperation where I can.  I believe that fear and mistrust  which persist between Israel and Palestine  could be mitigated — this is a simple suggestion that I make to our Secretary-General — by establishing a committee of three States chosen by the two parties. Those States would hold discussions to discover what guarantees are demanded by each party to commit to the path of negotiation for the existence of two States  the State of Israel and the State of Palestine  because at present  I believe  there is no dialogue  indirect or direct. I believe that my suggestion could facilitate understanding of the positions on both sides and could help mitigate fears and concerns that are major psychological barriers to discussion and to any agreement.  Maybe I am wrong. Maybe this will not end in anything  but it costs nothing to try. I say to the Secretary-General: “Before you reply ‘No’  I want you to consider my proposal for 40 days. If after that time you think that it cannot help solve the problem  you can say so. But I beg you to try to understand the proposal.” I am ready to go into further details  even in a document. I have established this position  which could ultimately be fine-tuned using other people’s contributions.  As I come to the end of my address I want to touch on Security Council reform. The topic has kept returning in a cyclical fashion for 18 years  and we have made no progress  due to great confusion.  The current Security Council system has certain advantages. A Security Council  an international order  must exist  but it must be improved. But in its current functioning the Security Council has a fundamental role  which is to ignore the African continent. Even on recent issues  such as Libya  Africa has no permanent seat with a right of veto.    7 11-50847   I will not speak of general reform of the Security Council. I know that it will not happen overnight. But I also know that since its creation there has been a need to increase the number of seats  and there needs to be a better distribution.  I call for the remedying of a historic injustice to Africa. Seventy per cent of the issues on the Security Council agenda are African questions  and Africa is absent  even on the question of Libya. Libya is an African country. Therefore  it would be good to have an African country with a permanent seat on the Security Council with a right to the veto. I am not talking about a non-permanent seat; it must be permanent.   We have made progress  because when a few years ago I had discussions with members of the Council the majority thought that the idea was reasonable  if it could be detached from more general demands. But each time we bring it up it is a case of one step forward  two steps back. But we should not be discouraged.  I come to my last point: the environment and the agricultural crisis. These are also issues of peace  because the environment is linked to climate change affecting particularly the developing countries  and above all Africa.  A few years ago a French philosopher wrote a famous work  “L’Afrique  terre qui meurt”  in which he spoke of savannization and desertification  problems that my own country suffers from. In the Sahel I find that those words are particularly well based.   Above all  coastal erosion is accelerating. From Morocco to the Gulf of Guinea seawater is filtering through layers of the continental shelf deep into the continent — 480 kilometres — salinizating the water table  with the result that the population is suffering an increasing lack of drinking water.  Marine erosion does not just mean that the coast is being eroded by the sea. It is destroying land in the interior  and making populations emigrate towards areas where they can find potable water. It is historically one of the main mechanisms of desertification. Sometimes whole populations are forced to go elsewhere.  But we are not standing idly by. That is why we have created the Great Green Wall  extending from Dakar to Djibouti  7 000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide. That is why we called on the EU to finance a study with European and African experts to find a solution to the infiltration of marine waters into the continental shelf.  We have built part of the Atlantic wall in Senegal  but only two kilometres  because one kilometre costs a great deal of money — $2 million. In depth it is to go as far as the granite plateau  at which point it can go no further. We do not want to take it too far  because in environmental matters it is important before doing anything to find out what the consequences elsewhere will be.   That is why we need to analyse the matter in an entirely scientific way  since the forces of the sea that are stopped have not been negated; they are diverted by the sand and liquids. The experts can clarify the situation and help us  with full knowledge of the facts  use our resources to end this degradation  which  sadly  is leading to the disappearance of a large part of our continent. The tsunami is not just the effect of huge waves on a coast. It is also destruction that happens within our continent. I wanted to mention that phenomenon to draw attention to the great dangers threatening Africa.  Finally  we recently held the second International Dakar Agricultural Forum to consider the rise in agriculture prices  from which even producing countries are suffering  like us  because we are also big consumers. The participants proposed the establishment of an organization for global agricultural governance. We urge that the headquarters of such an important institution be in Africa  and not in a developed country. There is no major organization of its kind with its headquarters in Africa. The organizations that are helping us need to be with us on the ground.   The role of the proposed organization would be to regulate the prices of agricultural products and ensure a minimum income for small farmers. I commend our draft resolution on the matter. The policy of the organization could be to play a role in reducing productivity differentials. Why is productivity higher in the United States and Europe than in Africa — for example  in Zimbabwe? We need to ask the question and find solutions.  In Senegal  we have addressed the issue with a plan that we call the Grand Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance to deal with the productivity    11-50847 8  differentials between Senegal and certain Italian regions. It has allowed us to move from being  in 2007  dependent on others for food to the status of a country that has achieved food self-sufficiency. This year we may even be able to begin exporting  which is a remarkable achievement.  I must say that we have been helped by chance  since fertilizer constitutes at least 30 per cent of costs  and our fertilizer can be used directly  without any preparation. Moreover  friendly countries helped us acquire important equipment on very favourable conditions over a long term.  The scope and complexity of the Organization’s tasks put in perspective its successes and its setbacks. But what determines our commitment to the institution  what gives hope to the peoples that we represent here  what definitively gives them trust and faith in the Organization  is the feeling that when it deliberates  when it decides and when it acts  it observes without discrimination the principles enshrined in the Charter: universality  legality  justice and impartiality.  Finally  the extent to which those values are safeguarded is the measure of the legitimacy and success of our Organization’s interventions."
"152",6196,"SGP",66,2011,"Allow me to congratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I would also like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous reappointment to a second term.  I extend my warmest congratulations to South Sudan on becoming the newest Member of the United Nations family. We wish President Al-Nasser and Secretary-General Ban success in the year ahead.  The world has seen difficult times since the global economic crisis of 2008. This has been compounded by natural and man-made disasters  which have grown in scale and severity. The repercussions of those events produce unpredictable outcomes. Governments have to grapple with the challenge of reviving growth and creating jobs for our citizens  even as the uncertain global economic recovery comes under threat from the severe fiscal and debt crisis in the United States and eurozone. Fears about the risk of a double-dip recession remain.  Other important global challenges need serious attention and resources as well. Those include long-term issues such as sustainable development  climate change and water security. There are also immediate concerns such as food security  job creation and making our cities more livable. These are issues that require urgent joint action by the global community.  By next month  we will have 7 billion people to feed  clothe and find meaningful employment for. That is a stark reminder of the magnitude of our task. The United Nations must play an important role in dealing with these challenges. First  the United Nations  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization can help ensure that the global economic framework remains conducive to growth amidst the maelstrom of economic instability.  We are in for a bumpy ride  with growth in all the major markets slowing  and there is no guarantee of quick recovery. At the same time  we face a worrisome rise in protectionist sentiments. A recent report by the World Trade Organization showed that the Group of 20 (G-20) countries introduced 122 new trade-restrictive measures from 2010 to April 2011. Too many countries are focused more on domestic political concerns than on implementing their multilateral commitments and taking concerted action at the global level. That is why the prospects for a breakthrough in the Doha Development Round continue to be slim.   As the pre-eminent multilateral institution in the world  the United Nations should take a strong stand  make a united pledge against trade-restrictive measures and continue to push for free trade. Fighting protectionist pressures collectively is important for the long-term sustainability of our economies. The philosophy of common enrichment that imbues the United Nations Charter must replace short-sighted strategies of survival if we are to truly take the path towards sustainability. Due to its sheer membership size and functions  the United Nations will need time to achieve consensus and make decisions. That leaves the door open for ad hoc coordination by smaller  informal groups  especially during critical periods like the fall of 2008. There is a role for smaller  regional groupings like the G-20 and the Group of Eight  which may be more efficient and dynamic in decision-making.   A certain amount of fluidity is a given in global governance for some time to come  and even necessary in order to tackle increasingly complex and varied global problems. But ultimately  a balance needs to be struck between efficiency and genuine legitimacy. The G-20 accounts for over 80 per cent of world trade and gross domestic product  but that still leaves the majority of countries and a significant number of people outside of that group. There is scope for the United Nations to play a meaningful role by ensuring that all groupings take into account and promote the greater interest. The United Nations must also act together with such groupings as complementary parts   9 11-51670  of the international system  not as mutually exclusive competitors.  The United Nations also has an important role in tackling two other challenges — food and water security  which are two sides of the same coin. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has reported an escalation of international food prices to levels not seen in decades. And according to the World Bank  rising food costs have pushed 44 million people into extreme poverty and hunger since June 2010. The hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa is but one face of this devastation.  Equally critical is the challenge of water security. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has pointed out that about one-third of the world’s population lives in countries with moderate to high water stress  with a disproportionate impact on the poor. With current projected global population growth  the task of providing water for human sustenance will become increasingly difficult  and increasing competition over this scarce but vital resource may fuel instability and conflict within and between States.  The United Nations is doing a great deal in both areas to proactively foster collaboration among Member States. UNEP has long actively addressed the water issue  together with partner United Nations agencies and other organizations. Looking ahead  the United Nations can do more to build synergies of technology  policy and capacity in this field. In this regard  events like the annual World Water Week in Stockholm come to the forefront of the public’s minds when talking about championing water issues.  Likewise  since 2008  Singapore has organized the Singapore International Water Week  a global platform that brings together policymakers  industry leaders  experts and practitioners to address challenges  showcase technologies  discover opportunities and celebrate achievements in the water world. In Singapore  we have always regarded water as a strategic resource. We have invested considerable resources in researching and testing new technologies. We would be happy to share our experiences.  I am certain that there are also many other success stories of countries that have adopted modern technology and sound policies to overcome their water insecurity. That is why Singapore is happy to be a member of the Green Group  an informal grouping initiated by Slovenia  whose members discuss ways to augment our collective experiences in water management. That model can be replicated by the United Nations to include more Member States.  We also need to look at the processes  procedures and leadership within the United Nations. The efficiency of our responses can and should be reviewed and improved upon. At present  there is a disconnect between the proliferation of resolutions  which we debate year after year  and actual present realities. There is a great need to coordinate better between New York and the ground. The immense good work in the field that various United Nations personnel  such as our humanitarian and aid workers  are doing has to be better related to what Member States do at Headquarters.  While established processes are important  that should not hamper innovative thinking and solutions. For example  we should set definitive timelines and specific objectives for resolutions  and retire others. Let us focus on what needs to be done  who should do it  and by when it should be done. This will ensure that there are targeted outcomes and real implementation. This may seem like a small  procedural change  but to borrow a phrase  sometimes little things can make a big difference.   The alternative is to leave the shaping of the new global governance to other groupings  which will by definition be less inclusive. That will lead to a further marginalization of the small and the weak. The United Nations needs to find ways to work with limited groupings as complementary parts of the international system. This is what the Global Governance Group  or 3G  has sought to achieve.  To act as a bridge between the United Nations and the Group of 20  the 3G has provided ideas to strengthen the latter’s engagement with the United Nations. The 3G has focused on areas of ongoing and potential cooperation such as development  tackling the problem of food security and fostering the growth of livable cities. It has also called for a comprehensive approach to addressing the different factors affecting food security and the volatility of food prices. That includes a call for a renewed political commitment to a universal  rules-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization  which we believe is critical to achieving food security.    11-51670 10   The United Nations remains the only truly universal and international organization. There is no alternative to the United Nations. The steady expansion of its membership from 51 at its founding in 1945 to 193 today is a testament to the value that countries accord to membership in this Organization.  The United Nations is uniquely placed to influence our collective future. However  we should not take this position for granted  for the Organization’s ability to influence global issues is ultimately dependent on the decisions that we as Member States take at the United Nations.  Sixty-five years ago  following the devastation of World War II  we managed to forge a consensus that was underpinned by the notion of inclusive global citizenship and manifested by the establishment of a set of international institutions  practices and norms. At the forefront was the United Nations Charter.   Globalization and economic integration have since redefined global governance and decision-making. The United Nations needs to adjust its processes to this new environment. But at the core  its values remain the same: to maintain international peace and security and to promote development  human rights and respect for the rule of law.  It is up to us  the Member States  to rally the necessary political will to put aside narrow self-interests and act for our collective good and secure the well-being of our future generations."
"153",6229,"SLB",66,2011,"Solomon Islands  with much pride  wishes to thank our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for honouring my country with a historic visit earlier this month. He is the first Secretary-General to have set foot on a Pacific small island developing State with least developed country (LDC) status. His re-election   13 11-51372  to a second five-year term speaks to his strong conviction in advancing multilateralism and his attentiveness to the challenges facing all members  including the vulnerable countries. We once again pledge our support to the Secretary-General during his second term in office.  Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership and tireless work of Mr. Joseph Deiss as President of the General Assembly during the past session  and to congratulate the President of the current session on his election. I am confident that  under his leadership  the responsibilities of the United Nations will be strengthened  especially at a time when there is nervousness in world markets  with the threat of a possible double-dip recession becoming more real every day; a time when the world is witnessing unrest in Asia  riots in Europe and famine in the Horn of Africa; a time when the narrow interests and ambitions of some are being cycled through the United Nations system  thereby harming the principles for which this Organization stands.  In this respect  the theme for the sixty-sixth session  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is fitting and timely. The Organization was set up to preserve peace for all  not conditional peace for some. It is about honest international cooperation built on a spirit of optimism and positivism. It is about interaction between States with a sense of duty and an awakened conscience to effect change. Multilateral diplomatic and political initiatives need to take centre stage instead of military solutions  which may lead to lengthy and protracted conflicts.  The role of mediation in Solomon Islands is about creating a common voice among the 87 different languages spoken in the country. The Government remains committed to building a cohesive multicultural society with equal opportunities for all. The Solomon Islands Ministry of National Unity  Reconciliation and Peace  along with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  is in its third year of continuing to build bridges between formerly conflicting parties by conveying a message of tolerance  respect  dialogue and understanding among Solomon Islanders.  I am pleased to say that my Government is reforming and improving our democratic system by setting the goal of continuing national consultations on the Political Parties’ Integrity Bill  introduced in 2009 by the previous Government. We are developing a comprehensive policy to identify legislation that needs to be reviewed or enacted.  Solomon Islands has set itself progressively ambitious goals within the various international frameworks. We can achieve all of those goals only by having focused a relationship with the United Nations. We feel that the United Nations needs to engage in special outreach to countries with special needs  especially those lagging furthest behind  so as to assist them in implementing the outcomes of global agreements. To make a difference  the international community must honour its commitments  and do so by giving sufficiently to ensure that the required economic transformation occurs in LDCs and small island developing States (SIDS).  Multilateralism has provided the basis for our foreign policy. We opened a second Permanent Mission to the United Nations  in Geneva  in June this year  and would like to see our action reciprocated with an enhanced United Nations country presence in Solomon Islands. We have an over-regionalized United Nations system that has seen problems grow in the Pacific. Small as we are  three of our Pacific countries have experienced conflict over the past two decades  and five of the 12 are listed as least developed countries.  Today  non-communicable diseases (NCDs) claim six in every 10 lives in the Pacific. Non-communicable diseases are pandemic in the region. In that regard  Solomon Islands has put in place a non-communicable diseases strategic plan for the period 2011-2015. Prevention remains the cornerstone of our NCD policy  as does the development of our primary health coverage across the country. We will continue to need sustained external support in the short to medium term so that we can implement our NCD programmes.  Solomon Islands  as a least developed country  applauds the adoption in May of the 10-year Istanbul Programme of Action for the least developed countries. The Programme provides an opportunity to lift 880 million people within the international community out of poverty. The 48 LDCs have developed a programme with the ambitious target of seeing half of the LDCs graduate by 2020. The programme focuses on investing in the productive sectors of LDCs in order to tackle our development challenges by triggering stable  sustained and inclusive economic growth. Partnership is critical to support investment in income-   11-51372 14  generating activities  employment creation  infrastructure development  rural agricultural development and investment in smallholder farmers. Solomon Islands  in reaching out to the 85 per cent of its population living in rural areas  is currently implementing parallel sectoral and constitutional reforms and land reform programmes.  Solomon Islands supports the call for the Secretary-General to conduct structured discussions on a post-2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agenda. As we all must realize and admit  we will fall short of achieving the Millennium Development Goals come 2015. The review must examine the means of achieving the social and development goals. That means looking at the MDGs from a sustainable development perspective. Solomon Islands looks forward to that discussion.  On climate change  we call on the Secretary-General to garner the necessary political will from our developed partners to adopt a second commitment period in Durban under the Kyoto Protocol. This would avoid a gap between the first and second commitment periods and would be sufficient to ensure the survival of all vulnerable people and prevent climate change impacts from reaching irreversible levels.  Problems associated with climate change are growing challenges for our country. We are taking several practical measures. The Government is planning the relocation of our national referral hospital to higher ground. Efforts to build a resilience policy on food and water security are progressing under the adaptation programme. Our climate change challenges are growing  and fast-track funds promised two years ago must be made available to vulnerable countries as a matter of real urgency. Solomon Islands is in the process of establishing economic growth centres throughout the country  and we are looking at powering these centres with renewable energy  which we view as a necessity and a condition for growth.  Solomon Islands is grateful for the growth of South-South cooperation and its policy engagement within the international community  especially support from such countries as Cuba  India and Papua New Guinea. We also welcome new non-traditional partners with our region  including Luxembourg  Georgia and Italy  who have rendered support and are instrumental in complementing the support from our traditional partners the European Union  Australia  New Zealand  the Republic of China and Japan.  Solomon Islands  as a post-conflict country  remains engaged with the Australia-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI)  with support from New Zealand and other Pacific Islands Forum member countries. The Secretary-General  during his recent trip to my country  had a bird’s eye view of the achievements of RAMSI in the restoration of law and order and the reform of our economic and governance systems. My country remains grateful to all our Pacific neighbours for their support and reiterates that any winding down of RAMSI activities should be done in a calculated and responsible manner.   We continue to seek homegrown solutions within the region. The Melanesian Spearhead Group has agreed to establish a Melanesian regional police academy  bringing together Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Vanuatu and Solomon Islands discipline forces to respond to emerging needs  from disasters to conflicts. Solomon Islands hopes to join Fiji  Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea in having its police force participate in United Nations missions. Work is still in progress  and we hope to conclude it soon.  Within my region  Solomon Islands continues to support the inscription of the French territory of New Caledonia on the United Nations decolonization list and will extend similar support to French Polynesia  working with all stakeholders  including the Administrator. In particular  the Melanesian Spearhead Group countries strongly support the inscription of New Caledonia and French Polynesia for decolonization.  The current international system has pushed us to the edge of our finite natural resources. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio next year will be another global opportunity to identify gaps within existing sustainable development frameworks  from the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy  which recognize the special situation of small island developing States  to the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs. We strongly urge signatory countries to honour their commitments.  Solomon Islands looks forward to the negotiations scheduled for late this year. Already  we are in the midst of preserving the last global stock of tuna by creating the world’s first sustainable industrial   15 11-51372  fishing industry through a subregional intergovernmental mechanism. Fisheries remain our source of food and income  and we will need to maximize returns from these resources in a sustainable manner by bringing together three pillars of sustainable development on equal footing and in a balanced and sustainable manner.  Solomon Islands is host to the regional Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency  and we continue to register our interest in hosting the regional marine scientific and technological centre of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to advance marine scientific research in the Pacific region and to foster the transfer of marine technology for the development of our ocean and marine resources.  Solomon Islands believes in dialogue and engagement with all countries of the world  including Fiji. We do so within the framework of the United Nations Charter and the Melanesian Spearhead Group principles  with mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other’s internal affairs  equality  mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence with each other. We would like to encourage all States to do likewise.  I am equally pleased to say that  since my Government came into office some 14 months ago  we have established relations with more than 27 countries and will continue to reach out to all countries to ensure that Solomon Islands remains connected in our interlinked world. On this note  I welcome a new member to our family of nations  South Sudan. We offer South Sudan our friendship and look forward to working with it on all issues of common concern to our countries.  The 51-year-old economic blockade of Cuba remains an issue stuck in time. Solomon Islands  in a spirit of friendship and in observation of the principle of good neighbourliness  makes a humble call on our partner and friend  the United States  for the unconditional lifting of the economic blockade against the people of Cuba. We request that the two States renew  restore  revive  redeem and reclaim their friendship and respect for each other’s sovereignty within the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter.  Solomon Islands will host the eleventh Festival of Pacific Arts next year to celebrate and promote the unique and diverse indigenous cultures of the Pacific. The Festival will give us an opportunity to express our sense of pride  awareness and recognition of the “Pacificness” of the isolated communities within the Pacific and to develop and preserve a deep sense of solidarity and unity through our ancient music  body art  dances and languages. We look forward to receiving our guests in 2012.  On the long-standing conflict in the holy land  Solomon Islands supports the work of the Quartet. We note that more than two-thirds of United Nations Member States recognize Palestine as a State. Solomon Islands  in the name of peace  believes that the international community must have the strength and stamina to act decisively  build on the two-State solution and overcome the distrust that exists in the region multilaterally.  On Security Council reform  Solomon Islands continues to support the intergovernmental negotiations on expansion in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats of the Council. My delegation is mindful of the fact that the most recent Security Council reform occurred in 1965. The world has changed since then. We need to streamline the current negotiating text within our informal intergovernmental negotiation process and join other small island developing States in calling for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council explicitly for small island developing States.  On the issue of human rights  I am pleased to say that Solomon Islands has submitted its national human rights report to the Human Rights Council. For a developing country  the right to development is the core of the country’s policy. Putting people at the centre of development  their meaningful participation and the fair distribution of national wealth and benefits will bring peace to an angry man  feed a hungry child and empower our womenfolk.  My delegation would like to acknowledge the change in nomenclature within the 53-member Group of Asian States to the Asia and the Pacific Small Islands Developing States Group. This is an important development and truly represents the diversity of membership that exists within the Asia Group. We applaud our Asian colleagues for taking such a decision.  On the issue of gender  Solomon Islands has huge challenges  to the extent that it will seek a regional seat    11-51372 16  within the Executive Board of United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. Solomon Islands is presenting its candidate as a Pacific SIDs-endorsed candidate  and with the support of the Assembly it hopes to give an LDC and SIDS flavour to the Board.  On Taiwan cross-strait relations  my delegation continues to commend the ongoing dialogue between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. We note Taiwan’s continuous contributions to the global health system in terms of a wide range of international development programmes  and welcome its participation as an observer to the World Health Assembly. We continue to call for such arrangements to be extended to other United Nations treaty bodies  including the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the meaningful participation of Taiwan and its people in the affairs of the international community. Solomon Islands also acknowledges Taiwan’s climate change mitigation and renewable energy programmes with developing countries  and would like to see the application of similar observer arrangements extended to Taiwan within the UNFCCC.  Let me conclude by expressing once again my delegation’s confidence in translating our global agenda into action within the next 12 months. Many lives depend on that. On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands  I assure the Assembly of our support and cooperation."
"154",6275,"SLE",66,2011,"I am honoured to address the Assembly once again. Let me  first of all  congratulate the President on his election to his duties of directing the affairs of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I would like to assure him of our full support and cooperation throughout his tenure. And I commend his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for a job well done. We appreciate the Secretary-General’s important contribution to the work of the Organization and congratulate him on his recent appointment to a second term.  On behalf of the Government and people of Sierra Leone  let me take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of South Sudan  the newest Member of the United Nations family and our continental organization  the African Union. We congratulate them on this achievement and wish them well.  Sierra Leone is a nation with a relatively small territory and population  but our aspirations to democracy  prosperity and international peace are as big as any nation’s  and our commitment to those ideals has been visibly demonstrated in the course of our 50 years as an independent nation. We are proud of the distinctive contributions we have made to the United Nations over the past half-century in areas such as decolonization; training and research; the international civil service; disarmament and non-proliferation  including small arms and light weapons; peacemaking and peacekeeping; the development of international law; and  currently  reform of the Security Council.  It is worth mentioning that  soon after our admission to the United Nations  we contributed a small peacekeeping contingent to the United Nations Operation in the Congo. Our commitment to international peace is evidenced by our transformation from a nation that received one of the largest ever United Nations peacekeeping missions in the late 1990s to a country that today contributes troops and police officers to peacekeeping missions in Darfur. We have also developed a proposal to participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia. At the same time  we acknowledge with gratitude the enormous impact that the United Nations family has had on the maintenance of peace  governance and economic and    11-51191 4  social development in my country since our admission to the Organization  50 years ago.  In my capacity as Chair of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the Reform of the United Nations Security Council  I must emphasize that reform of the Council is urgently required for the wider United Nations membership to fully benefit from the Council’s purposes and primary objective of maintaining international peace and security. There is an increasing need for the Security Council to be more representative  inclusive and democratic  as well as for an improvement in its working methods and its relations with the General Assembly. The status quo is increasingly unacceptable and has the potential to undermine the legitimacy  effectiveness and efficiency of the Council’s work in maintaining international peace and security.  It is therefore imperative that we reaffirm our commitment to the standards and principles of this noble Organization by generating the political will for a reformed Security Council that would pave the way for correcting the historical injustice done to Africa  through the allocation during this session of two permanent and five non-permanent seats to Africa  in accordance with the United Nations Charter.  Since I addressed the Assembly last year  Sierra Leone has continued to make steady progress  particularly in the priority sectors outlined in my Government’s agenda for change  namely  agriculture  energy  infrastructure  health and education. Those five sectors were purposely selected from many others requiring transformation because we believe they can have the greatest positive impact on the lives of our people. We have done so against the background of the unprecedented challenges facing our world today  such as the rise in fuel and food prices  the global financial crisis  and the chain of unending conflicts around the world.  Inspired by the conviction that no goals  however comprehensive or meaningful  can be achieved without the sustained determination to implement them  I have declared 2011 the year of implementation for Sierra Leone. Accordingly  my Government has demonstrated its commitment to that declaration. We are going to ensure that every single Sierra Leonean benefits from the dividends of our well-earned peace and democracy. In spite of the many challenges that have impeded our capacity to complete our projects  we are determined  with the cooperation and support of our development partners  to accelerate our country’s positive transformation. It is my sincere hope that successful implementation of the projects and programmes in the Joint Vision of the United Nations Family for Sierra Leone  which has been aligned with our agenda for change  will enhance Sierra Leone’s efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals.  The economy of Sierra Leone  like many around the world  is currently encountering budgetary difficulties that can be traced to the global economic meltdown. We are  however  optimistic about future growth levels. We expect export levels to increase  given our substantial investment in developing our infrastructure and ongoing revamping of our mining  agriculture and tourism sectors. We have also put in place strong corrective measures to stabilize the fiscal situation.  We have continued to build on progress achieved in the area of peace consolidation. Our democratic institutions  such as the National Electoral Commission  the Political Parties Registration Commission and the Anti-Corruption Commission  have continued to make progress in carrying out their respective mandates. We have also continued to build on gains achieved in the areas of human rights  gender equality and women’s empowerment.  The establishment of a Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone and the presentation of our national report to the Universal Periodic Review Working Group of the United Nations Human Rights Council in May this year are clear manifestations of our commitment to build a human rights regime that respects international norms and practices. In June this year  the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions awarded an “A” status accreditation to the Human Rights Commission of Siena Leone in recognition of its achievements and independence.  I have pledged my support and initiated processes that will make women constitute at least 30 per cent of elective offices in our country. As a State party to many international human rights instruments we are committed to their implementation and respect our reporting obligations under the relevant conventions. We have  for instance  just completed our sixth periodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. We have ratified the   5 11-51191  United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and have commissioned a National Action Plan for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008).  As we prepare for our 2012 presidential  parliamentary and local council elections  we are cognizant of the fact that it is our primary responsibility to organize and provide the necessary logistical requirements for this democratic process. However  we need all necessary international assistance in support of our commitment to ensure free  fair and peaceful elections. In that regard  we have continued to dialogue with all stakeholders including the National Electoral Commission  the Political Parties Registration Commission and political parties. We remain committed to peace  security and development  but the need to continue with national capacity-building programmes in priority peacebuilding thematic areas beyond the 2012 elections remains critical.  Recently  peace and stability were not only threatened but painfully disturbed by pockets of armed conflict in the subregion of the Economic Community of West African States  particularly in the Mano River Union basin. However  we are encouraged by the unfolding developments and prospects of relative peace in our sister republics. At the same time  we are concerned about the continued threats posed to peace and stability by the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons across our subregion. International cooperation and assistance are necessary in order to eradicate this menace. Sierra Leone  for its part  recently launched a five-year action plan to expand the scope of its activities concerning small arms and light weapons.  Considering the prevailing incidence of violence and armed conflict in various regions of the world  the choice of the theme  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes”  for this year’s general debate is relevant and appropriate.  Of course  we are quite conscious of the inevitability of disputes in the conduct of inter-State as well as intra-State relations. But it is imperative to respect the set of principles enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations in our interactions with each other. They include the sovereign equality of all United Nations Members  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the prohibition of the threat or use of force.  Obviously  mediation remains the best mechanism for the prevention and settlement of armed conflicts. It should be utilized to the fullest extent possible. Sierra Leone firmly believes that the United Nations should make better use of Chapter VI of the Charter  namely  measures for the peaceful settlement of disputes.  We must also allow our discussion of the mediation of disputes through peaceful means to move towards the resolution of threats to the international economic and financial systems. The greatest threat today to the security of most individuals in most societies stems from the non-resolution of issues relating to excessive speculation in the most important food crops of the world  the rising food and fuel prices and the fact that the burden of sacrifice for our recovery is increasingly placed on the shoulders of the weak and the poor.   In most places in the world we are seeing the rallying of the strong and powerful to protect their indulgence and the rallying of young people  the weak and the dispossessed to secure their very lives  their dignity and humanity. The alternatives to the non-resolution of those disputes are dire. We must act now to save the world from the anger of the weak and the excessive indulgence and repression perpetrated by the strong.  I would like to emphasize that international cooperation in the peaceful settlement of disputes is the life blood of our Organization. In all our deliberations  from global warming to human trafficking  from the threats of nuclear weapons to the scourge of abject poverty  from communicable and non-communicable diseases to ruthless natural disasters  and from the flow of illicit drugs to the seemingly unending upheavals in the financial markets  we should always remember that we need each other. The world is too connected for the consequences of failure to be localized.   The effects of poverty  disease  hunger and desperation can no longer be boxed in and contained in a corner of a city  or a country  region or continent. We are on each other’s doorsteps  and we must continue to build the structures for the peaceful resolution of our conflicts."
"155",6322,"SLV",66,2011,"This new session of the Assembly of the United Nations brings us together at what is no doubt an historic time of great importance  as has been said in one way or another by the various leaders who have preceded me at this rostrum. These are certainly critical times that should lead us to adopt an attitude that goes beyond addressing the specific questions of the moment  because this is a moment of change in the history of humankind. On the economic  social and geopolitical levels there are many signs indeed that show us that the world is changing and that the transition towards something new  even if still undefined  is already under way and will follow its course  whether we are able to understand it or not.   That is why our peoples desire political leadership that is able to respond to this time of uncertainty. Our societies demand of us that we be able  first of all  to understand and explain to them what is really going on. They also demand of us that we listen to their needs and satisfy those needs and  above all  that we reach a new international consensus in order to make that necessary qualitative global leap in order to achieve a planet of greater justice  stability and safety.   This is  therefore  an opportunity to reconsider our policies  to review and change paradigms that seem to be frozen  to renew the international debate and to be ambitious in our aspirations as a global society. Members know that nothing undermines the morale and spirit of our peoples more than fear  uncertainty and distrust. It is those evils that are affecting our planet currently. We are suffering from fear in its various guises. Millions of demoralized  unemployed people live in daily uncertainty  not knowing whether there is a future for them and their children. Entire countries have seen their economies stumble because of that lack of confidence. Hundreds of thousands of families every day face the fear that takes the form of political instability  natural disasters  the lack of urban    11-51185 12  safety  and poverty. All those people demand that their leaders give them the inspiration to overcome that fear  to regain a sense of collective self-esteem and to believe in a different and better future. That is the great historical challenge that we must shoulder with responsibility and courage.  We must forge a new international agreement that will allow us to overcome such fears and lack of confidence in order once again to stride forward. Therefore we must not allow that fear to be translated into timid or cowardly political and economic decisions that would deprive us of an opportunity to undertake the changes that our people are calling for. We must not betray their historic will for transformation and development. It would be unpardonable  unforgivable  if we were to allow ourselves to be lulled by old political and economic dogma and continue repeating once again the same mistakes  while overwhelming majorities in every city  in every State  on every continent  have clearly expressed their desire for a new  audacious and creative policy.  Over the past 30 years  while the economy has grown exponentially  so has the root cause of many of our misfortunes  and here I am referring to injustice. Daily injustice has a most significant effect on our peoples. It affects their options for health  education and social development in very tangible ways. That inequality has disastrous consequences  which has been tried  tested and understood by some of the wealthiest entrepreneurs  who are in favour of paying more taxes  as they are aware that adopting any other position would sentence us to a harsh future  even for those living at ease.   The fight against poverty and inequality  as was recalled at the inaugural meeting of this session of the General Assembly by the President of Brazil  Dilma Rousseff  has proven to be the strongest economic policy in these difficult times. Therefore  it is time that we no longer see our future in terms of macroeconomic data but that we start to focus our political debate on our peoples’ needs and on social justice  which is what the debate should always have focused on. Any other debate would be sterile and would only lead us away from the common objective that should govern all our policies  namely  the objective of the common good.  The unstable reality that we have experienced also takes the form of conflicts which  increasingly  call upon the indistinct arbiter  who goes by the name of the “international community” and which is represented here in the General Assembly better than anywhere else. In that regard I welcome the fact that one of the central themes of this session is the search for the peaceful settlement of conflicts and prevention strategies to cope with situations of instability. This shows us that the arbiter is growing stronger  as are the possibilities to prevent injustice and human rights abuses wherever they occur. The United Nations arose out of the global desire to avoid a new major conflict  and that spirit of peace and harmony must continue to guide us in our actions  even when the conflicts that we face currently are very different from the conflicts of the twentieth century. Indeed  we are living in a most diverse and complex world where there are no magical formulas or quick fixes but common responsibility  which is committed to finding new avenues for peacemaking and justice extending beyond our national borders.   That resolve must also translate into our quest for solutions to what is one of the oldest conflicts on this planet  and I am referring here to the Arab-Israeli conflict. As members know  my country recently decided to recognize the Palestinian State. This in no way seeks to undermine our good diplomatic relations with Israel. We are of the view that both peoples have the right and duty to coexist. Recognizing Palestine as a new State within the United Nations is  in my opinion  the right way to contribute to resolving the conflict. With this firm belief we support all diplomatic efforts that are aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of this long-standing conflict. We firmly believe that dialogue is the only possible solution  and our actions have always been guided by that principle.  Now I should like to refer to the main enemy  not only of my country and Central America but of a large portion of the American continent. I am referring here  of course  to organized crime and drugs trafficking. As was rightly stated by President Calderón of Mexico following the terrible attack that occurred in a casino in Monterrey  we are facing a veritable phenomenon of terrorism that threatens the viability of our countries  has taken more lives than many wars  and which endangers the present and future of our peoples. Many Latin American countries represented here have become  against their will  true corridors for illegal trafficking  thus becoming nations increasingly affected by violence  with institutions that are   13 11-51185  susceptible to corruption. Because of their poor economies of scale  their lack of development and the weakness of their productive machinery owing to widespread poverty and high levels of inequality  poor States are threatened by this new form of terrorism that has forged a strong economic network. All of the cartels that are operating in the Mesoamerican region — Mexico and Central America — possess more money and influence than our countries do.  It is true to say that we are the true victims of organized crime. It is our territories and peoples that suffer from this violence and who weep for their dead. These are not mere empty statements. Studies have shown that violence and crime are 100 per cent more likely in regions that facilitate illegal trafficking than anywhere else on the planet. Our countries are suffering as a result of this. El Salvador and all of Central America are undertaking significant efforts to deal with this fact but the figures are not on our side. We are speaking of a drug-trafficking route that moves $100 billion a year and which leads to the largest market in the world  as well as the largest consumer of these substances  the United States. Consider this: $100 billion across our territories along with a veritable arsenal of weapons to protect this amount. That means $100 billion dollars that can corrupt public and private officials  destroy our social fabric and leave behind them a daily wake of chaos and death.   How therefore can countries such as El Salvador with a gross domestic product of about $22 billion  or a country such as Honduras with roughly $15 billion  or Guatemala which barely reaches $40 billion  deal with this enemy? Not even a large country such as Mexico can successfully wage this battle on its own in dealing with this terrorist strength. It is not scepticism that leads me to speak this way but rather a sense of realism in keeping with the reality experienced by Central American peoples on a daily basis.  I wish to draw attention to this. The international community must understand that it is also affected by this problem. No nation on this planet is spared this problem. There are drug users in every nation in the world  who get their drugs from the criminal drug-trafficking networks. That means that the fight against organized crime is a common struggle and  in that regard  I wish to make a special and hopeful call upon the people and Government of the United States resolutely to lead us in this the good fight against drug-trafficking and organized crime. I believe that the Government of the United States must lead us in the struggle with great resolve. It must make the commitment and apply all its economic  human  technological and political resources in waging the struggle  which is indeed the harshest war to affect our continent.  The violence that is fuelled by drugs trafficking and by its machinery of death has taken more lives in Mesoamerica than conflicts that occur elsewhere on this planet. That is why I wish to draw attention to and invite all Members to focus on this shocking fact. We require the firm resolve of our great North American neighbour in order to strike the necessary blows to weaken and end this criminal phenomenon. Naturally  that does not mean that our countries will in any way shirk their share of the responsibility. We shall continue to strengthen our institutions  to reform our security forces  to strengthen our presence on the ground in order to protect our young people from criminal gangs. At the regional level we are working together and have undertaken significant steps in a common undertaking by sharing strategies and tasks with Mexico  Colombia and the United States.  Of course  these are truly difficult challenges that lie ahead. Many of these challenges were referred to by the President of Mexico — the fight against money-laundering  disarmament  crime prevention  an effective judiciary — and will require the reform of our judicial organs. Inevitably  organized crime has infiltrated the organs of the State  in particular the judiciary and the police forces. That is why we must wage a strong fight in order to clean up those institutions.  But the consumer countries  in this case chiefly the United States  are morally responsible in this struggle that must be seen not only as a criminal problem but also as a matter of public health. While drugs consumption and narcotics use grow  the business of drugs trafficking will remain powerful. In short  we call once again for North American leadership in this common struggle that we are waging alongside Mexico  Colombia and all of Central America.   Struggles such as these  which are being waged across the American continent  once again show how important it is to have a strong and united America. Unity is a necessary prerequisite in order to meet our common goals. Given this need  I now wish to refer to    11-51185 14  the blockade against the Republic of Cuba. We believe that this blockade is an anachronism from a past page of history that we wish to turn once and for all. Essentially a blockade against Cuba is a step towards disunity. It is a stumbling block on the road of history that weakens us as a continent.  At the start of my statement I spoke of the leadership that our peoples expect from us in these difficult times  of the courage that we need in order to face the challenges that extend beyond our borders and also of this great opportunity before us now. Let us show that leadership  from the smallest country  such as my own  to the great Powers. Let us show an unequivocal will to achieve peace  social justice and the well-being of the men and women who place their faith in us  in particular in times such as these when crisis once again threatens our peoples. Let us not fail them once more. We should not favour those in power who triggered the crisis but rather the weakest  who are affected by it."
"156",6347,"SMR",66,2011,"On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino  I wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His long experience as Ambassador of Qatar to the United Nations and his deep knowledge of this Organization will be valuable resources in helping us move ahead with the reforms needed in the most important areas of United Nations activity. Over the past few years  Qatar has played a significant mediation role in the Arab world. The delegation of San Marino will cooperate fully in the work to be done.  I also wish to sincerely thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his energy and praiseworthy efforts  for the interest he constantly displays in all United Nations Member States  and for his constant and crucial presence in every politically important situation and emergency worldwide. His reappointment to a second term is important to promoting reform of the United Nations  guaranteeing the Organization’s full effectiveness and preventing any action aimed at decentralizing global governance.  I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for the excellent work done by the United Nations  under the careful and effective leadership of the Secretary-General  in South Sudan. By putting an end to the violence and atrocities that have plagued that part of Africa for several years  the United Nations action led to the Republic of South Sudan’s declaration of independence and its admission to our Organization as a new Member in July.  On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the tragic attack on the World Trade Center in New York  I would like to stress the importance of effectively combating terrorism and taking action to prevent the formation and development of terrorist groups. A   5 11-51670  crucial task of policymakers is to create conditions in which terrorism cannot find a breeding ground.  This year’s theme of the general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  unquestionably represents the purposes of diplomacy and the fundamental reason why States decided to cooperate within the framework of international bodies and mechanisms  headed by the United Nations. In a certain sense  it is also closely connected to the reform process of our Organization.  The principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes between States is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in many General Assembly resolutions  and the Republic of San Marino can only support that principle. Indeed  our country has always tried to settle conflicts by peaceful means and has always believed in the power of dialogue  democracy and tolerance — values on which peaceful coexistence among peoples is based. With a view to achieving this principle in order to maintain international peace and security  the Republic of San Marino supports the role and authority of the General Assembly and the Security Council.  This year we have witnessed a massive popular uprising spreading across the squares of cities in North Africa and the Middle East. These are protests for democracy and freedom  respect for human rights and social justice. At the forefront of this revolution are young people from the middle classes. Despite their education  they have found themselves excluded from the labour market or suffering under poor working conditions.  The unusual scale of the Arab revolution  which has taken the world by surprise  demonstrates that major political and institutional changes are needed  because our economic and social foundations have also changed as a result of globalization. We cannot consider this spontaneous uprising of people looking for freedom  justice and democracy only in terms of security. If the United Nations intends to play a pivotal role in managing global governance  it should also be able to interpret the need for such changes and to support them  as far as possible. San Marino believes that the United Nations must continue to play a leading role in managing global governance. The deeply democratic nature of our Organization  with its universal participation and undisputed legitimacy  as well as the richness and diversity of cultures and traditions that are represented here  allow us to adopt an approach aimed at harmonizing the interests of the entire international community and at achieving sustainable human development.  The global economic and financial crisis  the devastating consequences of which are evident to all  has unfortunately demonstrated that our existing institutions are unable to respond rapidly and adequately to such crises. This has led to a growth in the influence of some informal groups  such as the Group of Eight and the Group of 20 (G-20)  on the management of global economic governance. San Marino is grateful to those groups and for the role they have played.   However  we believe it important to emphasize that in their decision-making process  which should be more transparent and inclusive  it is essential that they take into account the interests  worries and aspirations of States outside their groups  particularly developing countries. The actions of such informal groups should be complementary to those of the United Nations  which will require the development of specific mechanisms to regulate their relations with our Organization. We welcome the Secretary-General’s participation in the G-20 meetings and the consultations held by the rotating presidencies with the United Nations. However  we stress the importance of transparency in relations between these informal groups and the United Nations system  the only Organization in a position to take decisions whose legitimacy no one can challenge.  The Republic of San Marino is concerned about the consequences of the economic and financial crisis and other crises closely and inevitably linked to it. Unemployment is a very serious problem that faces every country without distinction. Furthermore  in many States the youth unemployment rate is twice as high as that for adults. Long-term unemployment has also risen in the past few years. We believe that the United Nations should pay special attention to the issue of unemployment.   Unfortunately  the negative effects of the global economic and financial crisis are still visible today. Although the international economy experienced a modest recovery last year  we have not yet emerged from the 2008 crisis. And beyond the problem of unemployment  we are now confronting a global sovereign debt crisis.    11-51670 6   Is there a good recipe for recovery from the crisis? Is a rigorous economic policy sufficient? Do innovative measures for relaunching the world’s economy exist? Can these measures be shared  or are we facing a deep systemic crisis requiring an in-depth analysis of the way our societies function and a rethinking of current business models? I believe that if the United Nations focused on these important issues  its leading role in global governance could not be questioned by anyone.  The destinies of our peoples are linked to global threats in an increasingly direct way. Today  the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss  economic  financial and employment crises  food security  public health  disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons and the fight against terrorism are recognized as being interdependent. On that basis  we should create a new form of international cooperation and multilateralism so as to coordinate our policies at the international  national and regional levels. We have a duty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the Organization’s activities with a view to preserving and strengthening its essential value as a point of reference for the international community.  The interdependence of such threats is more evident now than ever before. That is the case  for example  of the impact of climate change on world food security  which in turn poses a threat to security and peace  not only in Africa  where perhaps this relationship can more easily be observed  but throughout the world. Food insecurity fuels violent social conflicts. Climate change leads to a reduction in global food production  the most damaging effects of which are experienced in Africa and Asia.  The populations of countries in a post-conflict situation  countries that depend more directly on agriculture or the poorest developing countries will have more difficulties than others in coping with rising food prices due to droughts or other disasters caused by climate change. Our country is following the humanitarian emergency in the Horn of Africa with great concern. The populations of Somalia  Kenya  Ethiopia and Djibouti are the victims of a severe drought. This is a humanitarian emergency affecting over 12 million people  including many women and children.  The Republic of San Marino is grateful to the Secretary-General for his rapid and significant actions in benefit of the affected populations. We also thank the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Central Emergency Response Fund for their immediate response and their substantial contribution to resolving the humanitarian emergency in the Horn of Africa  and Member States for their financial commitments.  Another but no less important effect of climate change is sea-level rise  which has an impact on the very existence of many Member States. This problem affects not only small islands  but also large islands and countries with extensive coastlines. Therefore  this phenomenon affects a significant number of United Nations Member States.  The implications  interdependence and effects of serious global threats on populations and world peace and security are increasingly evident. With a view to addressing such challenges  we need a strong United Nations  as well as effective and coordinated action in our economic  environmental and food policies at all levels — both globally and regionally. These policies should be designed to achieve sustainable  inclusive and equitable economic growth.   As I mentioned earlier  this year’s theme is inevitably linked to the reform of the United Nations. That reform will be fundamental to future world stability and the maintenance of international peace and security. It must remain the target of all our efforts.   The Republic of San Marino has been following with interest the Security Council reform process since 1994. In that regard  it is grateful to Ambassador Tanin for the wisdom and impartiality with which he has presided over the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform and for his tireless efforts to reach the broadest possible political agreement. We are convinced that intergovernmental negotiations are the right framework within which to find a solution that reflects the interests and positions of all Members. It is essential to move beyond respective initial positions in order to negotiate the broadest possible agreement. The Republic San Marino believes that the five key issues of reform — categories of membership  the question of the veto  regional representation  the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods  and its relationship with the General Assembly — are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole.   Another major reform in the United Nations to which our country attaches great importance is the   7 11-51670  revitalization process of the General Assembly. The Republic of San Marino supports this reform process and  in that regard  wishes to thank Lithuania and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for having co-chaired the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the General Assembly this year.  The revitalization of the General Assembly is a politically necessary reform and  at the same time  essential to the future of the United Nations. It is a reform that should involve all States in reaching an agreement based  again  on the broadest possible political consensus and aimed at reaffirming the central role of the General Assembly as the most representative body of the United Nations  as well as the role and leadership of its President. Reform should make the work of the General Assembly more effective  prevent duplication of its activities  and improve its relations with the other United Nations bodies. Nevertheless  the revitalization of the General Assembly should not concern these aspects alone  however important they may be. The Assembly should become a key forum where solutions can be found to the problems posed by the global threats that increasingly unite the destinies of our peoples.  There are many issues and themes on which the United Nations focuses its attention  and it is impossible to address all of them. Therefore  I will highlight some aspects that are perhaps lesser known  but no less important.  About 15 per cent of the world’s population has some kind of disability  while between 2 to 4 per cent suffers from severe disabilities. Since the adoption in 2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  we have witnessed a clear affirmation of the rights of the disabled. Today  the Convention has been ratified by over 100 countries. The international community has taken important steps forward in terms of equality for and non-discrimination towards disabled people  as well as their full inclusion and participation in the social  political and cultural life of societies. However  much remains to be done in order to implement the Convention  including the establishment of legislative frameworks and policies at the national and international levels.  The international community should also deal with the strong relationship between disability and poverty  and include that issue in future political strategies. A similar approach is fundamental in efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At present  80 per cent of persons with disabilities live in developing countries and most live below the poverty line. In addition  many of the children who do not attend school have some kind of disability. Therefore  it is clear that targeted strategies and policies taking into due account the situation of children with disabilities should be adopted to achieve the Goal of universal primary education.   More than 8 million children under five years of age and 350 000 mothers die every year. Today  67 million children are still out of school  and 195 million children under five years of age suffer from chronic malnutrition  which remains the major cause of childhood death. Every day  more than 1 000 babies are born with HIV and about 5 million young people between 15 and 24 years of age are living with this virus.  Children continue to be the most vulnerable to and most affected by violence  abuse and exploitation. Currently  more than 200 million children  especially those in developing countries  do not have a birth certificate. Sadly  most can barely access basic services  such as health care and education  or enjoy their rights. Also  it is difficult to protect them. This threatens to seriously undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of San Marino joins the international community in supporting resolution 65/1  entitled “Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals”.   Gender equality is rightly placed high on the agenda of the United Nations. In many countries  maternal mortality figures are still worrying  especially in the poorest areas of the world. Furthermore  young people  girls and women are the most affected by HIV. Unfortunately  trafficking in women and children remains a serious problem. Women and girls continue to be subjected to humiliating practices  such as the payment of the bride price  child marriage  kidnapping and sexual violence  including domestic violence.  Protecting the rights of women in conflict and post-conflict situations continues to be another high priority for the United Nations. Women facing such situations are very often victims of sexual violence  mass rape  torture and arbitrary executions.   Schooling and education are vital to countering discrimination and favour the empowerment of women.    11-51670 8  Improving the quality of and access to education for women and children requires providing them with instruments to improve their economic and social living conditions.  I have talked about groups of people who live in extremely difficult conditions in many areas of the world and represent a very large share of the world’s population. The primary task of each individual and State is to support every effort to help them live in decent conditions and feelfully included in society. Their progress will be our progress  and their smile will be the light allowing us to look to the future with optimism. "
"157",6384,"SOM",66,2011,"Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his appointment to a second term. We Somalis would like to thank him for his leadership in putting Somalia at the top of the agenda despite so many competing priorities. We hope that Somalia will become peaceful and stable during his tenure.  It is my honour to address the General Assembly for the first time as Prime Minister of Somalia. I come here mindful of the enormous challenges at this important moment in our history and determined to act   19 11-51372  boldly in the cause of peace  justice and stability — not only in the Horn of Africa but on the African continent at large and in the world as a whole.  The United Nations was founded on the conviction that the nations of the world could come together in a spirit of cooperation to tackle their common problems for the sake of the whole of humankind. I wish to speak of the challenges facing Somalia  whose effects have found ample expression in the current dire situation in the country  and some of which threaten every country represented here.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister of Turkey for his genuine leadership and for highlighting the plight and suffering of those affected by the famine in Somalia. The seemingly unending humanitarian crisis in Somalia has many and varied causes. Decades of conflict  the demise of the central State  poor and kleptocratic leadership and struggles between clans for limited resources  exacerbated by cycles of devastating droughts  have created chronic food shortages and an underdeveloped economy  and driven the population to despair.  In recent years  the global terrorist organization Al-Qaida has sought to exploit these divisions and weaknesses to plot and carry out attacks on the rest of the world. Our people know only too well the destruction that a few  blinded by an ideology of extremism and terror  can wreak on a country. It is this small minority  and primarily the Al-Qaida affiliated group Al-Shabaab  that is responsible for the famine currently spreading throughout the country  through their policies of systematically looting grain stores  forcibly recruiting and extorting farmers and their families and preventing access by aid agencies to the most affected regions in the south.  However  the threat they pose is not limited to our borders. Foreign fighters have sought to export their noxious extremism to the rest of the Horn of Africa  recruiting and sponsoring acts of terror in neighbouring countries such as Uganda  where last year they murdered 76 innocent people. The insecurity they have created in southern Somalia has led to a large influx of refugees into Kenya and Ethiopia  straining resources and spreading instability across the region.  They are also actively planning to strike further afield. Just this week  one of the leaders of Al-Shabaab said that the group was committed to continuing its battle against the Government of Somalia and was seeking to destroy both the United States and the United Nations. It is also well-known that Al-Shabaab has been focusing its recruitment and radicalization efforts on Somali diasporas in Australia  Europe  Canada and the United States of America.  Clearly  the battle against Al-Qaida is one in which we all have a stake  and in which we all therefore have responsibilities. In Somalia  we have been doing what we can  within our limited resources  to fulfil our obligations in this regard. Barely a month after United States forces killed Osama bin Laden  one of his most wanted deputies  Fazul Abdullah Mohammed  was shot dead by Somali security forces on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Shortly thereafter  with the aid of African Union forces  the Somali National Army succeeded in forcing the extremists to withdraw the bulk of their forces from the capital. As a result  we can now begin to provide needed humanitarian assistance to the city’s ever-increasing population of internally displaced persons  who are fleeing the areas still held by the extremists where the famine has hit hardest.  Although the extremists’ retreat from Mogadishu is a welcome development  it may herald a new and more dangerous phase of the conflict  as they increasingly turn to asymmetric tactics such as suicide bombings and the use of improvised explosive devices that target the civilian population. As we continue to build up our own capacities  our security agencies are alert to this threat and have already successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks  including several targeting the hungry at feeding centres.  Terrorism preys on decaying States  exploiting their poverty and ungoverned spaces to radicalize  recruit and plan. That is why the extremists have consistently fought against the Somali peace process and sought to destroy the institutions it has generated. Somalia’s leaders are redoubling their efforts to achieve national reconciliation and entrench democratic governance. Three weeks ago  with the help of our international partners  we hosted the first national consultative conference in Mogadishu  at which the Transitional Institutions and representatives of regional administrations came together to adopt a road map for the re-establishment of permanent  legitimate and representative Government in the country.    11-51372 20   The conference  which was the culmination of Somali-led reconciliation initiatives dating back to the Arta Declaration of May 2000  represents the best hope for Somalia to establish a firm political foundation from which to rebuild. The road map is a significant achievement for the Somali peace process. Its adoption marks the first of many steps on the path to the eventual conclusion of the transition process in a responsible and productive manner. It has also shed light on the remaining transitional tasks  including the drafting and promulgation of a new Constitution. The Transitional Federal Institutions have committed to meeting the specific timelines and benchmarks for their implementation as outlined in the road map  which will allow the Somali people to monitor our performance in this regard.  The support of the international community is also crucial to ensuring its success. Indeed  the conference itself could not have taken place without the continued engagement of the international community. Let me also take this opportunity to express gratitude  on behalf of my entire nation  to the African Union  and especially Uganda and Burundi  for the support they have given and the sacrifices they have made to date in this worthy cause. The fact that the conference was safely held in Mogadishu is testimony to the achievements in security that their forces have made possible in the city. I must also thank all the countries represented here for the bilateral and multilateral support given to both the Transitional Institutions and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)  without which none of what has been achieved would have been possible.  Going forward  as we embark on the final leg of the transition process  we will continue to need the help and support of the United Nations. The road map has illuminated the path and  although dangers may lie in the shadows  we will not deviate from it. We ask that the Organization continue to accompany us on this journey and to provide the needed resources as we advance towards full sovereignty.  Despite the remarkable progress we have made so far  our gains remain fragile and consolidating them will require resilience and unity from all. It is critical that the Somali Army and AMISOM be reinforced as soon as possible  so they can prevent a security vacuum in the areas of Mogadishu recently vacated by the fleeing extremists  and ensure that the city is safe for both residents and aid workers. The immediate deployment of the extra 3 000 AMISOM troops already authorized by the Security Council will be a crucial first step.  In addition  we must also begin to show the people the fruits of peace and democracy and to reverse the harmful effects of radicalization. Somalia needs the help of the outside world to rebuild its economy and provide jobs for the millions of our young people who have been deprived of opportunities by the anarchy of the past two decades. We must show them that there is a better alternative to the barrel of a gun.  The effort must begin at home. Let me be the first to acknowledge that we Somalis have made mistakes in the past  which eroded the international community’s trust in our institutions. Somalia can and must do better. In this time of national crisis  we the Somali people must set aside our differences and come together to confront our perils. Reconciliation must become our mantra as we work to further the peace process and create an environment conducive to the delivery of aid. We in the political class must also accept our responsibility for the errors of the past and resolve to do better. The Somali people have had enough of war  hunger  political wrangling and corruption. They demand  and indeed deserve  a Government that puts the national interest before personal ambition — one that fosters unity  not division.  The Transitional Federal Government is making efforts to reverse this and to instil a sense of patriotism and responsibility. We are making good progress in injecting professionalism and transparency into the revenue collection and economic management system  strengthening internal mechanisms governing the distribution of Government money and creating a more open and accountable fiscal and monetary system.   The Central Bank of Somalia is up and running. The economic reforms we have made have resulted in the doubling of revenue from the Mogadishu seaport and quadrupled those from the Aden International Airport. The funds are being reinvested in the provision of services to the people as our current capability allows. For example  15 per cent of the revenue collected from the seaport has been set aside for the rehabilitation of the city. As a result  for the first time in 20 years  Mogadishu is being cleared of rubble  roads are being repaired and streets lit  and   21 11-51372  markets  hospitals and schools are reopening. A register containing the names and biometric data of all the members of the security forces has been compiled  and our soldiers are receiving their allowances regularly.  As required by the road map  we have also embarked on the process of identifying nominees for the Interim Independent Anti-Corruption Commission. We are also formulating a national fiscal budget for the coming fiscal year.  As with the gains in the security sector  in order to entrench and safeguard these reforms and to deliver on the expectations of the Somali people  we in the Transitional Federal Government must improve on our performance and create the necessary conditions for the growth of the Somali economy. However  the scale of the challenge is such that we will continue to rely on the help of our international partners.   It is understandable that  in the prevailing global economic environment  many in the wealthier countries will be tempted to look to their own problems  to the detriment of providing aid and investment to their poorer cousins in the developing world. I would caution against this. The visionaries who founded this body understood that it was impossible to secure economic benefits for a section of the global population as long as these remained a distant dream for the rest  and sought to establish an interlinked global political and economic infrastructure that ensured that citizens in every country could participate in  and partake of the fruits of  global prosperity. I therefore urge the international community to continue its generous support for the emerging economic institutions  as we strive to rebuild destroyed infrastructure and jump-start economic activity in the areas our forces are securing.  To the business community I would say that Somalia is truly Africa’s sleeping giant  and a relatively small investment there will go a long way. With the longest coastline on the continent  bountiful and unexploited natural wealth and an entrepreneurial tradition that dates back to the Roman times  a peaceful Somalia will be a force for moderation and an engine of growth and prosperity for the region and for the continent.   Furthermore  the integration of Somalia into the global economy will have a considerable and beneficial impact on the phenomenon of piracy from our shores  which imposes huge costs on global trade. As has been noted by many observers  a lasting solution to this menace is not to be found in policing the high seas. The regeneration of a vibrant economy on land  providing jobs and opportunity for all  is the sole antidote.   The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains dire. The United Nations has declared famine in a sixth region  which means that up to half the population is now facing the prospect of starvation. Many of our people continue to come to the capital seeking refuge  with more than half a million others having already arrived. To deal with this situation and to oversee the delivery of humanitarian assistance  a high-level committee has been created. As per its recommendations  the Government has established several camps to house and feed refugees. A disaster management agency  comprised of members of civil society  has also been established. We are working with United Nations agencies such as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme to synchronize our efforts to deal with the famine.  On behalf of the entire Somali nation  I wish to express my gratitude for the pledges of assistance that we have received from Governments and humanitarian agencies around the world. The greatest need  however  continues to be felt within areas still under the effective control of the extremists  where access by international humanitarian agencies is severely restricted. The insurgents are also hampering the freedom of movement of millions who are trying to reach help  either in Mogadishu or in neighbouring countries.  Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Without urgent interventions to change the situation  it is estimated that up to three quarters of a million people may perish in the next few months. Although normal to above-normal rainfall is expected to return in the next three months  that is unlikely to result in a significant easing of the crisis in the short term  since the harvest will not be expected until February. In any case  the production from the short rainy season only accounts for a third of the total annual cereal production. The displacement of farmers by the current famine will only further reduce the expected yield. In fact  the United Nations has    11-51372 22  indicated that it expects the famine to spread to the rest of the south by the end of the year.  It is therefore critical that we accelerate efforts to reach those in Al-Shabaab-controlled areas  while at the same time ensuring that international humanitarian workers are afforded a measure of security against attacks and kidnappings by the insurgents. As I noted earlier  the international community must urgently reinforce our efforts to extend the zone of safety for aid workers beyond Mogadishu and into these areas. In the meantime  my Government will continue to work closely with humanitarian agencies to collect and share information on needs. We stand ready to cooperate with all actors to ensure that aid gets to the most critically affected populations  wherever they may be.  As I stated before  the challenges I have outlined have been aggravated by the increasing cycles of devastating drought that we experience as a result of changes in global climate patterns. We in the Horn of Africa have been affected more than most. As I speak  the region is experiencing its worst drought in a generation. The scale of the suffering in my country is a testament to price we are having to pay.  There needs to be a concerted effort not just to address the causes of climate change but also to mitigate its adverse effects  especially in countries such as Somalia that have contributed little to the problem but are bearing the brunt of its consequences. In that regard  let me reiterate the appeal issued during the recent summit on the Horn of Africa crisis  held in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi  for developed nations to facilitate the transfer of technology and build up the capacity of developing nations to adapt to these challenges. Somalia will require assistance to improve water resource management and reduce our reliance on rain-fed agriculture even as we strive to implement the targets agreed to at the Nairobi summit of 10 per cent forest cover and irrigated land by the year 2017.  Moreover  we fully support the right of Palestine to become a full member of the community of nations. We believe in the two-State solution for the Palestinian-Israeli problem  where Palestinians should be allowed to live in peace and dignity in their own homeland. We have all seen the changes happening in the Arab world. The international community must support the peaceful and democratic aspirations of all peoples.   We must also support the National Transitional Council of Libya in order to bring peace and stability to that country.  In conclusion  today  the future of Somalia hangs in the balance  and with it the prospects for peace  stability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa and security for nations across the world. Resolute global action in support of our efforts is now required if we are to consolidate and build on the gains already made and extend them to the rest of the country for the sake of future generations."
"158",6390,"SSD",66,2011,"Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this sixty-sixth session. We wish him every success during his term of office. In the same way  we congratulate the Secretary-General on having been re-elected to a second term because of the confidence he has won from the people of the United Nations.  I have not been involved in global issues  being the representative of the youngest nation in this family of nations. Our country is just two months and 14 days old today. Members can see how many problems and challenges are ahead of us. I wish at the outset to avail myself of this opportunity and the privilege of addressing this stellar gathering to reiterate  on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of the Republic of South Sudan  our most sincere and profound gratitude to the entire international community for the warmth with which our State has been welcomed into the community of nations. My people back home in South Sudan  and I personally here in New York  regard this significant moment as yet another milestone on the long list of our achievements.   The President returned to the Chair.  I should like to seize this opportunity also once again to salute the many who stood with us during our long struggle. We are indebted to many friends in this great Hall  without whose efforts it would not have been easy for us to get where we are today. We owe a debt of gratitude to the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)  the troika States  and the friends and partners of IGAD  who waged a struggle for peace for the Sudan that culminated in the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. As an emergent nation that has been embroiled in conflict during different periods of time  all of which add up to more than five decades  the Republic of South Sudan stands in dire need of all the help it can get.   In most post-conflict situations  nations would normally expect to rebuild. That is not the case for us. Even before the ravages of war set in  our country had nothing worth rebuilding. Hence  we characterize our   21 11-51185  post-conflict mission as one of construction rather than reconstruction  and we therefore hope that the overwhelming outpouring of support and sympathy that greeted our independence from all corners of the globe will translate into tangible development assistance for South Sudan. Our march out of the abyss of poverty and deprivation into the realm of progress and prosperity is going to be a long one  and that is why we need members to partner us on this difficult journey.  Although nature has endowed our country with some resources  notably oil and other mineral wealth  we hardly produce anything for ourselves — at least not yet. We are determined to diversify the economy of our country and lessen our precarious and near total dependence on oil. Our strategy is to use the oil as a catalyst to unlock the potential we have in other areas  especially in agriculture.  Oil is a non-renewable resource that will inevitably be depleted at some point in the future  but we know that the land  water and human resources at our disposal will continue to be our country’s true  inexhaustible fount of wealth. The ambition of the people of South Sudan is to be able to transform their country into a regional agro-industrial powerhouse  but without a helping hand from others the attainment of this goal will indeed remain a tall order. Much as we need external assistance  it is our passionate wish that it be offered on terms that will also respect our political and economic choices.  The Republic of South Sudan is under no illusion that economic development and prosperity can be achieved in the absence of a climate of peace and stability. We shall therefore strive to promote peace and harmony not only internally but also between all of our neighbours and us. Inside South Sudan  we have set up broad-based executive and legislative organs of Government that are inclusive of key political parties. We did so despite the fact that our party  the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement  won a landslide in the recent elections.   We were not deterred from installing such an accommodative Government by the fact that we do not even yet have in place the requisite legal framework governing political party activity. We took those steps not only because of our commitment to political pluralism  but primarily because of our strong conviction that measures of inclusion such as these can foster peace and harmony.  In the external domain  we remain strongly committed to maintaining peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with all States  and particularly with our neighbours. In that regard  I wish to affirm that the Republic of South Sudan fully adheres to the principle of absolute respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  including the Republic of the Sudan. Therefore  the Republic of South Sudan hereby categorically restates that it has not interfered and will not interfere in any domestic conflict situation in the Republic of the Sudan.  However  on account of the fact that conflict areas in the Republic of the Sudan border our country and that any spillover effects from those could negatively impact our own security  we urge the Government of the Sudan to seek a peaceful resolution to those conflicts. We would like to emphasize in particular that the reinstatement by the Government of the Sudan of the recent Addis Ababa framework accord on the situation in Southern Kordofan State and political relations between the Government and the opposition could go a long way towards promoting the restoration of peace in the areas bordering South Sudan.  There are a number of outstanding issues that have carried over from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We hope to expeditiously resolve them so as to ensure the complete normalization of relations between the two States and the start of a new era of a positive and mutually beneficial relationship that will be predicated on the commonalities shared by the people of the two States. We therefore urge the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to consent to the speedy demarcation of the border between the two States  with the help of the international community. We hope that Khartoum will no longer object to such an arrangement  given that South Sudan is now a sovereign State.   We would also like to plead with the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to agree to the submission of our dispute over the ownership of a number of border areas to international arbitration. The Government of the Republic of South Sudan applauds the cooperation of the Government of the Republic of the Sudan in paving the way to the deployment of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei  and    11-51185 22  hopes that the two countries will reach agreement sooner rather than later on the resolution of the Abyei issue  in line with the relevant provisions of the CPA.  On the economic front  South Sudan wishes to declare that it is willing and ready to outline serious negotiations with Khartoum. That will be done with the aim of reaching mutually acceptable arrangements that will guarantee for the Republic of the Sudan a fair income from the use of Sudan’s oil export infrastructure.  In terms of governance  we have moved to rectify some of the defects in our system by strengthening the pillars of good governance. A number of key bills — notable among which is a public financial management bill — are now making their way steadily through the legislative process. The passage of such laws will help promote accountability and transparency and ultimately curb corruption and the unwarranted loss of public revenue.  In conclusion  the new Republic of South Sudan vows to become an active member of the global family of nations  making its contribution to fostering world peace and prosperity for the benefit of all humankind."
"159",6422,"STP",66,2011,"The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe joins other speakers at this global forum in congratulating the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His election is the acknowledgment by Member States of the more than 30 years’ experience that he and his country  Qatar  have given in service of promoting international peace and security  sustainable development and dynamic  multidimensional cooperation among developing countries  as well as in continuing the search for solutions to the challenges facing multilateral diplomacy today.  We also congratulate the President on the significance of the theme of this session  “The role of mediation in conflict resolution through peaceful means”  whose relevance and timeliness merit the attention of all of us here and can help ensure that the outcome of our collective discussions will support the United Nations in its effective guidance of global democratic governance and in implementing coherent and consistent mechanisms aimed at achieving lasting peace and a more secure world.  We further congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to the post of Secretary-General  and thank him for the effort and skill with which he has guided the Organization  whose challenges and responsibilities seem more pressing than ever in the current international context. We would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland  who carried out his duties with zeal and dedication during the past year.  The theme of this session of the Assembly gives us an opportunity to reflect deeply together on the impact of international mediation on the resolution of conflicts in various regions of our planet. We would like to bring to this reflection a discussion of the central role that the United Nations should play in mediating such conflicts. This exercise should help us formulate concrete proposals for strengthening the capabilities of our Organization in this area.  Mediation as a method of resolving conflicts between States began to be used in 1907 in the form of good offices and mediation on the basis of The Hague Convention for the peaceful regulation of international conflicts. United Nations reports on peacekeeping operations should therefore remind us that the restoration of peace focuses on ongoing conflicts and strives to de-escalate them through diplomacy and mediation. The widespread use of international mediation to resolve crises as a fundamental technique of peaceful conflict resolution has not always matched our expectations or produced the expected results.  It is for that reason that Sao Tome and Principe believes that rather than settling for its role in peacekeeping  international mediation must evolve to become a fundamental factor in peacebuilding. In that regard  the United Nations should be responsible for dealing with what appears today to be a trend towards the professionalization of international mediation  which relegates to the background the legal instruments ratified by specialized institutions to deal with a given conflict. Defining the legal status of the mediator and the methodology of mediation  as well as greater involvement by diplomats and experts with experience in international law  seems to us to be necessary and important steps that the United Nations should take in the future.  The State of Sao Tome and Principe has followed with concern the growing international climate of tension  characterized by proliferating claims in various regions  some of them violent and destructive. Our concern is all the more worrisome given our distinct feeling that in such circumstances the mechanisms available to the United Nations for dealing with such matters effectively and accurately are pushed into the background. We regret the absence of a responsible partnership between the African Union and the Security Council designed to resolve the crisis in Libya.  It is therefore urgent that we strengthen the role of the United Nations by reforming the entire system — a process that should not drag on. This    11-51390 22  reform should include the Security Council and some of the specialized agencies of the United Nations  aligning them with the aspirations and demands of the modern world.  On 9 July  Africa saw the birth of one more free and independent nation: the Republic of South Sudan. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  which has already recognized the brotherly State of South Sudan  congratulates its people on this achievement and wishes its leaders every success in building a peaceful and prosperous nation. Similarly  we appeal to the entire international community to make a joint effort to support the new authorities and political actors of that country in order to maintain the national sovereignty of the new State and to promote a climate of national unity and political stability.  East Africa is facing a serious food crisis caused by phenomena that are beyond the control of men and by the political and military conflict still raging in parts of Somalia. It is incumbent upon us all to contribute without delay to finding a lasting solution to this serious situation. The Government of Sao Tome and Principe proclaims its readiness to participate in activities contributing to the alleviation of the suffering of the people of that region. We join other Members of the United Nations in appealing to the international community to provide more financial resources to support efforts to normalize the situation in the region. In the particular case of Somalia  we would appeal for an increase in official development assistance.  The United Nations is still addressing the pending question of the Western Sahara and has adopted several resolutions aimed at settling the conflict between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario. Sao Tome and Principe would like to see the two parties sit at the negotiating table and urges the United Nations to proceed with the population census  in accordance with its own resolutions  with a view to completing this long process of negotiation.  Democracy has the virtue of giving a voice to people so they can choose their leaders through popular  free  direct and transparent elections by secret ballots cast in voting booths. The uprisings that started in January in North Africa have expressed the sentiments and will of the people of Tunisia  Egypt and Libya to turn the page of their contemporary history. It is in this conviction that the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe recognizes the new governing authorities in these countries as legitimate representatives of their peoples.   We welcome the presence of the National Transitional Council within the United Nations  and urge the authorities of that country to conduct an inclusive process of peaceful transition to ensure peace  stability and social progress in that part of Africa. Furthermore  our country is of the view that political changes should take place not under violent circumstances  but without any pressure or political interference.  The Middle East continues to be shaken by an unprecedented wave of conflicts within the borders of some Middle Eastern countries as well as in the broader region. The people of Syria  Yemen and Bahrain have demanded reforms in State institutions. However  we see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continue. We reaffirm our support for the Palestinian people’s right to guide their destiny  and we advocate  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  for the existence of a Jewish State. We take this opportunity to appeal to the Government of the United States of America and the European Union to exert their influence to persuade the Government of the State of Israel to stop building settlements in the occupied territories.  The trade embargo imposed on Cuba decades ago is a major concern for our countries  and for Sao Tome and Principe in particular. We urge the lifting of the sanctions so that Cuba can participate on equal footing with other States in the process of building an international society that is more balanced and fair.  Global security is vital to the sustainable development of our countries. The threats emerging in the world today — particularly transnational crime  piracy  trafficking and the sale of weapons and drugs — are a real source of concern for Sao Tome and Principe  a country with extensive sea borders in the Gulf of Guinea. These phenomena are threats that cannot be ignored and require greater interaction with the Member States with which we share these extensive maritime borders. They also require our commitment to conflict prevention  management and resolution mechanisms  based on efforts to fight organized crime and with a view to ensuring our collective security.  In this connection  we highlight the fact that the 32nd meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa    23 11-51390  organized by the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs through its Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa in Lomé  was held in Sao Tome and Principe in March.  On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his timely and correct decision to give Africa its own central Office  which we believe will contribute greatly to the promotion and development of actions to prevent  manage and resolve conflicts in the region and will assist countries of the region in coping with possible threats to their sovereignty.  The profound changes wrought in the international political scene  resulting from structural changes in the world economy  pose new challenges to countries like Sao Tome and Principe. My country  a micro-island State  advocates greater access to the various opportunities available at the international level  in particular the possibility of obtaining more official development assistance and facilities to attract foreign investment.  It is our collective responsibility to take measures to address the harmful effects of climate change and ensure the continuity of the clean development mechanism  particularly for the least developed countries. We appreciate the political willingness of Member States to further pursue the building of the necessary consensus to achieve significant and legally binding results in Durban  South Africa  at the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  thus guaranteeing the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  However  climate change has caused imbalances in the microclimate of our country  with drastic consequences for our domestic production  thereby threatening the food security in Sao Tome and Principe. From this perspective  and in order to combat this scourge  civil society in Sao Tome has been advocating the need to enhance the study of the causes and adverse effects of climate change in Sao Tome and Principe. To fulfil this goal  the authorities of my country would like to continue to rely on the invaluable collaboration and availability expressed thus far by the international community in general and the specialized entities of the United Nations in particular.  I cannot end this speech without addressing the situation of the two straits.   Taking into account that has Taiwan not only enormous potential  but also a population of around 23 million people  its participation in United Nations specialized agencies  as has been the case since 2009 with respect to the World Health Assembly  could make a substantial contribution to the international community. In this regard  we urge the relevant United Nations bodies to seek ways and means to ensure the participation of Taiwan in some of the mechanisms and agencies of the United Nations system  in particular the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has just concluded the consolidation of its democratic process and transition of power through an election by universal suffrage  which was direct and anonymous. The President-elect took office on 3 September. Domestically  our Government is working to reduce poverty and promote economic growth and institutional reform  particularly in the area of justice  in order to strengthen the capacities of the country’s democratic institutions and development.  With regard to the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has made significant progress  particularly in the areas of education and health. We recognize  however  that greater efforts should be made to attain the desired objectives. In that regard  our State wishes to continue to benefit from the continued and multifaceted support of the international community.  To conclude  I would like to reiterate the readiness of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to participate in efforts to mobilize our collective will and our synergies in pursuit of the noble principles and objectives that underpin the creation of the United Nations."
"160",6463,"SUR",66,2011,"Allow me to join previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We welcome his efforts to promote the goals of the United Nations and to act as a bridge between the developed and the developing world. We pledge our full support and cooperation as he steers the work of this session.  I would also like to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for having guided us with much efficiency through the proceedings of the past session. We wish him well in his future endeavours. To Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has been elected once again at the helm of our Organization  we continue to extend our support and cooperation.  We welcome our newest Member State  the Republic of South Sudan  to the family of nations.  The United Nations was founded on the fundamental belief that collective action can serve our collective security. That steadfast principle is even more essential in addressing the many challenges that threaten world peace today. In Ambassador Al-Nasser’s inaugural statement as President  he referred to the enormous political  social  economic and environmental challenges facing the world (see A/65/PV.103).   I could not agree with him more. Pandemics such as AIDS  malaria and non-communicable diseases; threats related to terrorism  weapons of mass destruction  human trafficking  the illicit trade in and use of small arms and light weapons and the illicit drug trade; and the risks posed by climate change and the continuing vulnerability of our women and youth all call upon us to deepen our cooperation and strengthen our international institutions.  Although some citizens in developing countries enjoy good living standards  the realization of sustainable development in many of those countries    11-50871 20  remains unattainable. Achieving social justice for all represents the most basic humanitarian challenge of our times. In order to move the world further along the path of compassion  solidarity and shared responsibility  that goal deserves our highest attention.  As the world becomes more intertwined  the impact of climate change in one country or region is affecting the prosperity and security of others as well. As responsible citizens of this precious planet  we must stand united behind the collective goal to preserve our world for current and future generations. Our understanding of climate change suggests that our planet will undergo considerable changes over the next 50 years  impacting all areas of society.  For Suriname  with its low-lying coastline  that means a vulnerable exposure to a rising sea level  risking inundation of our fertile soil and freshwater reservoirs. With 80 per cent of Suriname’s population living in the coastal area  our ability to produce food and guarantee food security will be in serious jeopardy. For countries such as ours  it is therefore of paramount importance that the international community honour its commitments  realize the speedy implementation of the Cancún Agreements and honour its pledges to the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund.  We cannot afford for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban to fail to produce concrete agreements and targets on reducing emissions  which would lead to a halt or drastically reduce the rising temperature on the planet. We owe that to our present and we owe that to our future generations. We call upon all parties concerned to reach an agreement.  Suriname now stands at a crossroads in its efforts to attain sustainable development. We resolve to promote an investment-friendly environment  with prudent fiscal and monetary policies that are aimed at securing macroeconomic stability in the medium and long terms. Allow me to outline the main objectives of our development strategy. We intend to maintain real economic growth and raise per capita income  while simultaneously promoting a more equitable income distribution. We will further develop the mining sector as the engine of economic growth in the short and medium terms. We plan to move away from a commodity-based economy and focus on the diversification of our economy and increased investment in other sectors  such as the agro-industry  tourism  services  transport  infrastructure and housing. We will invest in our human capital  which is our most important resource. In that context  Suriname will strengthen its national capacities to enhance our the utilization of our abundant natural resources for the benefit of its people.  We are well aware that we cannot move forward in isolation. We recognize the strategic interest of international cooperation to complement national development policies. In that process  we are strongly committed to the objectives of such regional organizations as the Caribbean Community and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).  Despite the current international financial crisis — which is not of our making — Suriname’s present economic outlook remains favourable. Improper management of the world crisis  however  will have negative consequences on our economy. We are pleased with the UNASUR proposal for a complete restructuring of the international financial system  with the participation of all nations in the decision-making process. The time has come to bring an end to the practice of decision-making by only a few  which has had disastrous consequences for the majority of the peoples of the world. For countries such as Suriname  with small  open economies  it remains of vital importance to continue on the path of prudent macroeconomic policies and economic diversification.  Since it is understood that sustainable development can be attained only in a safe environment  it is crucial to preserve international peace and security. Armed conflicts  interference in the domestic affairs of States  terrorism and transnational crime — including drug-related crime and the illegal traffic in and use of small arms and light weapons — only derail our efforts to address the challenges that we are faced with today.  At the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  we are once again called on to reflect on the spirit of our Charter as it relates to the assurance of international peace  security and development. The theme for this session  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is most fitting  since mediation can and should become one of the most effective instruments in international conflict resolution. The failure to recognize and apply the principles of equity and justice in international   21 11-50871  relations has resulted in unacceptable situations. Those have brought about extreme poverty  further marginalization  increasingly brutal forms of criminality and destruction of the environment.  At the same time  we increasingly witness acts of war and intervention in many parts of the world. Such armed conflicts are sometimes preceded by a mandate of our very own Security Council  with disregard for the consequences of destruction  loss of life and human suffering. Suriname wishes to draw urgent attention to the stipulations of Article 33 in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter  which in our opinion have not been consistently applied. That failure has resulted in an unnecessary continuation of violence on the African continent.  I also express concern regarding the situation in Somalia  where severe famine has taken the lives of tens of thousands and continues to be a threat to thousands more. We must ask ourselves if the architects of the acts of war on that same continent — under the pretext of the protection of human rights — could not better have used those precious resources in the fight against famine. Furthermore  the Security Council should be a forum for dialogue and action  fully responsive to current and future global challenges  and should not be permitted to bypass the efforts of regional institutions that aim to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. In particular  when outbursts of violence occur  peaceful efforts should never be hindered or neglected.  On a special note  it is of great concern that approximately 18 months after the disastrous earthquake in Haiti  the recovery efforts on that island nation are stagnating. We therefore call upon the international community to honour its pledges and continue to support the efforts of the Haitian people to reconstruct their homeland.  Suriname reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to an independent State of Palestine  as endorsed by the General Assembly in December 2010 (see resolution 65/202). Suriname has responded to the plight of the Palestinian people and has taken the decision to recognize Palestine as a sovereign State  worthy of becoming a full-fledged Member of this world Organization.  We also reiterate our concern about the persistence of the imposition of the economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Those measures continue to cause hardship for the Cuban people and to have adverse effects on the just development of that country. How many more resolutions need to be adopted before justice can be done for the people of Cuba? Suriname once more calls on the States Members of the United Nations to vehemently reject the unilaterally imposed embargo on this nation.  In closing  the provisions and the spirit enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations remain valid as an instrument for promoting international peace  security and development.  As Members  we have the moral obligation to continue to live up to the provisions of our Charter  taking into consideration the demands of changing times in a changing world.  We must  however  ensure that unity and justice reign among all nations. "
"161",6487,"SVK",66,2011,"It is a distinct honour and pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at the outset of its sixty-sixth session. This forum provides us with an unparalleled opportunity to strengthen  through dialogue  our concerted efforts in the quest for solutions to the mounting challenges that the international community faces today. We  the leaders of the United Nations  are expected to offer guidance and find solutions.  I am convinced that  given the extensive diplomatic experience of the President of the Assembly  and under his able leadership  we will be able to make this session a successful one. I wish him every success in his demanding duties and assure him of my delegation’s full support and assistance. I also wish to express my delegation’s appreciation and gratitude for the exquisite work of his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  who so skilfully guided our proceedings during the sixty-fifth session.  Let me also join others in paying tribute to the remarkable work of the newly reappointed Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. We deeply value his eminent personal and diplomatic qualities and look forward to working with him during his next tenure.  Slovakia warmly welcomes the Republic of South Sudan as a new member of the United Nations family. We wish South Sudan every success and  above all  peace  security and prosperity for its people.  Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff  President of the Federative Republic of Brazil  opened her speech with these words:    “For the very first time in the history of the United Nations  a female voice is opening the general debate. It is the voice of democracy and equality.” ()  President Rousseff expressed in two words the main challenge for the coming years: courage and sincerity. This challenge is accurate at a time of economic and debt crisis. We have to say openly that we still do not have adequate solutions. We are facing common risks in economy  governance and politics.  Citizens all over the world expect leadership and a mutual synergy of economy and politics. The majority of the world’s population expects economic growth  prosperity and a better quality of life. Those living in poverty — the millions of people without jobs  without water and without food — expect real answers  quick action and results from political leaders.  What can such a small country as Slovakia do to address these challenges? First  it has to do its own homework in stabilizing the economy. That means ensuring our pension system’s sustainability through deep reforms  and enacting a fiscal responsibility law that will ensure that fiscal policy is responsible to future generations and counter-cyclical. It means labour market reforms that support the creation of the new jobs the country badly needs  especially for some of its vulnerable groups. It means lowering the administrative burden and decreasing barriers to entrepreneurship  improving the predictability of the legal environment  and ensuring a wider use of e-Government services. Of course  it means measures to tackle corruption and to increase transparency  for example through a legal act ensuring that any contract concerning the use of public funds is valid only if published on the internet.    11-51360 8   The Slovak Republic is a small country  but it is a part of the eurozone  which is in deep economic trouble. Courage and sincerity are most needed most these days in Europe. The financial crisis and its negative influence upon the entire European banking sector have clearly shown that the eurozone was not prepared for a crisis. The chaos in addressing these issues only deepened the general distrust and worsened the subsequent economic recession. The majority of European Union countries did not use the good economic times to consolidate their budgets. Therefore  in many cases  the consequences of the recession shifted public debt into dangerous territory.  We need courage in the eurozone to return to the old principles that established the European Union  which are necessary for successful international cooperation and integration. We need stricter European and national fiscal rules. We need to institute default controls  and we need new rules for the careful management of the financial sector.  We need sincerity. We have to be honest with our citizens  because we have to be very careful that the response to forcing technical solutions to the debt crisis is not the escalation of nationalism and populism. There is a chance that we will save the eurozone economically  but at the same time we must minimize the risk of losing the project of European integration politically and devaluing it in the eyes of our voters.  It is not just Europe; every region in the world is struggling today with serious economic difficulties. We live in a global  interdependent reality in which we cannot afford to ignore anybody’s problems. In this regard  we believe that  as a member of the Economic and Social Council  that body has the capacity to contribute more significantly to our joint efforts. If it is to do that  we feel that it is urgent to adjust its mandate and enhance its ability to react more swiftly to the economic and social needs of the world.  In times of dire financial restrictions in our own national budgets  we  as the United Nations  also need to learn to do more with fewer resources. We welcome every effort that the Secretary-General is making to utilize the available resources with maximum effectiveness and efficiency.  Peace and security are ever harder to maintain in these harsh crisis times. One of Slovakia’s priorities in the fight against international terrorism remains the endeavour to move forward the negotiations on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism. With regard to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  Slovakia will continue its implementation through concrete projects  as we have by co-organizing a special event on implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia  held in Bratislava in December 2010. Respect for international law  human rights and the rule of law should be an integral part of the fight against international terrorism.  Peacekeeping missions are among the most visible and successful activities of the United Nations and the true expression of the commitment to maintaining peace and security around the globe. The Slovak Republic has been an active contributor to the United Nations forces in Cyprus since 2001  and is involved in the Middle East. In recent decades  we have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of United Nations peacekeeping missions. They have become increasingly in-demand  their mandates are widening and their management is becoming more complex. Slovakia therefore supports every measure aimed at increasing their effectiveness and efficiency given our truly constrained budgets.  Peace is not merely the absence of war. Peace means safety in all areas of people’s lives  economic prosperity  social stability  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  access to health care and education  protection of the environment  and access to water and food. There is no chance of lasting peace without sustainable development. That is an area in which we must still do a great deal of work and make concerted efforts. Aid from Slovakia — a small country — has since 2003 been aimed at the most troubled regions of the world. Recently  Slovakia has been providing development and humanitarian aid in the context of 41 projects to help starving children in Kenya  deliver food and water in Ethiopia; provide humanitarian help in South Sudan; assist Pakistan following the terrible floods there; help refugees  from Libya to Tunisia; and also to provide technical assistance for countries in the western Balkans and in the Middle East. Slovakia is also helping to secure the democratization process in Afghanistan through 13 new projects.  We need to focus on eliminating the primary causes of conflicts  not just deal hastily with their grave consequences  which  sadly  often occur only after too many lives have been destroyed. No effort   9 11-51360  should be spared in exploring all political and diplomatic options to stop conflicts at their roots. Mediation has proved to yield tangible results. I want to stress the important role of women in these processes  as it is often underestimated.   Slovakia is a firm supporter of effective multilateralism  with the United Nations playing a central role. Concentrated efforts help create just and lasting solutions.  This will be yet another challenging session for all of us. It calls for a renewed  shared commitment to the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We cannot afford to lose the ability to understand one another’s needs because of our own domestic problems. In these hard times  I wish all of us enough strength to find necessary  mutually advantageous solutions."
"162",6512,"SVN",66,2011,"I start by congratulating Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of the General Assembly at its current session  on his election  and express our belief that with his wisdom and experience he will guide the Assembly well.  I also express our sincere gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his important contribution to the work of the General Assembly and the United Nations.  Obviously  I wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and to thank him for the vision and dedication with which he works for    11-50847 16  the United Nations and for his tireless efforts to promote the spirit of the Charter. We deeply appreciate his leadership and wish him continued success in his second term in office as he guides the United Nations in these challenging times.  Slovenia welcomes the President’s decision to put the theme of mediation at the centre of our deliberations at this session. Indeed  no other theme seems more timely at this moment of search for an approach towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The European Union  to which Slovenia belongs  is currently fully engaged with high-profile mediation in this context. The mediation under way has two aims.  The first is the revival of the peace process with a view to finding an early solution — a genuine and fair peace agreement involving two States  Israel and Palestine  which would live side by side in peace and security. Secondly  an immediate task relevant to the United Nations is to find an adequate status for Palestine within the ranks of our common  global Organization. Those two aims are genuinely linked  and the latter should be understood as supporting the former.  Our common Organization  the United Nations  is committed to its inclusive character and the universality of its membership. This is the spirit in which we see some of the significant developments of this year.   We welcome the Republic of South Sudan as the newest Member of the United Nations. Our Organization should render every assistance to the new Member in its efforts to establish its structures and to serve the wellbeing of its people.  We also welcome the decision of the General Assembly to grant the seat of Libya to the representatives of the National Transitional Council of Libya. This has established a much needed link between the United Nations and the people of Libya in their effort to build legitimate  democratic and effective institutions and to pursue the path of economic  social and political development  in accordance with the wishes of the people.   Yesterday  at a special High-level Meeting we discussed the forms of assistance in some detail. Today we can say that there is a fair chance of success for effective cooperation between the people of Libya and the United Nations as well as the regional organizations — in particular  the African Union and the Arab League. Together we shall be better able to assist. Slovenia is willing to continue to do its part in this framework.  Political and security concerns are always an important priority for the United Nations. But they have to be considered against the background of other priorities  both long-term and short-term. The Organization has developed its engagements in the most important and the most difficult issues of environment and sustainable development. We need to take resolute steps towards a new and effective system to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure the necessary adaptation.   We hope that the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Durban later this year  will bring us a step closer to final agreement. The negative impacts of climate change are disproportionate. We should pay particular attention to the unique challenges faced by the small island developing States  whose characteristics make them among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change.  The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  to be held next year  will be an opportunity to secure renewed political commitment to sustainable development  to assess the progress of implementation of agreed commitments  and to address new and emerging challenges. We should strengthen our efforts to develop a new concept of development that will capture economic growth  social development and environmental protection. It is our duty to make a difference  and making a difference requires a more comprehensive definition of development.  Maintaining our focus on the successful implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  we should pay particular attention to the special needs of Africa  especially those countries most in need. The Istanbul Programme of Action offers concrete solutions for improving progress in the least developed countries.  In times of economic crisis in the donor countries  which seems to continue unabated  increasing aid proves difficult to attain. Improving aid effectiveness is crucial.    17 11-50847   There can be no gain in the field of development if other policies  such as trade  agriculture  migration  climate change and so on  cancel out the positive effects of development policies. In this regard  let me convey our hopes for the successful deliberations of the High-level Forum to be held in Busan later this year.  Recent experience in the exercise of development activities has strengthened understanding of the links between development and human rights. The concept of the right to development is gaining in substance and recognition. Moreover  specific development tasks have provided further evidence of the importance of this link. The role of women in development is a pertinent example. Experience and research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  for example  have shown that empowerment of women in agriculture can reduce hunger by 30 per cent — a very impressive result by any measure.   Gender equality and the empowerment of women are essential to promoting peace  security and above all development. Slovenia strongly supports the work of UN-Women  which will help to significantly boost United Nations efforts to promote gender equality  expand opportunities and tackle discrimination against women around the globe.  Another priority in the field of human rights that Slovenia values highly relates to the rights of the child and to human rights education. This year  as President of the Executive Board of UNICEF  Slovenia worked tirelessly to attain universal ratification of both optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The objective should be to ensure  through United Nations instruments and national action  effective protection of the rights of the child and to improve the wellbeing of children in all parts of the world.  An important segment of this work relates to human rights education  which helps to empower young people in their efforts to secure their rightful place in society. I remember when Slovenia and Costa Rica launched a human rights education campaign in the Third Committee almost 20 years ago. It is gratifying to see that today human rights are increasingly being included in official school curriculums. But there is still much more that we need to do to incorporate human rights learning into societies as a lifelong process. The United Nations  its Human Rights Council and the General Assembly will  I am convinced  continue to make a significant contribution.   I would like to express satisfaction over the adoption of the draft declaration on human rights education and training by the Human Rights Council during its March session this year. I call on all States to support this important declaration  which I am convinced the General Assembly will adopt — hopefully  unanimously — later this autumn.  Human rights concerns are most tragic in the case of humanitarian disasters. The current famine in the Horn of Africa is a sad example. It is a crisis of human existence and human rights. All actors of the international community  including my country  Slovenia  are already trying to help. But more help is needed; humanitarian assistance must expand.  I have briefly referred to some of Slovenia’s areas of particular importance  particular engagement and particular activity. Our commitment to the United Nations is strong and will remain strong.   The United Nations is an Organization of all and for all. For almost 20 years now Slovenia has been working as a devoted Member State. We have made proposals for specific action and enjoyed working with all other Member States — large and small  geographically close and geographically distant. We have worked together on specific proposals and decisions and on implementation.  We have also proposed a set of ideas for reform of the Security Council. We hope that the coming year will see more resolute steps in that regard  and that more progress will be made than there has been so far.  The United Nations is an important hope — a hope for the world — and an opportunity for its Member States to bring the reality  complicated and onerous as it may be  closer to our hopes. It is in this spirit that Slovenia has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. We hope for broad support.   If we are elected we shall be a faithful United Nations Member State  aware of the responsibilities of the Security Council and all its members towards the entire Organization and all Member States. We pledge our efforts  our judgement and our sense of fairness as a contribution to the United Nations. And fairness is a    11-50847 18  commodity  a principle  a value  that the international community needs most of all."
"163",6557,"SWE",66,2011,"More than 10 years ago  we decided to set eight concrete goals to free humankind from extreme poverty  from hunger and disease  and from illiteracy. We called them the Millennium Development Goals. These Goals have been powerful. They have helped the international community to monitor and mobilize resources for development cooperation.  And important progress has been made. We have seen poverty decline in many countries. By 2015  the global poverty rate is expected to fall below 15 per cent. We have seen some of the poorest countries make the greatest strides in education. Child mortality has been reduced. New HIV infections are declining steadily. Access to clean drinking water has increased. But we still have a long way to go in other areas in order to raise standards of living and offer equal opportunities to people around the globe.  Today I would like to focus on one key area where progress is still very slow. But since it affects half of the world’s population and half its human resources  it is of crucial importance. I am referring to maybe the most important human rights failure of all  or at least the one that affects the largest number of human beings. I am referring to the unmet human  economic and social rights of 3.5 billion women and girls. They make up half of the world  but they are not allowed to fulfil their potential as powerful drivers of economic development as well as of peace and security.  Let me just fill members in on the situation we have today. Women perform 66 per cent of the world’s work and produce 50 per cent of its food  but they earn only 10 per cent of its income and own one per cent of its property. Seventy per cent of the world’s poor population are women or girls. Every day  approximately 1 000 women die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. That adds up to about 350 000 deaths each year.  This week we witnessed a historic step in the history of the United Nations  when Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff became the first woman ever to open the general debate. At the same time — standing here  mid-2011 — there are still countries that do not allow women to vote. And only in 28 countries has women’s parliamentary representation reached a critical mass of 30 per cent or more. Only 19 women lead their countries as elected Heads of State or Government. This is not fair. It is not just. And  frankly  it makes no sense.  To me  gender equality is first and foremost a question of ensuring equal rights for women and men. It is about giving all individuals  irrespective of gender     11-51185 42  the same possibilities of education  economic opportunity and participating in society. In 2011  there are women who still do not enjoy equal rights. They are refused the rights to vote  to inherit  to work and even to drive a car. And at the far end of the spectrum  women are subject to gender-based violence and rape as a weapon of war.   But gaps in these rights are not only a loss for the women affected; they are a loss to society as a whole and  I must say  very bad economic policy for the countries concerned. Not least in these times of global economic crisis  it seems obvious that we should realize the full potential of all human resources.  I will give a few examples. Closing the gap between male and female employment rates would have huge implications for the global economy. It would boost the United States gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 9 per cent  the eurozone GDP by 13 per cent and Japanese GDP by as much as 16 per cent. But increased gender equality does not merely have immediate economic benefits; it is also an investment for the future. The evidence from a range of countries is clear. When women take greater control of household income  more money is spent on children’s needs  such as food  health and education. Children grow taller  are ill less often and are likely to get better jobs. Moreover  when women play a greater part in society by shaping institutions or taking leading roles in politics or business life  there are clear improvements for the public good  and corruption is lessened. When they are present at the building of peace  results improve.  In short  I see gender equality not only as a crucial human rights issue  but also as a question of smart economics. I would urge all representatives sitting in this Hall today to imagine what it would mean in terms of economic growth for their countries if women were allowed to participate fully in society.  As technology develops  the world is changing. In one minute I can use my mobile phone to get hold of a friend on the other side of the globe or my children back home in Sweden. That is  of course  amazing. But in one minute  we can also get a first-hand report on the situation in troubled parts of the world. We can get first-hand access to pictures of abuse and violence  taken by hidden mobile phones and for the whole world to see. Today  ideas of freedom and democracy are spreading at the speed of sound. We have seen it in North Africa. We are seeing it in the Middle East. The Internet and new technology have laid out a high-speed motorway heading towards democracy and freedom. We can see that some are trying to put out roadblocks; repressive Governments try to quash the rights they fear.  The United Nations must play a leading role in embracing and maintaining those new roads to democracy and freedom. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression recently concluded that there must be as little restriction as possible of online freedom of expression. He called it an enabler of other human rights. Sweden  together with 40 other nations around the world  strongly supports his conclusion. We want to build an alliance for the freedom of the Internet  and we have launched a special initiative for democratization and freedom of expression so that we can urgently support human rights activists and agents of democratic change. The Internet is the new front line in the fight for freedom across the world.  In many countries  my own included  we take freedom for granted. In other countries  it is still a dream. This year  we have witnessed courageous people in North Africa and the Middle East taking to the streets to fight for their dream; to fight for freedom  openness and democracy. For this  they must have our support. When there are threats of genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity — when autocratic rulers  as in Syria  turn their guns on their own citizens — then the international community has a responsibility to protect civilians.  Sweden hopes to play its part in this decisive phase in the region. We are contributing to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) in Libya. We are providing substantial humanitarian support to several countries in North Africa and the Middle East. And when the new Governments turn to the crucial task of establishing democratic principles  the rule of law and respect for human rights  we will be ready to continue our support and do more to see the Arab Spring turn into a blossoming summer.  The European Union is firmly committed to Israel and a Palestinian State living side by side with each other in peace and security. We all want to see the peace process resume. Violations of international law   43 11-51185  must cease. Only then can a true and lasting peace be achieved.  The Horn of Africa is suffering its worst famine in 60 years. We are faced with a huge humanitarian disaster. The international community must respond faster and better  now. Disasters such as those in Haiti  Pakistan and now in the Horn of Africa show the central importance of the United Nations in humanitarian action. The United Nations needs our full support to further improve the international response capacity.  In a globalized world  we are not just interconnected online; together we share a planet with finite resources. And yet we consume as if there was no tomorrow. I believe that sustainable development requires global solutions. In this respect  the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held next year in Brazil will be very important. I am really hoping for a strong renewed political commitment to sustainable development.  We are also looking for concrete progress at the Durban Climate Change Conference in November. We know what we need and we have known it for some time — further reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not achieve that  we are simply not going to be able to reverse the trend of global warming.  These are turbulent times. Some countries are suffering from financial and economic crises; others are suffering from the severe consequences of global warming; yet others are building new societies as freedom and democracy have replaced dictatorships and repression. More than ever  there is a need for a well-functioning global arena for international cooperation and conflict resolution and for the pursuit of sustainable economic  social and environmental development. The need for a strong United Nations    based on political legitimacy  justice and human rights  is as strong as ever. Sweden will do its utmost to support a strong United Nations through substantial contributions to humanitarian and development assistance and to its work for peace  security and human rights.  We also want to help revitalize the work of the United Nations on disarmament and non-proliferation. Together with Mexico we will  as co-Chairs of the seventh Conference Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  work hard on advancing the Treaty’s entry into force.   We have also presented our candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period 2013-2015. As a member of the Council  Sweden would contribute actively to making it a more efficient and active body and to promoting the universal enjoyment of human rights — making rights real.  This week we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the Swedish Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. He played an important role in reforming and shaping the United Nations as we know it today. Let me conclude with these words from Dag Hammarskjöld:   “The pursuit of peace and progress  with its trials and its errors  its successes and its setbacks  can never be relaxed and never abandoned”.  That was true then and it is true today."
"164",6595,"SWZ",66,2011,"It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of His Majesty   7 11-51197  King Mswati III  Head of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland. His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Queen Mother  the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland send best wishes and congratulations to the State of Qatar and Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident that his wide experience and diplomatic skills will ensure success in the challenging issues that face this session. I should also like to commend the excellent work of his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss.  The founders of the United Nations envisaged an international Organization whose primary strength would rest in its Members acting collectively and cooperatively in resolving international problems. In this regard  the theme of this general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  pertinently captures the initial vision.   The pursuit of peace and security in many parts of the world is vital to a future of continued coexistence. We owe it to posterity to maintain a habitable world. International efforts to intervene and mediate in internal conflicts should not be taken lightly and interlocutors should be alert to the sensibilities involved in every specific situation. History has taught us that transplanted solutions never work successfully. There is no one-size-fits-all in the pursuit of peace because every situation and era is unique. The international community should also be quick to spot irrelevant forces that seek to champion narrow interests.  The Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on the independence it obtained this year and celebrated on 9 July. Credit must also go to the Republic of the Sudan for its steadfast resolve to see to it that the process was successful. The efforts of the High-Level Panel on Darfur and the Panel of the Wise commissioned by the African Union are also acknowledged. The African Union has been instrumental in utilizing the vast experience of former leaders of Africa as it seeks to identify African solutions for African problems. My country wishes to reiterate its commitment to this concept.   For a similar reason  the Kingdom of Swaziland prays with the people of Libya that there will be a swift end to the current conflict and a sustainable solution that has the quest of peaceful resolution as the watchword when dealing with any transitional difficulties. In this regard  we look forward to the formation of an all-inclusive Government that will ensure that Libya moves towards a brighter future. The world needs a unified and stable Libya to resume its place in global affairs.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the hugely damaging long-term effects of the war in Somalia. The difficulties are now compounded by a terrible famine. While the blame might be placed on climate change  nevertheless we hold the view that Somalia would manage this latest humanitarian disaster — the famine — considerably better if the international community were to collaborate on a sustainable political solution  which is essential for economic recovery. Sadly the world appears to have forgotten Somalia  with only the African Union and other regional arrangements dealing with the effects of the war in that country.   The piracy problem  which has clearly deepened  is one of many signs that Somalia needs a comprehensive political intervention that involves all international interlocutors. There has been a great deal of support for the fight against piracy  but not as part of a more holistic approach. The world surely does not want to send the message that its interventions take place only when specific interests are threatened.   In the same spirit  the Kingdom of Swaziland encourages the Quartet on the question of Palestine to remain resolute in finding common ground between Israel and Palestine. We are well aware that there have been setbacks before  but we are optimistic that at the end of it all there will be a groundbreaking solution  with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and harmony.  The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of the world in its condemnation of terrorism and threats to international peace and security. In the same spirit  we recall the 9/11 criminal attacks that occurred 10 years ago and all who were affected. We therefore commend the Secretary-General for hosting the Symposium on International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation  which underscored the importance of greater international cooperation among States on a whole range of counter-terrorism topics  as covered in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We hope that the recommendations thereof will provide a source of    11-51197 8  reference to all Member States  international organizations and relevant stakeholders.  The promotion and protection of human rights are a common objective of all countries. While great achievements have been made in international human rights cooperation since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  challenges still exist. As a developing country  we believe that greater importance should be attached to the right to development so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of globalization. The international community should pay more attention to economic  social and cultural rights — such as the right to life  the right to food and the right to health — and promote international cooperation in this regard. The developed countries should do more to honour their commitments in terms of development assistance  technology transfer  debt reduction and market access so as to create favourable conditions for the effective promotion of the universal realization of the right to development.   The Kingdom of Swaziland voted in favour of resolution 60/251  which established the Human Rights Council. We also formed part of the consensus on resolution 65/281 on the review of the Human Rights Council adopted this year. To this end  we also support the engagement of Member States in the Universal Periodic Review mechanism  which examines the human rights situation in all countries. Our country will be among those to be considered at the Universal Periodic Review in October 2011  and we look forward to engaging in an open and candid dialogue with other members of the Council.  Throughout the past session  we pursued many development topics  notably the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS in June at which our political will to intensify our efforts to eliminate the scourge was reaffirmed. The Kingdom of Swaziland is proud to have made great strides in this regard. For example  the percentage of children born HIV-free to HIV-positive mothers enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme has risen to 83 per cent and is expected to reach 100 per cent by 2015.   In today’s highly integrated and interconnected world  almost all issues demand the full participation of international partners. Taiwan is one of the leading economic and technological powerhouses of the world today  and the Kingdom of Swaziland is of the view that Taiwan can contribute successfully to the international community. We therefore urge the United Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized agencies and mechanisms  including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. There is no doubt that the there is a functional need to include the people of Taiwan in the United Nations system and that their inclusion would be in the common interest of the international community.  In conclusion  may I say that the Kingdom of Swaziland has confidence in the initiatives already taken towards the renewal of this Organization and looks forward to a new dynamic and vibrant working period.

"165",6670,"SYR",66,2011,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I wish him every success in his efforts to promote the interests of our international Organization. I also pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  and express to him our gratitude and appreciation for his successful presidency of the Assembly last year.  It is only natural that I should start by addressing the current situation in Syria  our position in that regard and the circumstances and events unfolding inside and outside of our country. There is no doubt that States’ positions and circumstances are governed by their geopolitical realities  related problems and demands stemming therefrom. At the same time  they are influenced by repercussions and the price they have to pay  whether high or low  resulting from positions they take in response to those issues.   The Syrian Arab Republic is located at the heart of the Middle East region. Syria’s location has determined its major role in the politics and balances of the Arab world and the region in general. For many decades  Syria faced major challenges and difficulties with a firm stance against attempts to limit its role and influence and divert it from the national course it had charted. It is no secret that Syria has stood firm in support of national sovereignty and independence in its national decisions — a position that has remained a primary pillar of Syrian foreign policy.  Syria has spared no effort in support of the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people and in championing resistance movements. Syria has upheld its inalienable right to liberate the entire occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. At the same time  Syria has extended a hand of friendship to all States and established its international relations based on mutual respect and mutual interests. Through leverage  it has promoted the centrepiece of Syria’s national priorities and established policies  namely on the Middle East question  in efforts to liberate the land and restore the rights of the people.  Syria was dragged into another confrontation following the occupation of Iraq. It had to choose between enduring political siege and isolation or submitting to demands. Again Syria summoned all of its might to overcome such a policy  despite the exorbitant price we had to pay at the expense of our domestic priorities and interests. We emerged stronger from that battle  having preserved our independent decisions and safeguarded our national priorities.  There are two sides to the problem that Syria faces today. On the one hand  the country needs people-driven political  economic and social reform. President Bashar Al-Assad has already declared that those reforms are needed and timely. He has expressed a strong desire to accomplish them. But the force of the political circumstances to which I briefly alluded to earlier forced internal demands — important as they were — to take a back seat to other priorities. Our   53 11-51384  overriding priority was to address external pressures that at times were tantamount to blatant conspiracy.  On the other hand  popular demands and needs have been manipulated to further objectives alien to the interests and expressed desires of the Syrian people. Those demands have become stepping stones used by armed groups to sow discord and to sabotage our security  eventually becoming a new pretext for foreign intervention.   Syria has assumed its responsibility to protect its citizens through actions to guarantee safety and stability. It remains vigilant against the danger of foreign intervention  which takes on different forms with each passing day. Challenging that does not diminish our concern for popular demands that were already accommodated prior to the recent events. In our view  the needed reforms are those that are now due  many elements of which have been already met. They are a work in progress that will continue through national dialogue and in the context of national unity  sovereignty and independence.  To shed more light on the situation  I would recall at this juncture the statement made by President Al-Assad on 20 June. In his statement  the President announced many reform measures based on the following new laws: the political parties act to guarantee political pluralism; the information act to lay the ground for free and independent media; the parliamentary elections act and the local administration act. The proposed reform measures were to be finalized by a thorough examination and review of the Syrian Constitution. The review could eliminate certain articles to allow for political pluralism and democratic practices. It could even lead to the framing of a new Constitution that would guarantee all of these things.   The constitution is the backbone of the political  economic and social life of all States. That reform measure will definitely respond to popular demands and needs. Furthermore  the President left the door open to different views and proposals on the reform effort in general. In the televised interview that followed  the President announced that a timeline had been set to agree on and implement the proposed reforms in no more than six months. That is an extremely important position that requires a serious  in-depth national dialogue in order to achieve the desired mechanisms and results.   A comprehensive dialogue started a few weeks ago in various Syrian governorates. Representatives of various sectors of Syrian society  including opposition figures  are participating in the process to examine the comprehensive political  economic and social components of the proposed reform package.  We deeply regret the surge in foreign-inspired activities of armed groups in Syria  which have not waned and have instead continued to gain momentum. That is the other side of the coin. We would have liked for those countries that advocated the need for reform and change to have supported the official Syrian position instead of having opted for incitement and defiance. In fact  the more ground we have covered towards stability and reform  the stronger the foreign incitement has become. Armed violence has surged in tandem with multiple economic sanctions. By targeting the Syrian economy with sanctions  the United States and the European Union have jeopardized the interests and basic daily subsistence needs of the Syrian people.   This course of action cannot in any way be reconciled with pronouncements about concern for the interests  security and rights of the Syrian people. Furthermore  it runs counter to the basic principles of human rights  in defence of which those States base their interference in our internal affairs. It must be recalled that the Charter of our Organization states that “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state”.   Syria provided our region with a model of peaceful coexistence among the different segments of the Syrian population  a model which deserves to be emulated. Syria opted for secularism to promote its national unity in view of the religious and ethnic diversity of the region to which it belongs  a region that is the cradle of divine religions and the birthplace of human civilization.  Any objective and realistic analysis of the events in and around Syria will demonstrate clearly that one of the purposes of the unjust anti-Syria campaign currently under way is to attack this model of coexistence  which has been a source of pride to our people. How can we otherwise explain media provocations of financing and arming religious extremism? What purpose could that serve other than total chaos  which would dismember Syria — and    11-51384 54  consequently adversely affect its neighbours? What else could this course of action achieve other than to spread Western hegemony throughout the countries of the Mediterranean and to serve Israel’s expansionist interests?  I assure the Assembly that our people are determined to reject all forms of foreign intervention in their internal affairs. We shall continue to achieve security and stability and to implement the comprehensive programme of reform through national dialogue so that  within months  Syria will become a model of political pluralism and an oasis for peaceful coexistence among the different segments of its population.  From this rostrum  I call on the States that have participated in the unjust campaign against Syria to reconsider their positions. To them I say  “Our people will not let you implement your plans and will foil your schemes”.  I also express our appreciation to the countries that have stood by our people’s side in this crisis  pre-empting any harm that could have befallen their interests and encouraging them to pursue their aspirations.  For many years  the international community has considered the two-State solution as the basis for establishing peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The negotiations between the two sides that have continued for years have failed to achieve any progress towards a solution owing to Israel’s well-known positions and measures. Therefore  the international community’s pursuit of the recognition of   a Palestinian State on the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  with Jerusalem as its capital  is legitimate. It is a positive step towards restoring all Palestinian rights. Syria calls on the international community to support that request. We also condemn the Israeli blockade of Gaza and call on the international community to shoulder its responsibility and force Israel to lift the blockade.   Our position on declaring the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone is well established and well known. We continue to call for bringing pressure to bear on Israel to implement international resolutions that have called on it to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to submit its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s comprehensive safeguards regime. This measure is of extreme importance to the security and stability of our region. At the same time  we stress that all States have the right to acquire nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. That right is guaranteed under the NPT.  We strongly renew the call to lift the embargo that has been enforced against Cuba for decades.  We all aspire to a more just and secure world. This international Organization has a major role to play in that regard. It can do so more competently if some powerful States gave up attempts to further their own agendas. Nevertheless  we still hope that the international community  through this Organization  will be able to follow the right course so as to bring about a better world  to which our peoples aspire."
"166",6715,"TCD",66,2011,"The Chadian delegation warmly congratulates the President on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and assures him of its cooperation and support as he carries out his noble endeavours.   I also express my delegation’s admiration for his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  who skilfully guided the Assembly’s work during the sixty-fifth session.  Finally  Chad pays tribute the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his work on the development front and towards peace in the world. We reiterate to him our warmest congratulations on his well-deserved re-election to a second term at the helm of our Organization.  My delegation welcomes the choice of the central theme for our general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes”. This theme is fully consistent with our own political vision  our convictions and our philosophy of a harmonious and egalitarian world.   Chad has made its own modest contribution in supporting the efforts of the State of Qatar  the United Nations and the international community by participating at the highest level in the negotiations and conclusion of the Doha Framework Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in Darfur between the Sudanese Government and the armed opposition in Darfur. We sincerely hope that this crisis will finally be resolved. To that end  the Sudan should be supported by the entire international community  so that peace and security can be restored throughout the country and in the subregion.   Furthermore  we are concerned by the hotbeds of tension that are spreading throughout the world and that sometimes stem from the profound changes taking place  particularly in some countries of the Middle East and in the Maghreb. That process is often described as the Arab Spring.  Our Organization must be resolute in its commitment to stand with the parties to conflict  as part of efforts to find solutions based on reconciliation and forgiveness. In addition to the losses of human life    11-50871 30  that we have witnessed  we should also mention the fact that dramatic circumstances such as these also result in the inevitable streams of refugees and the displaced. And when we speak of refugees and displaced persons  we are talking about misery and terrible suffering. We are well qualified to discuss this issue  given that Chad is now hosting more than 100 000 refugees from Central Africa in the south-western part of the country and more than 290 000 Sudanese refugees and 180 000 Chadian displaced persons in the east. They have been living in this situation since 2003  in precarious environmental and social conditions.  We call on the international community to show solidarity and to assist us in assuming responsibility for all Chadian displaced persons. In the wake of the full withdrawal last March of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT)  the Chadian Government assumed responsibility for the protection of refugees and displaced persons  as well as of the humanitarian organizations that are assisting them  by setting up a special national force known as the Détachement intégré de sécurité. It is to be hoped that our partners will continue to deploy efforts alongside us and complement them with the financial and logistical support necessary to the proper functioning of that force.  In addition  like a number of other Sahel countries  Chad has witnessed the return from Libya  in very dangerous conditions  of almost 100 000 of its nationals who were forced to leave Libya in a state of utter destitution. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the International Organization for Migration and other institutions as well as all those countries that have assisted us in repatriating and providing assistance to our nationals. Our deepest desire is for peace to return to Libya so that the killing can end and the Libyans can reconcile in the framework of the National Transitional Council in order to build a State based on the rule of law and democracy.  In connection with the building of a new Libya  we would draw the attention of our Libyan brothers to the situation of those of our citizens who  despite having contributed to the development of that country as immigrant workers  are sometimes referred to indiscriminately as mercenaries. In addition  we wish to express our great concern about the fate of the 400 000 Chadians who remain trapped in Libya. We call on the new Libyan authorities urgently to take measures aimed at fulfilling its commitment to protect immigrants.  Chad would also like to share with the Assembly our views on current issues of common concern  a number of which are being discussed in meetings during this session. These are mainly problems that affect international solidarity. They include the handling of economic and environmental crises as well as the security situation in our region. These issues directly affect our daily lives in that they hinder or even stall our development efforts  particularly in the case of countries emerging from conflict  such as Chad. The aftermath of those crises will certainly jeopardize the implementation of our development strategies and our capacity to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  Chad  which has lived through decades of external attacks  cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals unless it receives substantial support through  inter alia  the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. For that reason  we have repeatedly called for support from the relevant international institutions.   One of the consequences of climate change is that this year the Sahel area saw low levels of rainfall  which could lead to an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe such as the one that we have seen in recent months in the Horn of Africa.  We commend all of the initiatives undertaken by the Organization to promote international solidarity with our countries through high-level meetings and summits  including the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Istanbul  and upcoming conferences on combating desertification and on sustainable development  to be held in Korea and in Rio de Janeiro  respectively.  Among the other major initiatives that we have undertaken  I would like to stress in particular those relating to free emergency health care  maternal and child health  communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria  and free education at all levels. Our policies on gender and on the empowerment of youth remain the cornerstone of our vision of a new Chad that is moving ahead and making progress.  Finally  of all the challenges facing us  the issue of sustainable development remains a priority. Indeed    31 11-50871  following the holding in Chad in June 2010 of a meeting on the Great Green Wall initiative by the countries of the Sahel  our country in October 2010 convened the eighth World Forum on Sustainable Development on the theme “Save Lake Chad”. The action plans that emerged from those meetings are being publicized so as to ensure support for their implementation. We call once again on the international community to assist those countries located on the banks of Lake Chad to help save the lake  because the world should know that the future of the Congo Basin forest depends on its survival  as does the combat against desertification.   The question of Palestine has been outstanding for far too long  and its impact on regional and global security influence is felt daily. There is therefore an urgent need for an international consensus on the issue of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We believe that the time has come to recognize a State of Palestine living side by side with the State of Israel. We must have the courage to move forward in this direction  which is essential in order to bring about peace between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples. For that reason  I call on all peace- and justice-loving countries to commit themselves to that end.  Finally  we would like once again to touch on the issue of the reform of the United Nations  one of whose characteristics is the marginalization of a large part of humankind; I refer here to the African people. African States  individually and collectively  are today key players in terms of peace  security and development. Unfortunately  it has to be said that they have not yet assumed their full role within the system  because of  inter alia  their marginalization in the context of initiatives aimed at resolving certain conflicts that pose a threat to peace and security on our continent.  United Nations reform is absolutely necessary  and we should accelerate the process  in consideration of the claims and legitimate hopes of Africans  whose main concern is to fulfil the right of the African continent to be represented on the Security Council by a permanent seat with veto power. That is the only way for Africa to effectively contribute to conflict prevention and settlement and to the maintenance of peace in the world at large and on the African continent in particular."
"167",6761,"TGO",66,2011,"My country  Togo  welcomes the election of the President of the Assembly to direct the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. On behalf of the Government and people of Togo and on my own behalf  I would like to convey our warm congratulations to him. We wish him every success in accomplishing his noble and exhilarating mission.  Today more than ever  the ever increasing number of challenges facing the planet call for greater solidarity to provide an effective global solution worthy of our peoples’ aspirations. When world leaders bringing forth their nations’ ambitions meet in this forum to reflect upon the main issues of the hour  it is to give their people hope for a brighter tomorrow.   23 11-51372   In order to address those various challenges  Togo has for several years endeavoured to relaunch its economy to achieve sustainable development for the well-being of its people. We have made strengthening national unity and good governance  reviving economic growth and combating social injustice our rallying cry.  In terms of political governance  Togo remains faithful to its new vision of sharing its victory with all stakeholders of goodwill  including political parties that have lost in elections. Above all  this is about emphasizing the peoples’ victory and not that of any political party. In our opinion  that concept of power should inspire all leaders who seek greater stability following elections.  Based on its desire to strengthen the gains made in the area of democratization  the Government of Togo supports the implementation of the recommendations made by the European Union election observation mission  including institutional and constitutional reforms  especially against the backdrop of the local and legislative elections to be held in 2012. In that respect  faithful to the policy of openness and cooperation initiated by our head of State  the Government has renewed its dialogue with all political and civic stakeholders under its permanent framework for dialogue and cooperation in order to pursue discussions on all subjects concerning the management of governmental affairs.  The Truth  Justice and Reconciliation Commission  launched two years ago with the task of promoting national reconciliation  is currently at the critical stage of holding both public and closed hearings  according to witness preference. That is an opportunity for all Togolese men and women to talk to each other about the most painful moments of their history and to speak truthfully in order to ensure justice and reconciliation  thereby making it possible to turn the page once and for all.  In terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms  the Government of Togo has made commitments to increasing State capacities to protect individuals and property and guarantee fundamental freedoms in order to prevent Togo’s young democracy from losing ground with regard to the progress made in shaping its identity  as well as to avert any exploitation of differences. In that regard  Togo has just provided the governing body of the Human Rights Council in Geneva with its national report in connection with the universal periodic review that will take place in a few weeks.   Togo would like to reaffirm its determination to honour its international commitments. We will continue to combat all types of human rights violations and to take action against their perpetrators. My country will therefore tirelessly continue the work already begun in order to strengthen the gains of democracy and peace  while making greater efforts to implement the Millennium Development Goals.  In terms of economic governance  Togo is pursuing reforms for better management of its public finances  in order to optimize domestic revenues. We are working for a more robust financial sector  privatizing public banks  operationalizing the Court of Auditors and instituting a new public tendering code that is fully aligned with international standards. All that is in addition to the steps we have taken towards membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Among other things  those various measures have allowed us to successfully conclude our participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and to benefit from about $1.8 billion in debt cancellation. The broad ongoing programme to improve and rehabilitate road infrastructure throughout our national territory is an illustration of the effective implementation of this reform. On behalf of the Government and the people of Togo  I would like to thank all our partners that have assisted in our process to improve governance.   This meeting is taking place at a time when Africa is again threatened by famine such as we have not witnessed in 20 years. All countries  as well as the United Nations  must take urgent measures to confront that exceptional situation if we wish to avoid a large-scale humanitarian tragedy.  With respect to resolving conflict and promoting peace and security throughout the world  which is the theme of this session  it is encouraging to note that significant progress has been made. That is particularly in the case in Africa  where peace and security have been restored in Côte d’Ivoire  thereby enabling the relaunching of socio-economic activities in that country.  The peaceful resolution of the lengthy conflict in South Sudan  which has become the Organization’s 193rd Member State  gives us reason to hope that any conflict can be resolved acceptably and sustainably so    11-51372 24  long as the parties concerned work in good faith to achieve that goal.  Also as we meet here  parts of the world continue to face waves of demonstrations and uprisings  especially in Africa. Those legitimate movements contribute to the blossoming of democracy for the people concerned. In addition to delivering on their legitimate expectations  they also help to avoid any risk of wavering in the medium term that might jeopardize peace and national unity. That seems to be true for all conflicts  because we believe that no sustainable solution is possible outside of negotiation.   With regard to the Middle East  my country therefore firmly believes that the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the international community must continue to seek a political solution to that old conflict. The Middle East must know peace. Israel and Palestine must coexist in two States with well-defined borders  in peace and security. We are fundamentally convinced that the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a national State and those of Israel for sustainable peace and security are not contradictory  but complementary  objectives.   Despite the many efforts and determination of the United Nations to eradicate terrorism in all its forms  that scourge is gaining even more ground and is compromising the chances for building a world of peace and security. This year  as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the tragic attacks on 11 September 2001  the international community and all States must continue to work synergistically so that humankind will not again experience such indiscriminate and wanton attacks as those of 9/11 or those that recently victimized the peaceful people of Norway and the headquarters of the United Nations in Abuja.  Those crises and conflicts  as well as new threats to international peace and security  such as maritime piracy  cyber crime and drug trafficking  which undermine efforts to build peace throughout the world  require the international community to rethink the role of the United Nations in the context of security and socio-economic development. At a time when the West African subregion is witnessing an increase in violence due to drug trafficking and terrorism in the area  we cannot allow our shorelines to be taken hostage by pirates  as was recently the case in the waters off Benin and Togo. I call for stricter cooperation among all countries to effectively combat this new phenomenon.   As I just said we need to rethink the role of the United Nations. While it is widely acknowledged that nothing can replace the Organization  it is just as true that  65 years after it was established  the United Nations needs to be reformed. My country therefore calls on Member States to pursue and conclude the process of Security Council reform  which began more than 15 years ago. Like the majority of Member States  Togo hopes that this General Assembly session will provide us an opportunity to take decisive steps with regard to Council reform. In so doing  we have the opportunity to correct flagrant and unacceptable injustices and to make the Security Council truly representative of all the regions of the world  thereby making it better placed to resolve the crises and conflicts that we face.  With regard to the process of replacing non-permanent members of the Council  the Assembly will elect five new members in October to replace those whose terms will end on 31 December. Togo is among the candidates from the Group of African States that are seeking the votes of Member States in those elections.   Contrary to the practice observed today in Africa with respect to elections to the Security Council  three candidates are in the running this year for the two seats that go to Africa. Togo  whose candidacy enjoys the endorsement of the Economic Community of Western African States and the African Union  of course attaches great importance to the sovereign right of each State to apply for a seat on any United Nations body. However  I would like to ask all delegations to bear in mind the need to see emerge  after the elections  a Security Council that is balanced and representative of all the major regions in Africa  especially West Africa.  My country has participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations for many years. We are currently involved in the missions in Côte d’Ivoire and the Sudan  and will soon participate in the one in South Sudan. We wish to sit on the Council in order to make a contribution  however modest  to the work of the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.   If elected  Togo will focus on the importance of preventive diplomacy in the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the link between peace and security  on the one hand  and social justice and development  on the other. We would also not neglect combating the   25 11-51372  scourges to which I referred earlier  as well as new threats to international peace and security.   Togo’s noble ambition can only come to pass if we have the support of delegations for our candidacy. It is my hope that all Member States will wish to provide their invaluable support for our candidacy. I wish very much to thank them in advance for their support."
"168",6806,"THA",66,2011,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  allow me to extend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. It is a personal honour for me to speak for the first time before this gathering of the world’s nations. Please be assured of my delegation’s full support and cooperation in the conduct of the work of this body.  The year 2011 has already become a monumental year in modern history. The call for reforms in the Middle East and North Africa has led to unprecedented transitions and popular uprisings. The so-called Arab Spring underscores the significance of people’s legitimate aspirations and the need to respond adequately to them. In this age of globalization  information  ideas and values flow beyond borders.   For Thailand  after experiencing some political unrest  the country has taken another step forward in its democratic process. The general elections held on 3 July this year went smoothly  which is a testament to the resilience of Thai democracy. The new Government has been successfully formed  with a solid mandate from the people. Indeed  the voter turnout was the highest in Thailand’s electoral history. The Administration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is now working resolutely to deliver on the promises it made during the election campaign. In implementing people-centred policies  it seeks to establish a strong    35 11-51670  equitable and sustainable economic infrastructure in the country. More importantly  the Government is determined to promote reconciliation and uphold the rule of law to serve as a basis for harmony and unity within the country.  As far as our foreign relations are concerned  the Government will further enhance relations with neighbouring countries and our friends outside the region. Special emphasis is placed on promoting trust  confidence and mutual respect  which is particularly important as we prepare for the realization of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Community in 2015. We will also strengthen international cooperation at all forums and levels  particularly with the United Nations.  Thailand seeks to play a responsible and constructive role in the current international order. Thailand is convinced that the three pillars of the United Nations - peace and security  development and human rights - are all interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They are issues that need to be addressed comprehensively in order to achieve the ultimate goal of human security for our peoples. They are also issues that Thailand will emphasize in its cooperation with the United Nations.  In terms of peace and security  Thailand believes that this year’s theme for the General Assembly’s general debate  as proposed by you  Mr. President  is very timely. Mediation is a crucial tool for helping to resolve disputes peacefully. The recent birth of the Republic of South Sudan and its swift admission to the United Nations are clear testaments to the constructive role of Mediterranean and the continued engagement of the United Nations in conflict resolution. Thailand welcomes the Republic of South Sudan into the global community  and wishes to forge bilateral relations and a partnership for development with this new State.  Thailand is convinced that the peaceful resolution of conflicts is the most desirable and cost-effective approach in terms of both human lives and financial expense. For that reason  political will remains a key ingredient without which such an approach cannot be successful.   Wishing to do our part  Thailand has actively supported the comprehensive peace operations and peacekeeping missions of the United Nations in more than 20 locations around the world. We are currently deploying an infantry battalion with the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We have also sent police and military officers to the United Nations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and Haiti  and we are about to deploy military officers to a United Nations operation in Kashmir. In addition  since autumn 2010 Thailand has sent two counter-piracy task groups to join international efforts to patrol and protect ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden area. These are just a few examples of our effort to play a meaningful role in maintaining international peace and security.  If international stability is one of our primary goals  Thailand firmly believes that a key foundation for lasting peace is sustainable development. Sustainable development is an essential tool for eradicating poverty and inequality  which are root causes of insecurity. As the guiding principle of our social and economic policy  Thailand has long taken a people-centred approach and adheres to the sufficiency-economy philosophy of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej  which focuses on living in moderation and striking a balance between economic growth and the sustainable management of natural resources.  Our Government is also working resolutely to ensure  among other things  equal opportunity for all  free primary and secondary education  and universal health care coverage. Although we have achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead of schedule  we are resolutely pursuing the MDG Plus targets. In the greater scheme of things  we are determined that no one in Thai society should be left behind.  In order for sustainable development to be realized  cooperation among all sectors of society and partnerships with the international community are essential. Thailand has been active in promoting partnerships between developed and developing countries  and stands ready to serve as a bridge between both groups through triangular cooperation. At the same time  we will continue to strengthen South-South cooperation with our fellow developing countries  including those in the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China.  Thailand has also assumed a more creative and proactive role in cooperation with the international community in various development areas. Over the years  relations between the United Nations and    11-51670 36  Thailand have evolved from a traditional donor-recipient relationship to one of partners in development.  Neither development nor peace and security can be sustainable if respect for human rights lags behind. Thailand firmly believes that human rights represent truly universal values. Respect for them must be a fundamental principle in every society. For Thailand  human rights issues are at the core of our domestic and foreign policy agendas. In terms of foreign policy  Thailand has striven to play a constructive role at the regional and international levels  especially through our membership of the Human Rights Council. During our presidency of the Council  Thailand was proud to direct the crucial task of reviewing its methods of work and operations in order to make it more relevant and credible. This was particularly important when it came to responding to urgent human rights situations in a more timely and effective manner.  Every Government must find its own solutions and move at its own pace in a manner appropriate to its specific context and conditions. Meanwhile  it is incumbent on the international community to support and promote constructive dialogue and engagement with countries of concern  while respecting their sovereignty  territorial integrity and the will of the people. Such support and dialogue should aim at strengthening States’ capacity to meet their human rights obligations. Here it is important  in Thailand’s view  to find common ground on the value of technical cooperation in enhancing human rights. We have been holding consultations on an initiative to enhance the efficiency of the Human Rights Council in providing technical cooperation to countries in need. Thailand hopes that this initiative will receive the broad-based support of countries from all regions in the Council.  With our genuine commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights  Thailand is determined to continue playing a constructive role in the Council. In that regard  we will proudly stand for election once again for the 2015-2017 term. As Thailand continues to enhance its participation as a member of the Human Rights Council  we are determined to further contribute to human rights work and to strengthen the rights of vulnerable groups  both at home and abroad. We attach special importance to such groups  be they children  women  people with disabilities or the elderly.   One notable example is in the area of women’s rights. In December 2010  the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders  or the Bangkok Rules (resolution 65/229)  based on an initiative of Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha. The Rules aim to enhance the human rights of female prisoners in criminal justice systems by fully recognizing gender sensitivity and the specific needs of women. Thailand is committed to promoting the implementation of the Bangkok Rules worldwide and looks forward to continuing to work closely with all relevant stakeholders. Moreover  the recent election of the country’s first female Prime Minister confirms that Thai society is open to women and that we continue to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women.  It should be evident from all I have said that the United Nations is a cornerstone of Thailand’s foreign policy  and that Thailand has been an active player in all three pillars of the United Nations. Peace and security  development and human rights are truly inseparable and should be strengthened simultaneously. Given our past experience and continued contributions to all three  especially the maintenance of international peace and security  Thailand has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We seek the support of our friends in the United Nations in this regard. We are convinced that such a position would enable us to fulfil our commitment to work closely and constructively with all Members of the United Nations. Let us rise to the challenge together."
"169",6831,"TJK",66,2011,"Allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I have every confidence that his wealth of experience will contribute to the achievement of important results in our collective work. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General.  Two weeks ago the people of Tajikistan celebrated a solemn event in their modern history — the twentieth anniversary of independence for the Republic of Tajikistan. Despite numerous difficulties and challenges  the Republic of Tajikistan  during the years of its independence  has succeeded in achieving considerable progress and laying a foundation for gradual social and economic development. We greatly appreciate the contributions made by the United Nations and its Member States to the establishment and development of an independent  sovereign and democratic Tajikistan  governed by the rule of law.  The maintenance of peace and security remains a top priority for the entire international community. For this reason  it is essential that Member States shoulder their due responsibilities and take the joint measures necessary to bring a speedy halt to wars and conflicts. We welcome the settlement in South Sudan and the accession of the Republic of the South Sudan as the new  193rd Member of the United Nations. Tajikistan also calls on all parties concerned to maximize their efforts towards a speedy and full settlement of the continuing conflict in the Middle East. We support the State of Palestine in its efforts to take its well-deserved place as a fully fledged member of the community of nations.  The Government of Tajikistan  aware of its responsibility for addressing social and economic issues  has been working consistently to maximize its own capacity to attain the Millennium Development Goals. Implementation of our national strategy for development of the Republic of Tajikistan is a key priority of our Government. Proceeding from principles of sustainable development for our economy  the Government of Tajikistan has identified three major goals: ensuring energy and food security  and tackling the country’s isolation in terms of communications.  International trade and direct investments can also help in achieving our development goals. We believe that the international trade system must remain open  fair  predictable and non-discriminatory. Guided by these principles  Tajikistan is currently in active talks on joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). In this regard  we are seeking the support of WTO member States to help speed up the process of Tajikistan’s entry.  The problems of climate change and its negative effects cannot be overcome without the collective and    11-51390 10  coordinated efforts of the entire international community. We know that climate change affects fresh water resources as well as exacerbating extreme floods  landslides  droughts and other natural disasters. In Tajikistan  where about 60 per cent of the water resources for the whole of Central Asia originate  more than 35 per cent of glaciers have disappeared in the last 30 years. The accelerated melting of glaciers creates additional risks for sustainable development and regional water  energy and food security. In that regard  at the United National Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  the President of Tajikistan put forward a proposal to set up an international fund for saving glaciers  which could combine the efforts of the international community in this strategically important area. We hope that Member States will support this initiative.  The comprehensive development of hydroelectricity  combined with other types of renewable energy  will enable us not only to increase the capacity of our energy systems but also to enhance their stability and increased efficiency  and considerably decrease harmful emissions into the atmosphere. For more than 10 years  the Republic of Tajikistan has experienced a severe electric power shortage in winter. Owing to a lack of other energy sources  it is vital that Tajikistan  which possesses enormous hydropower potential  begin to undertake consistent  comprehensive development of its hydro-energy sector.  Tajikistan is prepared to cooperate closely on all issues of the rational use of water and energy resources with every country in the region and with due consideration for common regional interests. This has been repeatedly emphasized by the President of Tajikistan  Mr. Emomali Rahmon  including in the General Assembly’s general debate at its sixty-third and sixty-fourth sessions  and in other international forums on the subject of water.  As is well known  in the second half of the twentieth century the Central Asian region was confronted with a massive ecological crisis: the drying up of the Aral Sea. Wilful disregard for rational  careful and responsible use of natural resources has led to the death  for all practical purposes  of the Aral Sea. The enormous number of reservoirs that have been built and continue to be built across vast areas downstream of the Aral Sea have also contributed considerably to its drying up. The total water content of those reservoirs and bodies of water represents 1.5 times the water content of the Aral Sea. Overcoming this crisis will require not just massive capital investment in the water sector but also political will and a readiness to implement long-term joint measures for the rational use of water and energy resources throughout the Aral Sea region.   It is for this reason that Tajikistan suggested that the United Nations should carry out a comprehensive expert study of water use in Central Asia  including on issues related to the effectiveness and rationality of the use of existing reservoirs and an investigation of the environmental situation in the region as a whole.  Water is a crucial resource of immense importance to sustainable development and to life on our planet. We need to strengthen international and regional water cooperation through the effective use of existing mechanisms and instruments. With that in mind  Tajikistan called for the proclamation of 2013 as the International Year of Water Cooperation.  Terrorism is one of the major threats to the international peace and security. Tajikistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe that we must swiftly adopt a universal convention on international terrorism.   The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is part of the fight against terrorism. The urgency of this problem is a clear indication of the threat it poses to international stability and security. My country is making its contribution to the fight against the drug trade. We have set up an anti-drugs body that cooperates with other international organizations and similar services of other States in taking measures to fight illicit drug trafficking in our region.   Tajikistan reiterates its commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. My country unreservedly supports a mine-free Central Asia. We support the adoption of measures leading to the demining of mined areas and the tackling of other mine-related problems.  Tajikistan is concerned at the situation in the neighbouring country of Afghanistan. It was with great sorrow that we learned of the tragic death of the former President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  Mr. Burhanuddin Rabbani. He was one of the most important figures in recent Afghan history and  indeed    11 11-51390  in the region and the world as a whole. We would like to express our heartfelt condolences to the people and the Government of Afghanistan.  Tajikistan supports the international strategy for a comprehensive peace settlement in Afghanistan and post-conflict rehabilitation. We deem it important to involve Afghanistan in regional integration through economic and trade cooperation with neighbouring countries. I should like to recall the efforts of the Dushanbe quartet — Afghanistan  Pakistan  the Russian Federation and Tajikistan — in favour of trade and economic cooperation  the fight against terrorism and the fight against drugs and organized crime.  We have opened five bridges on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan  and three additional bridges are being built. This year we also constructed a 220-kilovolt power line linking Tajikistan and Afghanistan. We are seeking to address the issue of energy shortages in Afghanistan and in Pakistan by building up the hydro-electrical capacity of the Central Asian countries through the CASA-1000 project.  The continued post-conflict economic development of Afghanistan is on the agenda of the fifth Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan  to be held next spring in Dushanbe.  Global problems and regional challenges cannot be addressed without a strengthened United Nations. The process of reforming the United Nations must be carried out in a rational manner  and the renewed United Nations must become a strong partner that is able to react to events across the world and rise to the multiple global challenges that we face in this new age.  Tajikistan will continue to assist the United Nations in every possible way in its efforts to build a peaceful  secure and healthy planet."
"170",6852,"TKM",66,2011,"I sincerely greet all gathered here and offer congratulations on the opening of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I congratulate His Excellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly at this session and express confidence that the Assembly under his leadership will work successfully and fruitfully.  Allow me to convey my gratitude to Mr. Joseph Deiss  President at the sixty-fifth session  for his   9 11-51185  effective activity in this post. In availing myself of this opportunity I should also like once again to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to the post of Secretary-General and wish him great success.  As in past years  this forum is the continuation of the process of forming suitable approaches to the complex phenomena of the modern world — in other words  a search for appropriate answers to questions having global significance. It becomes more and more evident that there is a demand for systemic measures based on a clear definition of goals  a vision of their possible implementation and a choice of effective international mechanisms.   Turkmenistan formulates these goals as follows: peace through development. Today these concepts cannot be considered separately. The direct connection between peace and development is exactly what opens wide possibilities for the consolidation of political will and the intellectual and material resources of the community of nations. That is important in order to establish sustainable  stable and  at the same time  flexible and balanced modern systems of international ties in politics  economics and in the humanitarian sphere.   We are convinced that this large-scale issue and the responsibility for its implementation lie first and foremost with the United Nations. Turkmenistan acts accordingly in forming its approaches to the issues of achieving a firm peace and security  implementing the development goals and realizing humanitarian cooperation.   Considering that a fundamental condition for ensuring long-term peace and strategic stability is to efficiently abide by the United Nations Charter  Turkmenistan pursues a steady and purposeful policy of peace and good-neighbourliness and actively encourages peaceful processes. We absolutely reject military force as an instrument of foreign policy and intergovernmental relations. We believe that solutions through armed force do not offer prospects for success  do not eliminate sources of and reasons for clashes or contradictions  and in most cases do not create conditions for supplying appropriate answers to many questions that arise in post-conflict periods.   Turkmenistan attaches paramount importance to the settlement of any situation by peaceful means and methods. In that connection and in compliance with the fundamental documents of the United Nations  we suggest that at this session the Assembly start to develop a declaration on the critical introduction of political and diplomatic tools for the resolution of international issues  with further consideration at subsequent sessions. To our way of thinking  adopting such a declaration would allow for a considerable decrease in the probability of the use of force to resolve clashes in intergovernmental relations. It would help to reduce the risks concerned and threats to general stability and security.   At the regional level  we have proposed a number of initiatives on maintaining peace and stability in Central Asia and in the Caspian basin. These initiatives were welcomed positively. In our opinion  the next step must be taken  namely  to arrange a representative forum on security in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea region. Turkmenistan suggests hosting this event next year. We believe that the establishment of an advisory council on peaceful development in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea region may emerge as one of the political outcomes of that forum.  In talking of the necessity to ensure security on a global scale  we do not mean only its political component. Global security is considered as a comprehensive whole  based on indivisibility and a whole range of key factors that define the vectors of today’s worldwide development. That involves the solution of economic  energy  ecological  food and humanitarian issues.   Today it is obvious that global security cannot be provided unless peace and consent at national and regional levels are reached. Therefore Turkmenistan aims its efforts at the maximum promotion of the processes of sustainable development  attaining the Millennium Development Goals and creating efficient models of multilateral reciprocal action for the solution of urgent international issues.   A reliable and stable transit of energy resources on the international market is one of the issues at hand. Our proposals on the matter received support from the world community and were reflected in General Assembly resolution 63/210  adopted in 2008. I believe that the time has come to start developing concrete measures on the resolution of energy transport issues.  With a view to joining the efforts of the Member States that are taking an active part in the development of an international legal foundation in the sphere of    11-51185 10  energy supply  Turkmenistan considers it appropriate to create a new mechanism  transparent and open to all: an interregional energy dialogue under the aegis of the United Nations  supposing that the Organization would actively promote establishment of an essential format of cooperation. We see the States of Central and South Asia  the Caspian  the Black Sea and Baltic regions  Russia  China  the European Union and the countries of the Middle and Near East — all States  companies and international financial institutions concerned — being among its participants. The acknowledgment by United Nations Member States of the general nature of the long-term goals of development and a readiness to achieve their implementation jointly act today as determining factors for the sustainability of the global economic system.  The serious effects of the worldwide financial and economic crisis have clearly demonstrated once again the need to unite efforts to form viable models and realistic plans  taking account of the interests and needs of all States of the world. Turkmenistan will take an active part in this process and will contribute to the exchange of successful experiences gained by our country on a number of fronts involving economic and social development.   We are ready to do this through the relevant United Nations structures  first of all the Economic and Social Council. Our country submits its candidature for membership in that authoritative body for the term of 2013-2015. We are preparing for the work in this body  and  if elected  Turkmenistan will spare no efforts to successfully implement the tasks entrusted.  Turkmenistan will also take part in the Rio+20 Earth Summit in 2012. We see it as a landmark event in the process of making progress towards sustainable development objectives. We intend to announce a number of specific proposals at that forum.   With regard to maintaining sustainable economic growth  I should like to dwell on a crucial component  namely  the creation of a modern transport infrastructure.   Over the years our country  together with partners in the region  has been actively working on the implementation of major projects to optimize traffic flow in the Eurasian sphere. We believe this is a very promising area  given the huge potential of the north-south and east-west corridors. It is important that those corridors  which could give a powerful impetus to economic development and trade relations on a continental scale  be used effectively. We believe that the United Nations could play an important role in coordinating the establishment of international cooperation in the field of transport.   In that regard  Turkmenistan suggests that there be an initiative  during the current session  to start developing a United Nations special programme on the development of transport  including the study of transit and transport opportunities between the Caspian and Black Seas and between Central Asia and the Middle East.  Turkmenistan sees the environmental sphere as a key area for international cooperation. We respect the initiatives and decisions taken at the summits on climate change in Copenhagen and Cancun. We are looking forward to continuing a constructive international dialogue on this issue in November this year at the meeting in Durban. We are convinced of the need to join efforts in this field at the global  regional and national levels and to coordinate the actions of each United Nations Member State. In that connection I should like to emphasize that Turkmenistan is currently preparing an extensive document  the National Strategy on Climate Change. After the adoption of the Strategy we will be ready to submit it to the relevant United Nations agencies as a contribution to our common work. We believe that it will be possible  during the current session and in the context of closer multilateral cooperation  to start establishing systemic machinery in this area. To that end  Turkmenistan proposes establishing a specialized institution — a United Nations interregional centre on development and issues related to climate change. We are willing to provide for its functioning with all the necessary infrastructure in the capital of Turkmenistan  Ashgabat.  A most important question that goes far beyond regional boundaries is the environment of the Caspian Sea. Here we are also convinced of the need to give specific content to international efforts to preserve the unique natural resources of the Caspian Sea. In that regard we propose organizing a Caspian environmental forum as a permanent body to deal with environmental issues in the Caspian basin  as well as to make appropriate proposals and recommendations.  Achieving sustainable development is directly related to the resolution of humanitarian issues  support   11 11-51185  for natural human rights  and opportunities for individuals to achieve personal fulfilment and for people to lead valuable lives. In that regard our country will continue its cooperation with United Nations humanitarian bodies for further implementation of United Nations conventions in the field of human rights. As a permanent member of the Executive Committee of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  Turkmenistan will actively promote the implementation of practical measures aimed at protecting and supporting refugees. We have found it useful  in working with UNHCR  to study our experience in granting citizenship to refugees and stateless persons and to organize  in that connection  an international meeting involving all stake-holders in Ashgabat in 2012.  The challenges facing the Organization are complex and ambitious  but they are realistic and achievable because we have a common goal  namely  to make the world a better  fairer and more humane place. We are united by common values and shared responsibility. We are united in our endeavour to move forward. We rely on the vast experience gained by the United Nations over the decades  as well as on the will  intellect and wisdom of the community of nations. All of this will determine the extent of our overall success. Today each country makes its own unique contribution to the development and progress of mankind. This opens up enormous opportunities for creating and implementing new ideas  for developing innovative models of cooperation to address key issues in modern times. Turkmenistan is ready to take an active part in this activity  firmly following a strategic course aimed at close and comprehensive cooperation with the United Nations."
"171",6866,"TLS",66,2011,"It is a great pleasure for me to be back at the United Nations Headquarters. Last February I had the honour of taking part in a Security Council meeting  where I took the opportunity to thank the permanent members and all    11-51197 12  other nations that have been part of the Council for the generosity and care that have always been present in the resolutions on Timor-Leste. Today  on behalf of the people of Timor-Leste  I want to take this opportunity to thank all Members of this forum for the support they have given to Timor-Leste in the promotion of peace and security and in the building of our national institutions. I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that we have come a long way as a people and as a State  replacing intolerance with constructive dialogue and the right to protest with the duty to protest responsibly. We have taken firm steps to put the difficult circumstances of the past behind us  and we have renewed the confidence of the Timorese people in the institutions of the State. As such we have already endorsed the Joint Transition Plan for the withdrawal of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste by the end of 2012.  We are in the last year of the five-year mandate of the Coalition Government that I have the honour of leading — the Parliamentary Majority Alliance (AMP)  which includes five different political parties. Under the Constitution of Timor-Leste the Government is determined either by the party with the most elected representatives or by an alliance of parties with a parliamentary majority  as it is our National Parliament that is elected directly by the people and not the Government itself. A government can be constituted only if it is supported by a parliamentary majority. Following the 2007 elections the party with the most parliamentary representatives did not have a majority in its own right  so the President of the Republic  after formally meeting with all parties  endorsed a coalition government in order to provide the best opportunity for stable government. This constitutional option served the best interests of the nation  as we were living in a period of great fragility at that time as demonstrated by the instability and violence that were the consequences of the 2006 crisis.  Having inherited an unstable national situation  the AMP Government focused on restoring peace and stability and resolving the many social and political problems that stemmed from the 2006 crisis and continued into 2008. We were determined to put an end to the violent outbreaks that began in 2000 and were repeated every two years  as though Timor-Leste was trapped in a vicious cycle of violence. The key to breaking the cycle was to acknowledge and admit that we had failed. We had to address the root causes of our problems and learn to deal with the frailty of our State institutions. Fortunately we were successful in conveying a strong political message about the need for stability. The AMP Government committed itself to a reform agenda and by governing through dialogue was able to: initiate vital reforms in the defence and security sectors  including capacity-building and professionalizing the police and defence forces; implement structural reforms in the State Administration’s management; create systems and structures to ensure good governance  while continuing to support capacity-building in the justice sector; introduce fairer social policies to reduce the imbalance that existed in the society  taking into account the physical  moral and psychological damage of a 24-year-long war  and here I am speaking about veterans and the elderly  who sacrificed themselves for our independence and who  directly or indirectly  have suffered the consequences of a devastating war; encourage structured policies on education  health and agriculture; and promote a coherent economic policy throughout Timor-Leste to encourage the fledgling private sector.  In 2009  on the tenth anniversary of the referendum  the Government launched a new motto: “Goodbye conflict  welcome development”. The people of Timor-Leste embraced this motto wholeheartedly. In looking forward to the period 2011-2020 we are confident that we are now truly becoming a more stable and tolerant society that is peaceful by nature. We also have the necessary optimism to initiate a bolder period of development.  Over the past four years we have been strengthening the institutional capacity of our public administration to defend the best interests of the State  improve public-service delivery  and promote good governance.  We have introduced reforms in the area of public finance management and we have created a Civil Service Commission. We have also created an Anti-Corruption Commission and begun to establish a Chamber of Accounts to promote transparency and accountability in our public accounts. Earlier this year we launched an on-line transparency portal and procurement portal providing access to data that is updated daily and that deals with the process of the Timor-Leste State general budget and its execution. These portals also allow public consultation on advertised public projects.   13 11-51197   We have also begun to develop the capacity of our private sector by promoting competence  professional honesty and technical skills. Our aim is to transform the private sector into a strong partner with Government at this crucial period when we are building our country. Across the country we have invested in agriculture to increase the productivity of the sector  as well as local and decentralized development programmes focused on minor infrastructure projects to promote employment for young people in rural areas. Such measures have contributed to our economic growth and helped create jobs in the capital  Dili  and in rural areas  and they have encouraged confidence in our State institutions and led to a spirit of optimism that has contributed to a change in mindset.  Timor-Leste is a country blessed with great natural wealth  which means that we have the financial capacity to improve the living conditions of our people. However  we know that countries rich in natural resources often perform below their economic potential and are more vulnerable to conflict and more susceptible to bad governance. As such  transparency and good governance  which are essential in any country  become even more imperative for countries that are rich in natural resources. Currently  the Petroleum Fund of Timor-Leste has a balance of $8.9 billion. We are the first country in Asia and the third in the world to be compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. As a result of our good governance and prudent use of revenue  Timor-Leste has had double-digit growth in the past few years. We believe that we are on the path to maintain this growth  and we are confident that the institutions we have established to support the Fund will become stronger  ensuring responsiveness and greater quality of work and execution. We will diversify the investment of our Petroleum Fund equally in bonds and equities to guarantee long-term sustainability  so that future generations will benefit in the same way as the current post-war generation.   Having achieved our goal of stability we were in a position to prepare a 20-year strategic development plan  which would replace the annual plan for each fiscal year. The plan covers three vital areas — social capital  infrastructure and economic development. In terms of economic development we are focused on three strategic industry sectors — the hydrocarbon industry  the agriculture sector and tourism. We want to shift from an oil-dependent economy to a non-oil-dependent economy. All the strategies and actions set out in the plan aim to transform Timor-Leste from a low-income country to an upper middle-income country with a healthy  well-educated and safe population that is prosperous and self-sufficient in terms of food. This new paradigm requires public investment in infrastructure and services and a dynamic private sector. Many emerging economies  particularly in the Asian region  have been growing despite the serious international financial crisis.  Next year will be very important for us to consolidate our process of State-building and to affirm ourselves as a sovereign  tolerant and democratic nation. In 2012 we will hold presidential and legislative elections  the third democratic elections in Timor-Leste  which I am confident will be conducted peacefully. Next year we will also celebrate vital historic dates that connect us to the more recent past  namely  the struggle for independence  and to older roots that make us unique within the region and the world.  In addition to celebrating the tenth anniversary of the restoration of independence  in 2012 we will also celebrate the centenary of the Manufahi Revolt and the 500-year anniversary of the arrival of the first Portuguese navigators in Timor-Leste. I should like to take this opportunity to invite all to take part in these celebrations  in the same spirit of thanks and solidarity as the invitation that we extended to our independence celebrations in 2002. We were not alone on that important date  and we continue to benefit from the generosity and support of nations throughout the world. We are pleased to continue to strengthen and to expand our ties of solidarity with friendly countries from various continents with different stories  different beliefs and different ethnicities.   We are trying to be more active in our region and in the world  showing that it is possible to leave behind  or to close  a period of conflict  even a long period  and to focus our energy on humanist ideals of political and social tolerance for the dignity and development of all. That is why we are intent on joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Timor-Leste desires peace and shares the spirit of cooperation that led to the creation of that regional organization. We are also continuing to build upon our relationships with our friends in Asia and the Pacific     11-51197 14  including China  Japan  South Korea  Australia and New Zealand  among others.   Timor-Leste is strongly committed as well to its membership in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries which consists of nations and peoples from the four corners of the world. We are observers in the Pacific Islands Forum and we have a good relationship with the European Union  which provides significant support and assistance. Next week I will make an official visit to Portugal  which shares ties with Timor-Leste that go back hundreds of years. Despite being in one of the worst economic and financial crises in its history  exacerbated by the global and European financial crisis  Portugal remains a steadfast partner of Timor-Leste and has strengthened its bilateral cooperation in several areas. The first Timorese military personnel are being trained in Portugal and will be integrated into the Portuguese contingent that will participate in the peacekeeping mission in Lebanon under the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  Timor-Leste is one of the 50 States classified as a least developed country (LDC). We are also called a fragile State. That classification stems from institutional  political  economic  social and other factors. In April last year we had the honour to host an international dialogue in Dili on the subject of “Peace-building and State-building” with the participation of LDCs from the group we call the Group of Seven Plus (g7+)  which is at present chaired by Timor-Leste. This group is a forum that allows fragile and post-conflict countries to come together and talk about themselves  learn from each other’s experiences and create new possibilities for facing the future with determination and optimism. The g7+ consists of 17 member countries covering around 350 million people from Africa  Asia  the Caribbean and the Pacific. The g7+ also aims to improve the transparency and efficiency of international aid. The group is a mechanism for dialogue with each other and with the international community about aid programmes and aid effectiveness. It should also be noted that fragile States require a period of transition with greater flexibility in donor funding  instead of a policy of one size fits all  which can only interfere with the individual processes of each country.  A high-level forum on development assistance is scheduled to take place next November in Pusan  South Korea. In that forum we will evaluate progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will also set new action frameworks. Under-developed countries focus on meeting Millennium Development Goals every day  although it will be very difficult to meet them by 2015. These countries face daily challenges and difficulties in pursuing objectives to combat poor administration and reduce poverty. Democracy is a process and not an end in itself. Most of these countries are young democracies and have the arduous task of changing the mindset of their people scarred by conflict. They must also deal with internal and external pressures that prevent them from paying too much attention to a series of universal criteria that are too idealized or standardized and not adjusted to the actual situation of those countries. Understanding the specific circumstances of each developing country and motivating the people to cultivate a spirit of hope and belonging will surely yield more results than forcing situations where receiving countries cannot immediately meet the conditions imposed on them  thereby being put in a situation of moral  psychological  political and financial dependency  which does little to help them move towards development.   It is in that context of balanced and sustained development that I raise the issue of aid effectiveness. Poor countries also need a message of confidence  since all they hear about is transparency and accountability. Still  the international economic recession proves that the lessons taught by those with all the power  the knowledge and the money may not always be the best. Therefore  I believe that we must all — poor countries and donor countries — change our attitudes. The United Nations has a vital role to play here in terms of correcting and adjusting aid to actual and local realities.   We remain divided into North and South  into rich and poor  into Westerners and Arabs  into Asians and Africans  into Muslims and non-Muslims  and into Christians and non-Christians. Even today many of the people who hold or influence power still have a Cold War mentality. We need a new world order that is also political and economic  where conflicts and discord are replaced by dialogue  where democracy is used to give voice to the weak and vulnerable and where aid and solidarity are used appropriately to mitigate the suffering of the people. We have to give voice to the peoples of the world and listen to their aspirations. Only through dialogue can we fight violence  which   15 11-51197  causes all kinds of misery. Only through peaceful solutions can we prevent the massive destruction caused by war.   The people of Timor-Leste  who have experienced the pain caused by destruction and violence  hope that their brothers and sisters throughout the world who are suffering today because of conflicts may find peace. However  as everyone says  peace is not only the absence of war  true peace comes from within  the peace of spirit. Therefore  I appeal to the United States of America to demonstrate greatness of spirit and humanism and eliminate the Cuban embargo that has existed for more than 25 years.  Lastly  in 1991 I was still in the mountains leading the resistance when the Western Sahara referendum was first proposed. I was in prison in 1995 when Yasser Arafat  Shimon Perez and Yitzak Rabin received the Nobel Peace Prize. Two Timor-Leste citizens also received the Nobel Peace Prize  and Indonesia accepted the referendum result  just as North Sudan did.  We hope that the people of Western Sahara and Palestine can find more viable  fair and realistic ways through mechanisms that will lead them effectively to the resolution of their conflicts  which  sadly  are becoming the oldest conflicts in the world. We all need to reform our mindsets  attitudes and institutions. We all must start these reforms within our own nations  but I should like to suggest a common challenge here  that these reforms begin right here in this building at the headquarters of the United Nations."
"172",6882,"TON",66,2011,"Like others who have spoken before me  allow me to add my warm congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly for our current session. My delegation and I assure him  as always  of our support and cooperation. I also wish to thank Mr. Joseph Diess of Switzerland for a successful term as President at the sixty-fifth session. We also remember another former President of the Assembly  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland  who passed away earlier this year but who left a lasting impact on the good work of the General Assembly and the United Nations.  As for the ongoing leadership of the Organization  I wish to extend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a deserved second term. He and the Secretariat continue to show the firm resolve needed during these challenging times of global crisis. We pay tribute also to the memory of those members of the Secretariat who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of international duty.  A further example of the critical role played by the Secretary-General during these difficult times was the convening earlier this week of the High-level Meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The dangerous potential of NCDs  unchecked in small States like mine  threatens not just livelihoods and lifestyle but whatever gains may have been achieved as they relate to Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 and the other MDGs.  At our annual meeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders in Auckland earlier this month  we adopted a statement on NCDs in which  among other things  we committed our Governments to implementing five key interventions in areas known to reduce NCDs: Controlling tobacco  improving diets  increasing physical activity  reducing alcohol intake and facilitating access to essential drugs and technologies.   17 11-51372   In that respect  Tonga was pleased to join other Member States in adopting the Political Declaration (resolution 66/2  annex) of the High-level Meeting on the prevention and control of NCDS. I sincerely believe that the Meeting was a good step in the right direction for setting a healthier and enjoyable future for us all.  We were pleased that the Secretary-General was able to visit a number of countries in our region on his way to his historic attendance at the Pacific Islands Forum. He was able to assess for himself the dominant impact of climate change on countries in the Pacific and to validate the activities of Pacific small island developing States like Tonga in international forums. We must use the positive foundations laid down collectively in Copenhagen and Cancún to embrace the promise that might lie in Durban at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December.  We are pleased that  in July  under the able presidency of Germany  the Security Council took solid steps to seize the moral imperative by holding an open debate and producing a presidential statement on the Maintenance of international peace and security and the impact of climate change (S/PRST/2011/15*). The Council and its membership  now and in the future  must not turn from their vigilant duty to keep themselves in a position of leadership over this issue and its implications for Member States like Tonga and others in the Pacific.  While last year’s High-level Meeting on MDGs offered small island developing States like Tonga an opportunity to take stock of their progress towards achieving those Goals in 2015  we consider that we have a similar chance to do so as we all prepare for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development next year. We stress the critical importance of the sustainable development  management and conservation of our ocean and marine resources — living and non-living — as a proper source of livelihood and income for our communities and Governments. Ensuring that States like ours enjoy a greater share of the benefits derived from such resources is key. What we within the Pacific small island developing States have come to refer to as the “blue economy” will be our challenge to the Rio Conference to meet the expectations and development aspirations of our peoples.  As such  Tonga continues to observe its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and notes the decision taken by consensus by the States parties this year relating to the workload of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf  whose work is much valued by coastal States such as mine. Tonga  together with another sister State from the region  again actively participated in the work of the International Seabed Authority this year and noted the decision by the Authority to grant exploration licenses to entities sponsored by our respective Governments. This represents a creative path for States like mine  within the spirit of the Convention  towards solid partnership and development. The common heritage of mankind  if it is to have any true meaning  ought to be common to all and not just to some or the few with the capacity in that area.  Tonga reiterates its call for the creation and definition of a formal small island developing States category within the United Nations system. We are in need of a definition that is not based upon a one-size-fits-all approach. Like others  we must have a definition that separates and addresses those States’ diversity of size  population  remoteness  isolation and different levels of socio-economic development. Such a definition would not only improve linkages within the United Nations system but also  we believe  set a good benchmark for the international community that is both coherent and practical. It would strengthen the position of the United Nations and the international system in addressing small island developing States and the special and unique challenges they face.  Like others  we  too  welcome the Republic of South Sudan as our newest State Member of the United Nations. Tonga has long been supportive of the efforts to find a comprehensive  just and enduring peace in the Middle East. The shifting sands of change known as the Arab Spring throughout the surrounding region earlier this year has made such a peace and genuine security all the more challenging  but not impossible. This is indeed a moment of truth for those with genuine hope  not just for a secure Israel and a viable Palestine  but for those who for so long have had such hopes for an ambitious peace.  Tonga’s interest in developing renewable energy sources  within the context of our Tonga energy road map  continued to evolve with our election to the Council of the International Renewable Energy Agency    11-51372 18  (IRENA) at the first session of the Agency’s Assembly  in April 2011. We will work in earnest to ensure that the voices of developing States such as Tonga and others on the new Council are heard  given the key leading role it will play in the Agency’s decision-making and future direction. To take on such a role  IRENA must be prepared to be innovative. The Agency’s work will take on greater significance in the coming International Year of Sustainable Energy for All and its related activities. I would also like to recognize the strong support of the Government of the United Arab Emirates as host State for IRENA.  I am pleased to have addressed the Assembly as the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Tonga. In the wake of the elections held in November of last year  I took office the following month  in December  after an evolving process of principal reforms that  within the context of our 1875 Constitution  included the peaceful transfer of executive power from His Majesty in Privy Council to the Government of the day; a Parliament in which the majority of members are elected by universal suffrage; a Prime Minister elected by a majority of the elected Members of Parliament; a Cabinet nominated by the Prime Minister and chosen largely from those elected Members of Parliament; a constitutional monarchy; and a strong and independent judiciary free of political influence.  Notwithstanding this peaceful evolution  the fundamental freedoms and values guaranteed under the Constitution continue to afford legal protection and comforting reassurance to all Tongans.  To address the uncertain future of the current global economic and financial climate  my Government has approved the Tonga strategic development framework  which provides an overall framework to guide the Government’s activities for the next four years. It involves nine priority areas  from building strong  inclusive communities to improving health and education standards for a safe  secure and stable Tongan society. Earlier this month  my Government signed separate agreements with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to improve information and communications technology services for Tonga so as to make them affordable and accessible. Improving such services will enable Tonga to enhance its related education  health and Government services as well. My Government sincerely believes that this framework will put Tonga on a firm path to improving its ability to meaningfully achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  As such  in closing my Government happily reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and we pledge to support the ongoing work and reform of the Organization."
"173",6922,"TTO",66,2011,"Mr. President  I congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to preside over the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  and extend the best wishes of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar  and of the Government and people of my country  on whose behalf I address the Assembly.  I also welcome South Sudan as the newest Member of the United Nations.  More than six decades ago  the United Nations was established  among other things  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  promote social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom  and employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.  Notwithstanding instances of conflicts that have threatened to reverse the gains achieved since 1945  the United Nations  with the support of Member States  has achieved some success in maintaining international peace and security. An important ingredient fuelling this success has been the promotion by the United Nations of the principle of the settlement of disputes through pacific or peaceful means.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is very supportive of the President’s choice of the theme for this debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. It provides  in our view  an opportunity for members of the international community to reaffirm their commitment to this important principle  which is not only enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations but also widely accepted as forming part of customary international law.   The Charter is the primary legal instrument governing the conduct of international relations among States. Indeed  Article 33 imposes a binding legal obligation on parties to disputes to settle them first of all through peaceful means. Under Chapter VII  the Security Council is also required  as a first resort  to use peaceful means to resolve disputes that constitute threats to peace  breaches of the peace  and acts of aggression.  We meet at a time when peoples everywhere are seeking more direct roles in the governance of their societies; when they are not prepared to be silent spectators to their plight; when ordinary  law-abiding citizens are prepared to die for the cause of freedom from tyranny and for democracy; when leadership that is anything less than democratic is unacceptable; when social media have united the peoples of the world into a global community with one aspiration — the dignity of the human person; and when the hunger of the souls of peoples of many nations for democracy cannot be appeased by false promises of a distant utopia. Above all  we are witnessing levels of youth alienation and restlessness that challenge leaders to bridge the gap between old cultures and traditions of governance with    11-51398 18  new aspirations. There will be no future that is peaceful unless the cynicism of the young is addressed.  Developments in the Middle East and in North Africa reveal a global growing dissonance among the masses with regimes that trample on the freedoms fundamental to democracy and do not allow for participation in governance. In a world linked by social media  the risk of a people’s uprising that transcends continents and borders is real. It is a kind of social chaos that as leaders we must all prevent. If we do not  the gains we have made will be lost and a kind of anarchy could be set in motion.  What are the reasons for all of this? They have to do with the perception of a denial that people feel exists today. That denial is political in nature in terms of shared governance; it is also material in nature  as it relates to the way people feel about how resources are allocated in their countries; it is also spiritual in nature  because of the general emptiness that people feel when it comes to realizing their human potential.   Politically  the age of totalitarianism and anti-democratic leadership styles is over. When it comes to the use of their countries’ material resources  people wish to see more equitable distribution and application in ways that improve basic standards of living. The ability to eat even a single meal or to receive basic health care  education  affordable public transport and housing is today at the top of the list of people’s priorities. As leaders of the world  we must stop and we must answer. Now more than ever  the world must allocate its resources equitably  ethically  sustainably and transparently.  While we at the United Nations generally talk about mediation as settling differences among nations  perhaps the real mediation has to be between generations. Leaders must now adopt styles of leadership that embrace active listening to the views of those governed. Leaders must develop approaches that build consensus and promote participation  since people now demand a greater say in how their futures are shaped. They want to author that future  not be dictated to. They want to arrive at a destiny that they have shaped  not one that is shaped for them.   The defeat of economic and social demons will come about only when there is unity of purpose  nationally and globally — a reality that is possible only when the energies of all stakeholders are harnessed around a common vision. A common vision cannot be fostered when conflicts  internal or external  are allowed to fester. This results in the further alienation of people who often resort to violence and socially disruptive behaviour to solve disputes.  Trinidad and Tobago has always advocated the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. This is based on our support for an international order founded on respect for the rule of law. In this regard  we hold sacred the territorial sovereignty of States and the inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals. We also view the promotion of justice as indispensable to the maintenance of peace and security at the national  regional and global levels. Nevertheless  none of these objectives would be attainable if there were no systems encouraging Member States to settle disputes peacefully. That is why we have always been vociferous in our support of the work of the International Criminal Court and other tribunals established to promote peace by dispensing justice.  Trinidad and Tobago relies heavily for its economic development on the exploration and exploitation of the living and mineral resources of the maritime zones within our national jurisdiction. In doing this  we have had to delimit our maritime boundaries with neighbouring coastal States in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other applicable rules of international law. I can assure the Assembly that this has been done by peaceful means  either through diplomatic negotiations or by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of annex VII of the Convention.  Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the importance of the need to settle disputes by peaceful means. Consequently  we have become parties to several conventions for settling commercial and investment disputes. These have been given the force of law in our jurisdiction. For example  our 1996 Foreign Arbitral Awards Act gives effect to Trinidad and Tobago’s obligations under the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Additionally  as a State party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States  we also recognize that  like States  foreign nationals who invest in Trinidad and Tobago must be in a position to avail themselves of the conciliation and arbitration services provided by the International Centre for Settlement of   19 11-51398  Investment Disputes  which is an impartial international forum for resolving potential investment disputes. Such treaties not only provide the requisite reassurance for investors  who know that any dispute that may arise will be settled through an objective process; they also serve as incentives for would-be investors to do business in Trinidad and Tobago.  We in Trinidad and Tobago support the position taken by the International Court of Justice and the International Law Commission that all Member States are bound to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State  or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. It is for these reasons that we have always upheld the position that border disputes in our region or any part of the globe should he settled peacefully. It will be recalled that as far back as 1970  Trinidad and Tobago  through the good offices of our former Prime Minister  the late Mr. Eric Williams  facilitated the conclusion of the Protocol of Port-of-Spain  whereby Guyana and Venezuela agreed to a 12-year moratorium on their border dispute.  Since then  Trinidad and Tobago has supported other initiatives mounted by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  the Organization of American States and the United Nations aimed at resolving this dispute by peaceful means. Elsewhere in our region  we have encouraged the use of good offices and mediation to resolve the border dispute between Belize and Guyana  as well as internal disputes in Haiti. Our support for these regional initiatives is in keeping with the provisions of Article 52 of the Charter  which envisions a role for regional organizations in the pacific settlement of disputes.  Further afield  we have always advocated that the Middle East conflict should be settled peacefully. Trinidad and Tobago supports the quest of Palestinians for a State of their own with secure borders  alongside the State of Israel  whose borders must also be secure and free from terrorist attacks. The United Nations must continue to show leadership and work with the Arab League and other entities to resolve the decades-old conflict between Israel and Palestine so that there can be lasting peace in the region. For far too long  we  like the rest of the world  have witnessed the horrendous loss of life and destruction of infrastructure which have erased the hopes and prospects of many young people for a bright future in the place of their birth.  The efforts of States at the national or regional levels for the settlement of disputes emphasize their primary responsibility under the Charter to settle disputes peacefully. These are supplementary to and reinforce the role of the United Nations as mandated under the Charter. Trinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes the renewed emphasis placed by the United Nations on mediation and other means for the peaceful settlement of disputes  as demonstrated in the report of the Secretary-General dated 8 April 2009 (S/2009/189)  as well as the adoption on 22 June 2011 by the General Assembly of its resolution 65/283  entitled “Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution”.  During her contribution to the general debate last year (see A/65/PV.20)  The Honourable Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar  took the political initiative to call on the General Assembly to adopt a resolution on women  disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control. That resolution  which was eventually adopted by the Assembly as resolution 65/69  calls on States to promote the equitable representation of women in all decision-making processes with regard to matters related to disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control.  One year later  the United Nations continues to make strides in placing women at the centre of all of its activities. This has been reflected  for example  in the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). Consistent with this action  Trinidad and Tobago applauds the decision taken by Member States in resolution 65/283  which recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of women at all levels  at all stages and in all aspects of the peaceful settlement of disputes  conflict prevention and resolution  as well as the need to address the lack of women as chief or lead peace mediators.  Women are among the most vulnerable during conflicts  internal or otherwise  and hence must be involved in all vehicles relating to the settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. The absence of women in the process could result in the development of peace agreements which are not comprehensive in    11-51398 20  scope and which may not address those issues that affect women during periods of conflict and which continue thereafter.  The inclusion of women in the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention is related to their involvement in the political process. Women  in whatever part of the world  must not be left out of the political decision-making process. The Honourable Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago continues to demonstrate her commitment to the participation of women in Government in meaningful ways  both nationally and internationally. Her advocacy with respect to this issue resulted in the hosting in Trinidad and Tobago in 2011 of regional seminars to promote this democratic and just cause.   Bearing in mind the significance of this subject  Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar  together with other States  the United Nations Development Programme and UN-Women  successfully co-hosted a high-level colloquium on women’s political participation last Monday in the margins of the General Assembly. It was gratifying and fulfilling to see a room overflowing with women from all over the world championing the common cause of gender equality. The event clearly demonstrated that the small size of a country is not a deterrent to the realization of big dreams and the fulfilment of wholesome ideals in the pursuit of human development.   As part of the colloquium  the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago was among those leaders who signed a declaration on advancing women’s political participation. It is the hope of Trinidad and Tobago that the outcome of this event will promote greater global consciousness and discussions on the participation of women in Government and the advancement of democracy globally. In keeping with the objective of this meeting  Trinidad and Tobago calls on Member States to implement the provisions of resolution 65/283 on the inclusion of women as mediators in the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. At the same time  we would also welcome greater efforts to recruit lead mediators from developing countries and from small countries  particularly small island developing States  including in the Caribbean  consistent with the principle of equitable geographic distribution in the recruitment of United Nations personnel.  Like women  our young people are also very susceptible to the negative effects of strife and therefore they  too  must be protected. A number of cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC) show that the perpetrators are on trial or under investigation for committing war crimes because they conscripted or enlisted children under the age of 15 into their national armed forces or used them to participate actively in hostilities. In addition to mechanisms aimed at bringing the accused to justice  we support all those aimed at rehabilitating young people who have survived conflict so that they can advance  reach their fullest potential and contribute to the development of their societies. This can be achieved if they are able to enjoy their basic human rights. Thus we call on States that are in a position to do so to contribute to UNICEF  the International Committee of the Red Cross and the ICC Trust Fund for Victims  which assist in the rehabilitation of children and other victims of armed conflict.  Trinidad and Tobago endorses a number of other elements contained in resolution 65/283 relating to the strengthening of the position of the United Nations in assisting States to develop their capacity to employ mediation and other peaceful means to resolve disputes. While the adoption of the resolution is laudable  it is only a means to an end. Member States must ensure that all aspects of the resolution are implemented fully. In this regard  Trinidad and Tobago wishes to underscore the importance of the provision of adequate resources to the Department of Political Affairs and its Mediation Support Unit. Without the required resources  the Secretary-General will not be able to effectively use his good offices and other mediation capacities to help resolve existing and future disputes.  The escalation of armed conflict and armed violence is fuelled by several factors. One component is the illegal proliferation of conventional arms  including small arms and light weapons which have been diverted from the legal market to the illicit trade. The United Nations  in keeping with its obligations under the Charter to promote and maintain international peace and security  has recognized the impact of the illegal trade in conventional arms on the peace and security of countries and regions and has adopted several resolutions and implemented different programmes to address this matter.   21 11-51398   But for us in Trinidad and Tobago and the CARICOM region  the most ambitious measure undertaken so far is the decision to convene a conference in July 2012 to negotiate the text of an arms trade treaty. Trinidad and Tobago and its CARICOM partners have been very active in the deliberations of meetings of the Preparatory Committee examining possible elements for inclusion in the treaty. As we approach the 2012 conference and begin to reflect on items to be included in the agreement  considerable care must also be taken to ensure that there are adequate provisions for the settlement of disputes which may arise among future States parties on the interpretation and application of the provisions of the arms trade treaty.  The absence of peaceful means to resolve conflicts has led to genocide  war crimes and other pernicious misdeeds of concern to the international community. In many cases  they have stymied economic growth and social progress and have destroyed human lives. They have limited the capacity of many States in conflict  especially those in the developing world  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We must save current and future generations from the plague of war brought about by intolerance  xenophobia  border disputes and disagreements over the allocation of resources. We in Trinidad and Tobago feel that a concrete way of doing this — an intervention strategy — is to focus  as my country is focusing  on universal preschool education  because we believe that the human values that are inculcated in children from birth until ages 5 or 6 help them to appreciate the value of peace and the value of interpersonal peace.  Additionally  the United Nations and other intergovernmental organizations must address the impatience and restlessness of today’s young people  who are fed up with the misallocation of resources and the lack of both transparency and peoples’ involvement in the processes of governance. Their desires to reshape the world to reflect greater participation  empathy and democratic principles ought not be ignored by leaders. We are convinced that those aspirations will be achieved if mediation and other peaceful means of solving disputes  among other strategies  are adopted — and not just among nations  but among individuals and internally within countries.   Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to working with regional partners  the United Nations and other actors to promote global peace. We must strengthen our capacity to use mediation  complemented by the introduction of new approaches to Government and governance  such as the greater participation of women and a desire to build consensus.  We believe that unless leaders listen more  unless we employ mediation to resolve disputes  unless we incorporate our disenfranchised women in governance  unless we listen to the real message of today about greater participation in governance  and unless we realize that humankind has common challenges as it addresses issues like climate change  then the world will have missed a golden opportunity to advance the cause of humankind and promote global peace.  Let us therefore endeavour to resolve our common global challenges  for to do otherwise would be to fail succeeding generations of humankind  for which we who meet here today will never be forgiven nor forgotten."
"174",6969,"TUN",66,2011,"First  I would like to extend to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser and our brotherly country  Qatar  my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the    11-51390 24  General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are deeply confident that he will contribute actively to the success of its work. I would also like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his laudable and tireless efforts as President at the preceding session of the Assembly.   I take this opportunity to again congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second term. We are ready and determined to provide all possible support to ensure the success of the plan  to be announced in the coming weeks  detailing his vision of the priorities of the Organization over the next five years.  On behalf of my country  Tunisia  I would like also to welcome the sisterly Republic of South Sudan to the United Nations and wish the new State prosperity and progress and its leaders great success in their noble mission.  Allow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to the memory of the martyrs and youths of Tunisia’s valid and peaceful revolution  a revolution for freedom and dignity that brought the Arab Spring to the world. This historic event infused new hope into the conscience of humankind  which yearns for justice and democracy and places the highest value on freedom and human rights.  This spontaneous revolution — which had no real political or ideological leadership and did not involve any foreign intervention — has indeed succeeded in putting an end to one of the most dictatorial regimes in our region. The revolution exposed its practices and those of similar regimes  which in their hysterical lust for power blocked all political views  stifled freedom of expression and deprived young people of their hope for a better future  self-fulfilment and effective participation in political  economic and social life.  What happened in Tunisia is but the natural outgrowth of decades of tension and frustration. At the same time  it expressed the aspirations of its people to live in dignity and freedom. It was a decisive turning point in the country’s history that enabled us to regain our natural place in the community of nations and powers. It exemplified the strength of the common human values of freedom  democracy  tolerance  equal opportunities and respect for human rights  in all of their aspects.  Today  having removed all obstacles to its political  economic  social and cultural progress  Tunisia is at a turning point in its history and is on the threshold of a new stage. It yearns for the establishment of a genuine democracy  founded on strong guarantees that uphold the people’s sovereignty and enable them to exercise their rights and determine their destiny in a political system that is truly pluralistic and that enjoys peaceful transition of power  in accordance with the objectives of the glorious revolution and the faithful memories of our brave martyrs.  In seeking to achieve the goals of the revolution  the provisional Tunisian Government has made every effort to preserve all mechanisms needed to restore stability and security in the country  ensure the continuity of the State and its institutions and protect the interests of all segments of society.   We have therefore created the Higher Authority for the Protection of the Revolution  Political Reform and Democratic Transition. It brings together a range of political views and orientations  as well as representatives of civil society and national organizations. It has been entrusted with drawing up a road map to ensure a successful transitional period in a consensus-based and harmonious atmosphere.  The work of the Higher Authority  along with the consultations it held with the various national parties  resulted in a balanced and integrated plan of action from the legal and practical perspectives. This strategy will map out Tunisia’s political future in accordance with the aspirations of its people for a democratic  peaceful and quiet transition.  The main features of this strategy were evidenced in the interim President’s decision to suspend the Tunisian Constitution  dissolve the two chambers of Parliament and establish a provisional public administration comprised of an interim President and a provisional Government. This Government  whose competence and integrity are well known  will be responsible for running national affairs until a national constituent assembly is elected. The latter will draft a new constitution and establish a legal framework for the upcoming transitional period and thereby gain credibility in the eyes of the people.  Important strides have thus been made in preparations for the national constituent assembly elections  to be held on 23 October. We will spare no   25 11-51390  effort to enable the Tunisian people to elect their representatives in a popular  free  pluralistic  transparent and fair fashion.  We have established an independent higher national authority to monitor the various stages of the electoral process and have endowed it with the necessary legal foundations and financial support so that it can fulfil its mission independently and effectively under the best possible conditions. This highlights the fairness of our national approach and the clear vision of the political actors involved.  In that respect  it is worth recalling that for the first time in its history  Tunisia has adopted by consensus the principle of mandatory parity in its voter registries. That will enable us to maximize the potential of Tunisian society  men and women alike  and to preserve the well-deserved position held so competently by women in the fabric of Tunisian society. My colleague  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands  made a comment in that regard a few minutes ago.   In parallel with the progress made in the political field  the provisional Government is pursuing its comprehensive reforms in all sectors and fields. Upholding human rights and protecting public freedoms are the Government’s highest priorities.  Tunisia believes deeply in the universal values of solidarity  justice and international cooperation. In that respect  we urgently appeal to the entire international community  including Governments  international and regional organizations and civil society activists  to lend their support to our country’s efforts to repatriate the assets stolen from the Tunisian people by the former President and all of his family members and in-laws. The Tunisian people have the right to those funds and are in urgent need of them during this critical period fraught with tremendous economic and social challenges.  Tunisia also calls on all States that have received requests for extradition of persons involved in those crimes to respond positively to those legitimate requests. That will allow Tunisian justice to hold accountable all those who committed crimes against the Tunisian people  within the framework of a fair trial that guarantees the rights of the defendant under Tunisian law and international instruments.  We thank the friendly  kindred countries that have responded favourably to those requests. We hope that all States will efficiently and swiftly respond to Tunisia’s requests  pursuant to the noble principles of international cooperation and solidarity and to ensure that the values of justice  equality and fairness before the law will be respected by all.  The Government of Tunisia  with the support of national and international economic actors  has responded to the challenges generated by the delicate post-revolutionary situation  including its negative effects on our national economy. Humanitarian and economic conditions related to the crisis in sisterly Libya have further complicated the situation and hampered our Government’s task. Creating jobs  reducing the unemployment rate and eliminating social and economic disparities have become major challenges of the country.  Tunisia has been endowed with many national assets that will enable us to achieve our goals. We face numerous challenges in our endeavours for a democratic transition and for economic and social development  including the economic recession  which is apparent in certain areas. Therefore our country remains in need of continuous support and assistance from the international community.  I would like to seize this opportunity to convey my special thanks to the Group of Eight and the international and regional financial institutions that did not hesitate to support Tunisia’s democratic transition and economic revival processes  especially within the framework of the Deauville Partnership. I would also like to thank United Nations bodies  regional groups and friendly and sisterly countries for their precious contributions  whether in assisting the successful democratic transition or reducing the impact of the economic crisis in Tunisia and its social repercussions.   I also welcome the seminal efforts of States and organizations alike for their assistance in responding to the massive influx of hundreds of thousands refugees into Tunisia following the events that occurred in kindred Libya. Tunisia’s deep integration into its regional and international surroundings is a top priority for our foreign policy  which we are keen to develop through good relations with all States and organizations  based on cooperation  mutual respect  good-neighbourliness and respect for common interests.    11-51390 26   Tunisia considers relations with its immediate neighbours — the countries of the Arab Maghreb Union — especially important. We reiterate our call for resumed coordination among all of the Union’s member States to initiate a new phase of promoting integration through the establishment of durable and joint institutions  mainly in development and the economy  for the benefit of all of the peoples of our region.  In speaking of our Maghreb region  I take the opportunity to pay tribute also to the kindred Libyan people and to reiterate the warm respect and congratulations of the Tunisian people for their victorious revolution. It represents a crucial  historic change in the region that will pave the way for the emergence of a democratic political system in Libya. Those developments will have a profound  positive impact on Tunisian-Libyan relations and on the establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union.  As an Arab  Islamic and African country  Tunisia remains proud and deeply attached to its various origins. It will continue to support the political and regional organizations and groupings of which it is a member  as well as its economic and development partnerships.  Tunisia will remain faithful to mutual action within the Arab forum and to supporting the issues of concern to the League of Arab States  including the cause of Palestine.   Tunisia reaffirms its unwavering and principled position in support for its Palestinian brothers and sisters and for their request for full recognition as a State Member of the United Nations  as expressed by the President of the Palestinian Authority  Mr. Mahmoud Abbas  before the Assembly this past Friday (see ). Tunisia thus calls on the international community to support the legitimate Palestinian bid for full membership in the United Nations  as well as its territorial integrity as an independent State within legally recognized borders  with the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital. At the same time  Tunisia strongly condemns the unjust embargo imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and its recent military aggression there  which resulted in many innocent victims.   While congratulating the kindred Egyptian people for their young peoples’ successful revolution based on their legitimate aspirations for freedom and dignity  Tunisia expresses its hope that peace and stability will be restored in Syria and Yemen in order to meet the aspirations of their peoples for democracy  freedom and reforms. In parallel  Tunisia reaffirms its rejection of any attempt to exploit the situation in those two friendly countries. Tunisia reiterates its call to end the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the remaining occupied Lebanese territories  in accordance with international law.  As an African country  Tunisia attaches particular importance to its geographic position in the continent and to its belief in the importance of geographic integration and strengthened cooperation and solidarity with the sisterly African countries. Tunisia remains faithful to enhancing this belief while reaffirming respect for the principles and objectives of the African Union and its unwavering support for all initiatives aimed at promoting development in the continent and preserving its peace and stability and its capabilities.  Given the strategic importance of its relations with the European Union  Tunisia will further enhance those relations with an eye to establishing a closely knit partnership based on mutual respect and common interests. Here  Tunisia expresses its hope that the European Union and all of the friendly European countries will be among the first to support the Tunisian people and to assist them in the successful implementation of their transitional phase in the political  financial and economical sectors.   Tunisia will also strengthen cooperation in its relations with the countries and the peoples of the Mediterranean under the Union for the Mediterranean.   Our country attaches a particular importance also to fostering its relations with Australia  Latin American and the Asian countries  as well as with their major regional groups  within the framework of an open and balanced foreign policy approach aimed at establishing a multifaceted partnership.  Tunisia will strive to re-establish its position within the United Nations in a way that reflects its peoples’ awareness and aspirations as well as its rich history and positive contributions in its international relations. In that context  we highlight our commitment to the principles of international law and international legitimacy and call for launching the process of reforming the United Nations  mainly through enlargement of the Security Council’s membership in   27 11-51390  order to ensure permanent representation of the African continent.  Tunisia’s provisional Government welcomed the convening by the General Assembly  in July 2011  of the High-level Meeting on Youth and its outcome document (resolution 65/312)  which contains important recommendations reflecting the aspirations of young people throughout the world and based on the awareness that unemployment had become a universal phenomenon and thus one of the major challenges. We reiterate our call to all concerned parties to develop a global strategy to fight unemployment.  While organizing the elections to the National Constituent Assembly next October is a priority for our country  we reiterate our adherence to regional and international commitments and responsibilities. We reaffirm our work  as a peace-loving country  for international legality and to uphold the principles and values of the United Nations. We are determined to play an active and vital role in international relations  in line with the aspirations of our people  who have conducted a peaceful revolution to recover their rights  freedom and dignity."
"175",7016,"TUR",66,2011,"I extend my warm and respectful greetings to all  and hope that the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly will yield fruitful results. I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency  and extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his service as the previous President of the Assembly.  We are at a moment when both the international community and the United Nations are being tested in an unprecedented manner. I feel obliged  however  to state very frankly that today the United Nations is not demonstrating the leadership necessary to help humankind overcome its fears of the future. The United Nations must therefore reform itself and renew its vision with a view to protecting the universal rights of humankind as a whole  rather than act in the interest and remain under the guardianship of certain countries.  Last month in Somalia  for instance  I personally witnessed how the United Nations and the international community remain helpless in the face of today’s pressing problems. It is impossible for me to put into words the poverty and suffering I saw in Somalia. I am speaking of this because I have personally witnessed it  with my family and ministers. It is not hearsay; I have seen it myself. The tragedy of Somalia  where tens of thousands of children have died for the lack of a mere piece of bread and drop of water  is a matter of shame for the international community and cannot be dismissed in a few words. The civil war that has gone on for the past 20 years has wiped out all of Somalia’s resources and livelihood. The Somali people are being gradually dragged to their death as the world looks on.  The international community is watching the suffering in Somalia as if it were a movie. It is urgent  however  that we face this situation  which is a test of our humanity. In doing so  we should not only look at the picture we see today  but also at the shameful history that has led Somalia into this great tragedy. Indeed  beneath the tip of this huge iceberg lie great crimes against humanity.  In that respect  the situation in Somalia has also revealed the deep wounds inflicted by the colonialist mentality that kept Africa under its hegemony for centuries. Today  however  this cold colonial attitude stands aloof from places where it has no interest  and is watches idly as millions of children die for want of a morsel of bread in Somalia. I will be frank. No one can speak of peace  justice or civilization in the world if the cry rising from Somalia is left unheard. No words are sufficient to describe the agony there.  Turkey’s approach to Somalia or any other international issue is firmly grounded on humanitarian principles  which is why we have launched a   31 11-50865  comprehensive aid campaign for Somalia with the strong support of our nation. We have collected donations from our people of about $300 million within the past two months; moreover  our humanitarian assistance to date totals more than $30 million. We also organized an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul  at which pledges exceeded $350 million.  Along with emergency humanitarian aid  Turkey is also determined to help build the infrastructure and facilities that will enable Somalia to stand on its own feet. In that regard  Turkey has undertaken a wide range of projects  from transportation to health and education  and from agriculture to fisheries and construction  including roads  hospitals  schools and water wells. By reopening our embassy in Mogadishu  we have also shown the world that claims of security problems cannot be an excuse for delaying assistance.  Along with such measures  it is also essential that we bring an end to the civil war as quickly as possible and provide Somalia with democratic and unified governance in order to succeed in the fight against the piracy and terrorism originating there. In that regard  we would ask everyone to consider why the international community refuses to bestow on Somalia the attention it has given to conflict areas elsewhere in the world. The entire international community must act with a sense of utmost urgency in support of the efforts to build peace and stability in Somalia. The civil war that has suffocated our Somali brothers for 20 years must end without further delay.  In that context  the recent progress made by Somali leaders towards building a national consensus gives us hope for the future. As Somalia resumes its well-deserved place within the international community  the world will become a safer and more stable place. It is precisely this understanding that lies at the heart of Turkey’s determined efforts to help Somalia. We are making every attempt to implement infrastructure investments that will enable Somalia to stand on its feet  and working unrelentingly to help establish an environment of political stability and peace conducive to sustainable development. We are doing this solely because it is our humanitarian responsibility  and with no other motive. It is our greatest hope that the leadership demonstrated by Turkey in this area will set an example for the entire international community.  For us  the United Nations symbolizes the ideal that international law and justice shall prevail over sheer force and oppression  that peace shall prevail over conflict  and that the conscience of humanity shall prevail over narrow self-interest and political equilibrium. That is what I understand the United Nations to be.  The greatest impediment to the realization of this ideal is the Arab-Israel conflict  which has been ongoing for more than half a century. The fact that this problem is still not resolved and that rights  law and justice have been sacrificed for the sake of political balance is the greatest blow to the our sense of international justice.   To date  Israel has not complied with — and I emphasize this number — 89 binding resolutions of the Security Council. In addition  there are hundreds of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly — this very body — that Israel has ignored. Even more regrettable is the fact that the United Nations has been helpless to take a single step to end the human tragedy suffered by the Palestinian people.   Therefore  I must ask is whether the United Nations will fail to implement the sanctions it has imposed on other countries just as it has failed to implement its resolutions concerning Israel. Will the United Nations assiduously follow through on the resolutions it has taken with regard to other places  for example  the Sudan? We really do need to look at ourselves in the mirror.  This situation causes great indignation in the international community in general. Therefore  it cannot remain unresolved; the international community must act urgently to heal this bleeding wound.   Israel readily uses phosphate bombs and possesses the atom bomb  and has endured no sanctions. But if even the hint of such a possibility emerges elsewhere in the region  efforts are made to suppress it. I ask whether that is fair and just.   To be frank  the problem in this context is caused by the Israeli Government. Those who govern the country take steps every day that  instead of paving the way for peace  build new barriers to it. Thus  it is the Palestinian territories that are under occupation  not Israeli territory. It is a contradiction of history to say that it the occupied lands are Israeli territory. It is Palestinian territory that is under occupation. It is    11-50865 32  Israel that uses disproportionate force. Once again  it is Israel that does not abide by international will.  In this context  the illegal settlements that are still being established in the occupied territories of Palestine  despite the calls of the international community to stop  as well as the blockade on Gaza  stand out in particular.   I ask the Assembly; Does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights allow for a country  society or people to be cut off from international justice? In my copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  I do not see such a possibility. If you want to send a box of tomatoes to Palestine  you must get permission from Israel  and I do not think that is humane.   As I have stated before  those who govern Israel must make a choice. Loopholes in the United Nations system and lobbies in some countries may give Israel the opportunity to evade international law and justice as it pursues its illegitimate actions. However  that will not ensure — and I say this with emphasis — the security that Israel needs today.   Those who govern Israel must see that real security is possible only by building real peace. I would like once again to remind Israel from this rostrum that nothing can substitute for peace. What we face today is not a simple equation of peace for security. Israel must read the newly flourishing political and social landscape in the Middle East and understand that it will no longer be possible to carry on in environment of continuous strife and conflict.   If we  as the international community  believe that the ideal of establishing international peace and security is the founding principle of the United Nations  then it is time pressure Israel to achieve peace  despite the actions of its leaders  and to show it clearly that it is not above the law.   One of the most important steps that need to be taken in this regard is responding to the legitimate demands of the Palestinian people to be recognized as a State and to have the representatives of the State of Palestine take their well-deserved place in this Assembly as a Member of the United Nations. Indeed  in 1947 the United Nations  through resolution 181 (II)  declared Palestine a State  but unfortunately that resolution was not implemented.   Turkey’s support for the recognition of the State of Palestine is unconditional. Turkey will continue to work actively in the Middle East to ensure peace. We stand ready to do so. Accordingly  we will continue to work actively for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict  the recognition of the State of Palestine  the achievement of unity among Palestinians  and the lifting of the illegal blockade enforced against the people of Gaza.   This commitment is a natural extension of our vision for regional peace and stability and our commitment to international law and justice. It is also the result of the responsibility we feel in this area. Similarly  when a humanitarian aid convoy of participants from 33 countries was attacked by air and sea in international waters  resulting in the deaths of nine innocent civilians  we could not remain silent. Our reaction to Israel was a manifestation of our conviction.   Turkey has never pursued hostile and confrontational policies against any State. Our foreign policy is based on the principles of friendship and cooperation. Our policy towards Israel is no exception to these principles. However  Israel has seriously wronged a country and its people who have through history shown great friendship to it and its people. What we demand of Israel is clear. Israel must apologize  pay compensation to the families of our martyrs and lift the blockade on Gaza. Until Israel meets these demands and takes steps in this direction  our position will not change.   Let me also emphasize from this rostrum that we do not have a problem with the people of Israel. Our problem arises from the aggressive policies of the current Israeli Government. In fact  we have had very constructive relations with previous Israeli Governments  making great strides in a number of areas. Currently  the source of tension is solely the Israeli Government.   Turkey is a country that is trustworthy in the international arena and whose friendship and cooperation are sought. We will not abandon this principled and determined policy.  We are witnessing a historic process of transformation and change in the Middle East. From the very first day when these events began  we appealed to all administrations in the region to lend an ear to the calls of their people for democracy. The   33 11-50865  ultimate source of legitimacy for every Government is  above all  the people and its will. What needs to be done is to ensure that the people’s will is realized in a free and open manner.  We have also said that sovereignty derives from the will of the people. Any sovereignty that does not rest on the will of the people is not legitimate. Sovereignty does not allow any leader or any regime to repress its own people or kill innocent civilians. A regime that points guns at its own people can have no sovereignty or legitimacy. Today  everyone must understand that times have changed. The era of Governments that do not meet the legitimate needs and expectations of their people and of administrations that oppress and repress their people and fail to give the highest priority to justice has come to an end.   This was the call we made. We are very pleased to see that our calls have been heeded in Egypt  Tunisia and Libya and have paved the way for democratic transformation and transition on the basis of the legitimate demands of the people in those countries. This gives us hope for the future. We observe with regret  however  that some countries continue to stay behind the curve of events and react with misguided reflexes owing to their outdated state of mind.   In that context  we are very closely following the developments unfolding in Syria  which is our neighbour and therefore very important to Turkey. The current situation in Syria gives us great cause for concern. The actions of the Government are unacceptable and we have warned the Syrian leadership many times to that effect. We share a 910-kilometre border. We have ties and relatives on both sides of the border. We have always spoken the truth  because we believe that friends always speak the truth  no matter how bitter. We have always stated that the voices  demands and wishes of the people must be heard. We have said that persecution and oppression cannot generate prosperity. We must listen to the call of the people for democracy  not point guns at them.   Unfortunately  the Syrian leadership has persistently ignored our warnings. Now  every drop of blood spilled in the country only widens and deepens the divide between the people and the administration of Syria. Turkey will continue to support the legitimate and democratic demands of the people of Syria and elsewhere  and to call on regimes to respect the wishes and expectations of their people. We expect the international community to do the same.   In that regard  we are increasing our cooperation with Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya  Turkey has supported the National Transitional Council from the very beginning. We are very proud to announce that we were the first country to restore its Ambassador to Libya. We will continue to staunchly support the new Libya as it resumes its well-deserved place in the United Nations as a democratic  united and independent State.   During my visit to Libya last week  I went to Tripoli  Tajura  Misurata and Benghazi  holding meetings in all four cities. I met and spoke with the people. I saw and sensed the righteous pride of the Libyan people in their revolution. I also witnessed the destruction in Misurata.   I believe that the international community must be very sensitive to certain issues in terms of Libya. First  Libya and its resources belong to the Libyans. As democracy is established in Libya  it is very important that the country’s frozen assets abroad be released immediately so that Libya can stand on its own two feet. We want to ensure that the Libyans have the resources they really need. Currently  the country has $170 billion in assets abroad  but the people cannot benefit from them. In that regard  it is essential to implement resolution 2009 (2011). The Libyan people can determine their own future and we must respect their choices.   A fair  comprehensive and lasting solution must be found to the long-standing problem in Cyprus  which has persisted for more than half a century. The United Nations plan put forward in 2004 demonstrated that the parameters of a solution are there  but that the Greek Cypriot side lacks the necessary will to make it a reality. The Turkish Cypriot side  however  has still not been freed from the isolation imposed upon it  even though it has always expressed its full determination to find a solution. Nevertheless  the Turkish Cypriot side has remained committed to a peaceful solution and has participated with goodwill in the negotiations resumed under United Nations auspices.   The objective is to finalize the negotiations by the end of this year and have the settlement plan endorsed in simultaneous referendums early next year  thus enabling a united new Cyprus to take its place in the European Union without further delay. Turkey will    11-50865 34  continue to provide all necessary support so as to reach a solution as soon as possible  in line with that timetable. I wish to emphasize  however  that if the intransigent attitude of the Greek Cypriot side does not permit this to happen  as a guarantor country we will not let the future of the Turkish Cypriots remain uncertain forever.   Moreover  at this critical juncture  we cannot accept any attempt by the Greek Cypriot side to act as if it were the sole representative of the Island or had the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Turkish Cypriots. In that regard  the attempts of the Greek Cypriot side to unilaterally determine maritime jurisdiction areas and to engage in exploration activities in oil and natural gas fields are extremely irresponsible in terms of both timing and possible outcomes.   In the face of these unilateral activities of the Greek Cypriot side  which appear to be aimed at provoking a crisis  Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side will act with common sense  but also will resolutely protect their rights under international law. At this point  we expect all concerned parties to work actively to ensure that the Greek Cypriot Administration halts these activities  which could lead to tension  not only on the Island  but also throughout the region. Otherwise  we will do whatever is necessary.   The illegitimate occupation of Azerbaijani territories  which has been ongoing for many years  must come to an end. It is unacceptable to allow the Nagorny Karabakh conflict to remain unresolved to the extent that it is today.   All of us bear political and moral responsibility for resolving international problems before they lead to stalemates. In that respect  more effective efforts must be made to peacefully resolve the Kashmir conflict and many other frozen disputes  which I will not enumerate here. Conversely  peace and stability in the Balkans can be achieved with the recognition of Kosovo’s independence.   Turkey has always been a staunch supporter of the principles and goals enshrined in the Charter of the   United Nations. I believe that we showed our commitment in that respect during our tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2009-2010. I also believe that our effective performance at that time attests to what we intend to do if re-elected to the Security Council for 2015-2016. In this regard  I to take this opportunity to reaffirm that we count on the support of all the Members of the General Assembly for Turkey’s candidacy to a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the term 2015-2016.  As yet another manifestation of our support for the goals of the United Nations  we are also determined to pursue the Istanbul Programme of Action adopted at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which Turkey hosted early this year. We are also continuing our efforts to implement as soon as possible the announced package of economic and technical cooperation for the least developed countries. As part of that package  which includes many areas of cooperation ranging from trade to education and agriculture to energy  we intend to provide the least developed countries with annual assistance of $200 million. We also envisage increasing our direct investments in these countries to $5 billion and $12 billion by 2015 and 2020  respectively.  We consider security  development and respect for human rights to be integral parts of the same whole. Together  they constitute the most fundamental guarantee of lasting peace. Turkey will continue to work towards the attainment of these fundamental objectives of the United Nations and make every effort to leave future generations a safer and more prosperous world."
"176",7032,"TUV",66,2011,"As this is the first time I have stood at this rostrum as Prime Minister of Tuvalu and participated in the general debate of the General Assembly  I am delighted to convey the warmest greetings and best wishes of my people and my Government  and I am honoured to speak today on their behalf. Let me first extend my special thanks and sincere appreciation to the Government of the United States of America  as the host country  for the warm hospitality and special protocols accorded to my delegation since our arrival.  Ten years ago  Tuvalu established and opened its Permanent Mission to the United Nations here in New York  with a mandate to engage more closely with nations of the global family. Despite our limited resources as one of the smallest Member States  our presence is a simple testimony of our hope and trust in collaboration with Member States in the pursuit of our destiny. This further reflects our continued commitment to uphold the maintenance of international peace and security  development and human rights as fundamental pillars of the United Nations  as enshrined in its Charter.  Tuvalu warmly welcomes and fully supports the four main areas of focus of Mr. Al-Nasser’s presidency  including the peaceful settlement of disputes  United Nations reform and revitalization  improving disaster prevention and response  and sustainable development and global prosperity  which he clearly identified during the opening of the session. In particular  the theme that he proposed for the general debate — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” — is timely  considering what is happening around the world today.  In this context  I wish to express our belated tribute and respect to the people and the Government of the United States in commemoration of the recent tenth anniversary of the events of 11 September 2001. Tuvalu strongly condemns such terrorist acts and all similar incidents worldwide  and our prayers are with those who have lost their loved ones. Tuvalu further salutes those who have lost their lives for the cause of justice and peace.  As a peace-loving nation  Tuvalu fully supports the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace and security across the globe. However  at the same time  the integrity and sovereignty of countries should be respected at all costs. Tuvalu firmly believes that military and violent action should not be used as a means for the settlement of disputes. Instead  the parties concerned should be encouraged to discuss and understand the root causes of their differences and try to listen to each other in a more peaceful manner.  Today the world is undergoing profound changes without any boundaries through the unprecedented impacts of globalization and other related global events  which have critical implications for Tuvalu. This has been further exacerbated by the continued severe impact of the global financial and economic crisis  which has had an enormous and critical negative effect on Tuvalu’s economy. In particular  the Tuvalu Trust Fund  which is the main source of revenue to stabilize our recurrent budget  has been severely affected. As a consequence  my Government has no other option apart from streamlining and containing its national recurrent budget to a sustainable level so as to   15 11-51360  enable the provision of basic services to its people during these difficult times.  In this regard  I humbly call upon the international community and development partners to urgently fulfil their commitments to assist the least developed countries (LDCs)  including Tuvalu  through the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action  adopted at the fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Turkey earlier this year. The Istanbul Programme of Action is a living document that needs to be implemented vigorously and collectively by LDCs and the international community during the next 10 years. In that regard  I am pleased to confirm that the main thrusts of that Programme of Action will be integrated and mainstreamed in the Tuvalu National Sustainable Development Strategy  during the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries scheduled for next month.  Furthermore  as a least developed country  Tuvalu is most vulnerable to global economic shocks  the impacts of climate change and outbreaks of disease  including non-communicable diseases. Tuvalu continues to call on and appeal to the United Nations to take those vulnerabilities seriously into consideration when addressing the question of the graduation of LDCs. Despite the ambitious target of the Istanbul Programme of Action for 50 per cent of LDCs to be graduated within the next decade  Tuvalu firmly believes that its economic and environmental vulnerability  coupled with its continuous dependence on official development assistance  cannot be totally ignored. In that context  the graduation criteria need to be reviewed to reflect and recognize our vulnerability.  Last month  Tuvalu published its second Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Progress Report covering the period from 2010 to 2011  which highlights the progress we have made to date towards achieving those goals. Despite the ongoing impact of recent global crises  which Tuvalu continues to face  it is encouraging to note that five of the MDGs are likely to be achieved and three will have mixed results by 2015. As alluded to earlier  while we have made progress in achieving the MDGs  such progress can be reversed overnight because of our particular economic and environmental vulnerability.  The ongoing process and inter-governmental negotiations at the United Nations to revitalize and reform the General Assembly and the Security Council respectively are fully supported. However  while we recognize the importance of the reforms being undertaken by those United Nations bodies in order to update their mandates  we are concerned that the time taken to conclude such undertakings is far too long. In that regard  we look forward to a more realistic timetable to complete those negotiations in the near future  once and for all.  Our collective efforts to strengthen and maintain peace across the globe will be meaningless  if the United Nations continues to turn blind eyes and deaf ears to Taiwan’s contribution and efforts toward those common goals. Furthermore  Taiwan’s continued contribution to the international community as one of the committed development partners cannot be overemphasized. In that regard  Tuvalu strongly urges the United Nations to recognize those contributions without any reservations. In particular  Tuvalu calls upon the United Nations subsidiary bodies  especially the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization  to allow Taiwan to participate fully and meaningfully in their meetings and activities  including in United Nations meetings on climate change.  Climate change is a priority global issue of the twenty-first century and beyond and therefore requires a global solution. Climate change impacts countries unequally and not all countries possess the same capacity and resilience to adapt and respond to such impacts. For a small island developing State like Tuvalu  climate change is without a doubt a security issue that threatens our survival. At the end of this year parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be meeting in Durban to advance our work on climate change. It will be a critical meeting  as time is fast running out for highly vulnerable countries like Tuvalu. My country believes the meeting in Durban must deliver key outcomes.  First  we must adopt amendments to the Kyoto Protocol  so as to allow for a second commitment period. It will be necessary to adopt a decision that includes provisional entry into force of those amendments to avoid any gap between the first and second commitment periods. That is necessary in order to ensure that the clean development mechanism continues without any complications and that the mechanism continues to provide financing for the Adaptation Fund.    11-51360 16   Secondly  we must make rapid progress in developing an international mechanism to address loss and damage. For highly vulnerable countries like Tuvalu  that is vitally important. We need an international mechanism to spread the burden of rebuilding after major weather catastrophes. Thirdly  we must re-focus our work on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. To properly reduce global deforestation we must put in place appropriate measures that effectively address its causes. We must look at this from the demand side and explore all means of regulating the trade in products that is driving deforestation.  Finally  we believe that all major emitting countries must take more decisive action to reduce their emissions. The current pledging system found in the Cancún Agreements is inadequate. We will be seeking a mandate in Durban to commence negotiations on a new  legally binding agreement for those major emitting countries that have not taken commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. That agreement should complement the Kyoto Protocol  but not replace it.   As we make progress towards the Rio+20 Conference next year  we must ensure that there is a focused section dealing with the needs of small island developing States. In considering the theme of the green economy  we must explore carefully how we can redirect the current international trading system to properly reflect the needs of small island economies. We need accessible and affordable technologies that take advantage of renewable energy and energy efficiency  we need help to protect our blue economies and our oceans  and we need to explore new preferential trade arrangements to overcome our size disadvantage.  In conclusion  let me reiterate the severe impact of the recent financial and economic crisis and other ongoing global crises  which continue to affect my country’s economy and its overall social and economic development. As a small island developing State and a least developed country  vulnerable to such crises and dependent on overseas development assistance  Tuvalu appeals to the international community to urgently honour and fulfil their commitments and obligations outlined in the Istanbul Programme of Action and other international platforms. We firmly believe that with our continued cooperation and strong partnerships at all levels  we can successfully overcome those problems for the sake of our people and humankind."
"177",7078,"TZA",66,2011,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation has full confidence in you  and we assure you of our full support and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for very ably steering the affairs of the sixty-fifth session. A lot has been achieved  which  I have no doubt  you will consolidate and advance.  Allow me also to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt congratulations to our illustrious Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon  on his well-deserved second mandate. His reappointment reaffirms the trust that we have in him and in his leadership skills. It is also recognition of his dedicated service to the United Nations and humankind as a whole.  Once again  I congratulate and welcome the newest member of the United Nations family  the Republic of South Sudan  and assure them of Tanzania’s continued friendship and cooperation.  This year the United Republic of Tanzania  which is a union between two sovereign States — the People’s Republic of Zanzibar and the Republic of Tanganyika — will celebrate 50 years of the independence of Tanganyika. We will also celebrate 50 years of our membership in the United Nations. I stand before the Assembly today  50 years later  to reiterate that same faith in  and that same commitment to  the United Nations as expressed by the founders of our dear nation. I am proud that Tanzania has remained faithful to the ideals of the United Nations  and is a proactive Member of this body. We promise to stay the course for the next 50 years and beyond.  The people of Tanzania are happy to have had the opportunity to contribute to maintaining peace and security in Africa and other parts of the world. We have always believed that mediation  conflict prevention and pacific settlement of disputes are the best means of resolving conflicts. As a result  Tanzania has been in the forefront of mediation efforts to resolve conflicts in the countries around us  in our region and elsewhere on the continent.  Our country also has been contributing troops  police  corrections officers and civilian personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions and through regional and sub-regional arrangements. We promise to continue to do so wherever and whenever asked. More important  we are humbled to have had the rare opportunity to pioneer the efforts  together with Denmark  that lead to the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission in 2006.  We are also proud to have had  in the 50 years of our membership in the United Nations  the opportunity to contribute to the decolonization of Africa and other parts of the world. At independence  the founding father of our nation  the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  said that the independence of our country was incomplete until all countries of Africa were free.   That guided Tanzania to strongly oppose all forms of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination on the African continent and elsewhere. It also informed our resolve to help our brothers and sisters who were fighting for their independence and freedom in Africa. We had the honour of hosting the headquarters of the African Liberation Committee in Dar-es-Salaam until colonialism  apartheid and minority rule had been dismantled.    5 11-50865   We gave sanctuary as well as moral and material support to almost all the liberation movements of Southern Africa. Here at the United Nations  Tanzania was afforded the rare honour of chairing the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization from 1972 to 1980. That was the critical phase in the decolonization of Africa and in the struggle against apartheid and minority rule. It is heart-warming indeed to see our efforts  sacrifices and contributions being rewarded so handsomely with the independence of all African countries and with apartheid having been dismantled in South Africa.   Only Western Sahara remains outstanding. I hope the United Nations will expedite the process so that the Saharawi people can determine their future peacefully.  We believed at independence  as we believe now and always will believe  that all human beings are born equal and deserve equal protection of their civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights  as outlined in what has come to be known as the International Bill of Rights. This guides what we are doing at home  with regard to promoting democracy  the rule of law  human rights  including personal freedoms  among them the freedom of expression.  It is in this spirit also that I wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the Palestinian people in their rightful quest for an independent homeland. Our plea is for the fulfilment of the vision of two States: the State of Israel and a sovereign  independent  democratic and viable State of Palestine  living side by side in peace and harmony. That is why we also remain in full solidarity with the people of Cuba in demanding the end to the embargo. It is perhaps the longest-lasting embargo in history. The people in these three countries — Israel  Palestine and Cuba — have suffered for far too long. It is time their burdens are eased.  Our other goal was and still is the attainment of African unity. We believe in the strength of unity for us to be able to effectively face up to and overcome the daunting political  security and development challenges facing our continent. It was in pursuit of this ideal that on 26 April 1964  Zanzibar and Tanganyika merged to form the United Republic of Tanzania. We will never tire in our efforts towards the realization of the dream of the founding fathers of a United States of Africa. However  we are mindful of the fact that this will be a gradual process and regional economic integration and regional groupings will be its foundation and the building blocks.  After 50 years of independence and 50 years of our membership of the United Nations  Tanzania remains a firm believer in the indispensability of multilateralism. It is through multilateralism that we can bring all nations and therefore all peoples together to shape their common present and future and that of the world they live in. It is through multilateralism that peace and development will be guaranteed for all nations  through the pursuit of common values. It is for these reasons that I believe the United Nations is relevant today  as it was 66 years ago. It is for the same reasons that the world needs the other multilateral institutions for global economic  social and political governance.  Despite acknowledging the importance of various multilateral institutions  Tanzania is of the view that they need to undergo serious reforms to overcome the serious governance deficits within them. We need reforms that will make them more representative — in particular  reforms that will increase the voices of the developing countries. The original structures have ignored us. We should not allow this to continue. It is for this reason that Tanzania supported the calls for reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions  the United Nations  the World Trade Organization and the other multilateral institutions.   With regard to the United Nations  we should expedite the process of reforming the Security Council  in both categories  and in doing so include developing countries  particularly those from Africa  Asia and Latin America. It is sad to see that no serious progress has been made for close to two decades. Now is the time for us to start serious negotiations  negotiate in earnest and conclude at the earliest possible time.  Promoting development  particularly shared growth  has been one of the core functions of the United Nations. It is pleasing to note that the United Nations has remained steadfast in its discharge of this function through its agencies and through a number of initiatives undertaken by the United Nations Headquarters itself. United Nations leadership has always been noticeable in all the major socio-economic challenges facing the world: sustainable development  health care  maternal and child health  poverty  food security  education  and so on. This involvement and leadership underscores the relevance of the United    11-50865 6  Nations today and the United Nations tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.  However  the good intentions of the United Nations have not been fully realized. Some of the developed countries have not met their commitments of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official development assistance. Let me use this opportunity to join all those who have spoken before me in repeating our appeal to developed countries to honour their commitments.   I believe that if this had been done  we would have been on target with the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and many other important global matters. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank and commend those few developed countries that have kept their promise. May the examples of these countries inform and encourage the others to do the same.  We meet at a time of great uncertainties over the global economy. Economies are still weak  characterized by low growth in many major economies  high levels of inflation  unemployment  increasing food and fuel prices and nervous financial markets. In a globalized world  ripples of economic and financial crises in the developed economies affect all of us in the world. And for us from poor developing countries  matter get even more complicated.   As we all call for concerted global action to maintain economic stability and ensure that we do not head into another global recession  I appeal to the United Nations to remain seized of the situation and exercise its traditional leadership over global issues.   This is a matter of great concern to us in Africa  a continent that has experienced extremely challenging economic  social and political situations  but a continent that is now poised to go to the next level: from despair to hope and from lost decades to decades full of opportunities.   Democracy is steadily on the march in Africa and the Arab Spring has capped it all. Peace is reigning almost all over the continent. There are no serious conflict situations except for Somalia  where the serious involvement of the United Nations  the African Union and the world community is still needed. All that Africa needs now is continued support to build the institutions of democracy and governance  to build our economies and to overcome social challenges.   Among the challenges demanding the serious attention of this body and the international community at large is the continued drought in the Horn of Africa and some countries of East Africa. The problem has not abated and its consequences are momentous  as exemplified by the ongoing famine in Somalia. It is high time for more attention to be given to the situation in this part of Africa  for there is every indication and every reason to believe that the problem is escalating and involving more countries. Tanzania is already feeling the pressure of the crisis.  Piracy is the second problem in our part of the continent that I would like to mention here today. The problem of piracy still lingers on and it is  in fact  expanding. We are now witnessing more and more attacks taking place further to the south of Somalia. They used to take place in the Gulf of Aden  but now the attacks are moving southward  as far as Tanzania  Mozambique  the Comoros and Madagascar. Since last year  when piracy activity moved to our territorial waters  13 ships have been attacked and five of them were successfully hijacked. These attacks have caused an increase in the cost of shipping to our ports. If we do not succeed in stopping them  they may disrupt shipping services and impact negatively on our economy. We need the support of the international community to help us build capacity to fight piracy. We welcome the Assembly’s readiness to assist us to improve our courts and prisons to try and punish the pirates. But if a similar gesture were extended to us to build capacity to prevent attacks  there would be fewer pirates to bother us.  Controversies continue to prevent progress on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. The more we delay  the more sophisticated international terrorism becomes in its strategies and tactics. We recently witnessed events in Abuja in which the United Nations was attacked. Tanzania condemns these cruel acts in the strongest terms possible and expresses solidarity with the people of Nigeria and the United Nations. It is clear that the struggle against terrorism must remain a high priority for the United Nations.  I would be remiss if I concluded my statement without acknowledging and thanking the Secretary-General for the honour he accorded me and my country  Tanzania  last year when he formed a Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health. He appointed me and   7 11-50865  Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada to co-chair the Commission. It was an honour to serve on the Commission  and I hope that the recommendations we made will help to advance the cause of the noble work that we are all doing to save the lives of millions of innocent women and children who are dying from causes that can be prevented.   I end as I began  by reaffirming our faith in the United Nations  a true embodiment of humanity. We dedicate ourselves to respect the values and principles enshrined in our Charter and we shall continue to play — as we have always have done during our first 50 years as an independent State — a full  honest and constructive part in the work of the United Nations."
"178",7121,"UGA",66,2011,"Uganda joins other delegations in congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of this body. My delegation has confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his effective stewardship of the work of the General Assembly during the past session.  Uganda takes this opportunity to congratulate the Government and the people of South Sudan on attaining statehood and becoming the 193rd Member of the United Nations. Uganda also congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General.  The theme of this session’s general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is most appropriate in the light of the conflict situations in various parts of the world  including Africa. When actualized  the peaceful settlement of disputes saves lives and property that would otherwise be lost if force were used. Strategic interventions  such as mediation  are necessary to mitigate conflict situations and avert crises that threaten the stability not only of nations  but also of entire regions  with adverse effects on development and people’s livelihoods. Mediation is a necessary and essential tool for the peaceful resolution of conflicts  as it is aims to support disputing parties in the process of negotiating a mutual understanding or agreement.  Uganda has consistently advocated an enhanced role for subregional and regional organizations in conflict prevention and resolution. When those organizations are involved in mediating disputes  they play a critical role in bringing about sustainable peace and security. It was against this background that Uganda supported and sponsored resolution 65/283 on mediation as a tool for the peaceful settlement of disputes. The resolution provides a basis for consolidating normative mediation efforts  reinforcing mediation support activities and enhancing the role of Member States.  Uganda has been involved in various initiatives to bring peace to the Great Lakes region  the Horn of Africa and the African continent as a whole. Our involvement included participation in the Burundi peace process and in the negotiations  led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  on the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement  which culminated in the birth of a new nation  South Sudan  which is now participating as an equal partner in the community of nations.  In the case of Somalia  in addition to our contribution to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)  Uganda continues to support the engagement of the Somali Transitional Federal Government with other actors so as to promote dialogue in the context of the Djibouti Agreement and the Kampala Accord. In order to consolidate the gains realized on the ground  the United Nations and the rest of the international community must urgently strengthen support to Somalia by means of capacity-building for the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions; the deployment of the additional authorized 3 000 troops; the approval of a reliable and predictable funding mechanism and of the required aviation assets to AMISOM; and the provision of urgent humanitarian relief and assistance to meet the basic needs of the people through quick-impact projects in such areas as health care  water and sanitation.  Our experience in conflict prevention and resolution in Africa is that if such efforts are to succeed and be sustainable  a number of factors come into play. First  peace initiatives should be led by the region  with strong support from regional organizations  the United Nations and other relevant actors. Secondly  it is sometimes important to initially give priority to peace before justice in order to strengthen confidence-building between parties. Thirdly  peace and reconciliation mechanisms  including transitional all-inclusive administrations  need to be established to heal the wounds of conflict. Fourthly  post-conflict recovery and reconstruction programmes or projects should be instituted simultaneously so as to demonstrate the benefits of peace dividends.  Mediation is a worthwhile investment. It costs much less than other undertakings  such as peacekeeping or peace enforcement. In terms of benefits  effective mediation can avert unnecessary wars and their attendant consequences  such as the loss of life and property  and contribute to building capacity for home-grown solutions to address conflict. The mutual confidence that normally results from mediation between parties can also be instrumental in achieving inclusive political and other arrangements following the conclusion of peace agreements. Once   19 11-51384  achieved  such arrangements have a positive impact on the consolidation of peace and security  as well as on sustainable post-conflict reconstruction  recovery and development.  Uganda believes that potential differences between and within countries are better addressed using home-grown solutions. External influences or interventions do not necessarily offer sustainable solutions to conflict. On the contrary  the latter tend at times to contribute to a cycle of destabilizing tendencies.  It is therefore important that the involvement of the United Nations  the international community and other actors take full account of the interests and concerns of all parties. Hence  there is a need for close coordination  consultation and information-sharing with the parties concerned. The support of the international community should target areas mutually agreed upon with the parties concerned. It is also important to underscore the fact that  where potential conflict situations arise and external support becomes necessary  the international community should provide a timely  adequate and robust response.  It is equally necessary to build and strengthen the mediation capacities of subregional and regional organizations. Specifically  in the case of conflicts in Africa  our preferred solution is peaceful settlement through mediation  not military intervention. In the case of the Libyan crisis  the African Union (AU) has called upon the National Transitional Council to establish an all-inclusive transitional Government  as proposed in the AU road map for the peaceful resolution of the Libyan conflict.  Uganda would like to make a strong case to this Assembly that Africa should be given the chance to resolve its conflicts. Africa has strong political will to handle them  and any interventions should be aimed at supporting African initiatives to find peaceful solutions. It is therefore imperative that our partners recognize the existing dispute resolution mechanisms of the regional bodies in Africa. I also call upon the United Nations to fully support Africa in that regard.  Besides  the role of women in mediation must be appreciated and enhanced. Experience has shown that women can contribute a lot to efforts aimed at peaceful settlement of disputes and at conflict prevention and resolution. It is therefore vital that women become increasingly involved in mediation efforts and processes.  On the Israeli-Palestinian question  Uganda has consistently called upon the Israeli and the Palestinian parties to muster the necessary courage to negotiate and reach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State solution  that is  Israel and the State of Palestine living side by side peacefully and within secure borders. We urge both parties to urgently resume negotiations in order to reach a two-State solution that will guarantee durable peace.  The outcome of this debate should include practical and pragmatic actions to address some of the challenges relating to mediation. These include  but are not limited to  issues involved in the adequacy and predictability of the requisite resources  capacity-building at the national  subregional and regional levels  the involvement of women  and the strengthening of coordination and collaboration in mediation efforts and processes."
"179",7168,"UKR",66,2011,"I sincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am convinced that his considerable experience will contribute to the achievement of significant results on behalf of States Members of the United Nations and the entire Organization.  This year  the great family of States Members of the United Nations was enriched by a new 193rd Member. On behalf of Ukraine  I would like to express our support for the Government and people of South Sudan in the process of State-building  and to assure them of Ukraine’s readiness to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with a new member of the international community.  This is a special session given the number of high-level meetings devoted to issues of a global scale — nuclear safety and security  the prevention of non-communicable diseases  desertification and land degradation  racism and discrimination.  During this session  the delegation of Ukraine has actively participated in discussions on the issues that are most topical for our State — nuclear security and disease control. With regard to the theme of the general debate  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes”  I note that the issue of preventing armed conflict  and the loss of human lives and the suffering triggered by them  was one of the cornerstones of Ukraine’s first membership  as an independent State  of the Security Council in 2000-2001.  Preventive diplomacy and mediation at the regional and international levels  from the frozen conflicts in the post-Soviet space to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and the restoration of stability in North Africa  remain an integral part of Ukraine’s foreign policy. We pursue that policy in the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission  and will continue to do so during Ukraine’s presidency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2013.  Regrettably  conflict prevention efforts are often not effective enough  and conflict settlement takes too long. Our main duty in such cases is to save lives and to alleviate the fate of civilians who find themselves in danger. Ukraine will always provide help to those who suffer. In addition to humanitarian efforts  we are ready to support all constructive international peace initiatives and preventive measures.  We believe that  in armed confrontations  top priority must be given to respect for human rights  first of all by ensuring the safety of civilians. Guided by this principle  Ukraine was among the first to carry out a humanitarian mission in Libya at the beginning of this year. The Ukrainian amphibious landing ship Konstantin Olshansky was used to evacuate almost 200 citizens of 20 nationalities  more than half of them women and children  from the conflict zone.  Ukraine has just celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence. Today  we are assessing the road we have travelled and rethinking some important moments in our modern history in order to find effective solutions to the issues that have remained unresolved for many years. It is precisely for that purpose that I have initiated sweeping reforms in the country  aimed at social and economic transformations and at further strengthening the democratic system and the rule of law in Ukraine.   The foundations of all reform processes in Ukraine are the fundamental democratic values that Ukrainians share with other Europeans. That is why the guiding principles we have determined for the modernization of the country are directly related to the ambitious objectives contained in the future Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union.  The twentieth anniversary of our independence is only an instant in historical terms  yet the roots of our statehood can be traced back thousands of years. Since ancient times  Ukraine has been developing a European spirit and culture  while cherishing the traditions of tolerance and inter-ethnic and intercultural harmony in   5 11-50702  our society. We believe that straightforward and frank dialogue based on universal values is the only way to find a common language in each country and in international relations alike.  Ukraine’s position on the need to uphold human rights at all times and everywhere as the highest value has always been crystal clear. Examples of that commitment are seen in Ukraine’s activities during its two terms of membership in the Human Rights Council from June 2006 to June 2011. We will not lessen our attention to this subject and are planning to rejoin the Council in 2018.  As Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe from May to November this year  Ukraine is focused on the issues of children’s rights  the development of local self-governance and the rule of law. We are convinced that the rule of law and respect for human rights  as the bases for building a society  are needed to counter many contemporary threats  including the complex challenges of terrorism.  Recently  the world shuddered from the attack on the United Nations building in Nigeria  which offered yet further proof that the ugly face of terrorism is becoming more repulsive and brazen. The blow was struck directly against our Organization  which is of particular concern and requires increased security for United Nations premises.  As one of the State initiators of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel  and as a party to all universal anti-terrorist conventions currently in force  Ukraine resolutely condemns any manifestations of terrorism. We believe that all terrorist acts  regardless of who commits them and where or why they are committed  violate a fundamental human right — the right to life — and therefore constitute a crime against humanity. I pay tribute to the memory of those killed 10 years ago  on 11 September 2001  as well as to all other victims of terrorist attacks.  I am sincerely proud of the significant contribution of Ukraine to the peaceful coexistence of humankind. I refer not only to our voluntarily abandoning nuclear arms and large stockpiles of highly enriched uranium. The awareness of the global scale of the effects of the Chernobyl disaster was the impetus for my initiative to convene the Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy in April. The Summit enabled us to enhance international cooperation in strengthening nuclear safety and in responding adequately to accidents and emergencies. I sincerely thank all the participants in the Kyiv Summit and all of the donor countries that announced their contributions to Chernobyl projects.  We also welcome the holding of the high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security  scheduled for tomorrow. We are committed to jointly working further on this issue. Our country has unique experience in the rehabilitation of the area and the population victimized by the Chernobyl disaster. We are ready to share this experience. Ukraine consistently supports efforts to ensure gradual and irreversible nuclear disarmament for the purpose of completely eliminating nuclear weapons from the world. We continue to insist that security assurances for non-nuclear and non-aligned States should be enshrined in a legally binding international instrument. I urge the leaders of other States to consciously follow the example of Ukraine and its practical actions to promote disarmament and non-proliferation.  Ukraine is actively participating in United Nations efforts to maintain international peace and security. Throughout its 20 years of independence  over 34 000 Ukraine’s soldiers and police have taken part in peacekeeping missions in more than 20 operations under the United Nations mandate. Ukraine is a dedicated supporter of United Nations peacekeeping reform  the goal of which is to strengthen the Organization’s capacity and eliminate existing shortcomings. Utmost attention should be paid to ensuring the mobility of aviation resources in United Nations peacekeeping  as well as to enhancing legal protection for Blue Helmets. We are grateful to Member States for their support of Ukraine’s initiatives in this area  and we hope for effective joint work to be undertaken in this direction.  One year ago  we held a High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals. Ukraine is committed to its obligations in achieving national development goals. Among our main priorities are poverty reduction  ensuring quality education  environmental protection  improving health and reducing child mortality  curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis  and ensuring gender equality.   Working on today’s immediate tasks  we believe it is necessary to pay greater attention to the    11-50702 6  increasingly acute issue of climate change and environmental protection. We endorse the idea of creating an effective international mechanism for the environmental protection of Earth as our common planet — a global environmental organization with universal membership functioning on a permanent basis. We also call upon Member States to study the idea of developing a new universal instrument that could serve as a so-called environmental constitution  give all countries clear guidelines from the cultural perspective  and identify compulsory principles for the sustainable development of the global green economy and the environmental safety of the planet.  We consider it necessary to work on improving global energy security. We encourage the development  under United Nations coordination  of an effective multilateral cooperation mechanism aimed at achieving development goals in the energy field.  In overcoming the impact of the global economic crisis  we must avoid new challenges to the financial sector that affect trade and investment. It is our belief that economic and social development should be facilitated by the further liberalization of trade.  In recent years  we have come to see how vulnerable any one nation can be to various security threats and natural or manmade disasters. All these examples have shown us the need for effective international mechanisms for combating such phenomena. It is high time that the United Nations and its specialized agencies seriously strengthened their role in coordinating international efforts aimed at preventing  responding to and overcoming the impacts of catastrophes and severe humanitarian crises. We look forward to strengthening the specialized United Nations agencies and improving their effectiveness. Ukraine stands ready to continue its active involvement in the practical humanitarian efforts of the World Food Programme. A few days ago  Ukraine decided to provide  through the United Nations  humanitarian assistance in the form of wheat for the purpose of combating hunger in the Horn of Africa.  Ukraine supports the greater involvement of the General Assembly in international life and strengthening its voice in addressing a wide range of global issues. The modern world is presenting the United Nations with new  complex and increasingly difficult issues. We will not be able to improve the effectiveness of our joint work  however  without comprehensive reform of the Organization and its principal bodies  including the Security Council.   Ukraine is open to discussing all progressive concepts of reform that can bring Member States to the broadest possible agreement. The consideration of the interests of every regional group is an indispensable component of the process of reforming the Council. Ukraine believes that at least one additional non-permanent seat of an expanded Security Council should be given to the Group of Eastern European States.  I am confident that the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly will strengthen the United Nations in the face of global challenges and threats  reliably guaranteed by our strong political commitment and a clear vision of our common goals. I believe in our shared success."
"180",7215,"URY",66,2011,"I come to speak before the Assembly representing a country that is celebrating the two-hundredth anniversary of the endeavour that led to its birth as an independent and sovereign State  and that has preserved its aspiration to continue offering the international community its long-standing tradition of respect for the principles of international law and its ongoing commitment to the cause of peace and peaceful coexistence among nations.  Uruguay takes pride in its calling to serve the international community in promoting dialogue  understanding and the tireless search for consensus as the most appropriate ways for interaction among its members. It was through the application of those principles that we recognized and welcomed this year the 193rd Member of this Organization  the Republic of South Sudan.   Likewise  in March we recognized the State of Palestine. We believe that all of the necessary conditions have been met for this recognition to become universal and for the realization of a two-State solution  which Uruguay has supported since 1947  as well as for a path that reaffirms the right of Israel and Palestine to coexist in peace  within secure and recognized borders  in a environment of renewed cooperation and free from any threats or actions that could jeopardize peace.  The Palestinian people have a legitimate and full right to statehood. But the Jewish people also have the undeniable right to live in peace in a safe country  free of terrorist attacks — attacks that Uruguay has always rejected and condemned.  Uruguay is proud to have made a decisive contribution to the creation of the State of Israel  whose hard-working people have lived up to the historic vision of the men and women who made its creation possible. We are convinced also that the time has come for the Palestinian people to show the world their decisive contribution to peace  development and international cooperation.  Once again  in keeping with our adherence to international law  we cannot but express our utmost rejection of coercive measures that violate the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  such as the economic  trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba — a unilateral measure that contravenes not only the Charter but also international law as well as one of the most important principles of my country’s foreign policy  namely  the peaceful settlement of disputes.  We reject all manner of violence and all threat or use of illegal force  including terrorism — an unjust and unjustified crime  a cruel scourge that 10 years ago most painfully affected New York City. We express our condolences and solidarity to the victims’ families and the American people  as well as our desire and commitment to ensure that these kinds of acts never happen again  here or anywhere else.   While we are guided by the principles of international law  the promotion and protection of human rights and international humanitarian law also figure among the priorities of Uruguayan foreign policy. This a reflection of the country’s political and institutional heritage  that of deep-seated democracy and the solid rule of law.  Allow me to express in that respect my gratitude in connection with the honour conferred on us when Uruguay was elected to chair the Human Rights Council. We will strive to honour this vote of confidence by working every day to strengthen the multilateral system for the protection and promotion of human rights.  Uruguay has an outstanding record in this area  not only because it is one of the countries that has signed the widest array of conventions  but also because it has made specific contributions in diverse fields  including the defence of the rights of the child; the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all United Nations system policies and programmes  as reflected in the establishment and implementation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women; and the promotion of fundamental freedoms  including  inter alia  freedom of expression.   11 11-51384   During the course of its mandate  our country intends to promote a new culture of dialogue on human rights — a culture that favours the cooperation of countries with the system  but also of the system with those countries that need assistance to improve their internal human rights situation. We would also like to enhance the Council’s working methods and promote the implementation of its instruments in a non-selective manner  avoiding double standards. We would also like to strengthen the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  as a key element of promotion and protection mechanisms  by providing the resources necessary so that it can effectively discharge the mandates that Member States are increasingly assigning to it.  Uruguay is not indifferent to situations of armed conflict. That is why we have made tremendous efforts in that respect and will continue to do so in order to maintain and strengthen the applicable norms of international humanitarian law.  In keeping with this  we believe that we cannot ignore mass atrocities such as genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Bearing in mind at all times the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States — a principle that our country and region holds dear — we recognize the State’s primary responsibility to protect its population  as well as the importance of fostering cooperation with States that might require international assistance to fulfil that obligation. The aim is not to weaken their sovereignty but  rather  to strengthen it.  A few months ago  we welcomed the Secretary-General to our country  and we congratulated him once again on his re-election  which Uruguay enthusiastically supported from the outset. Mr. Ban Ki-moon expressed the recognition of the international community of one of the most relevant aspects of our foreign policy over the past several decades: our unwavering and committed participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. With approximately 30 per cent of its operational defence forces devoted to these operations  Uruguay is the main troop contributor as a proportion of its population and ranks 10th in absolute terms. Uruguay thus places at the disposal of the United Nations valuable human and material resources in the context of work that is the flagship of this Organization  deploying in situations and discharging mandates of increasingly complexity.  Given the complexity of current international affairs  together we have begun an in-depth discussion of the United Nations peacekeeping system. We are convinced that these missions will be sustainable only if we seriously reconsider the resources needed for their proper functioning and update the conditions offered by the system so as to ensure that the United Nations is supplied with both equipment and human resources.  Today peacekeeping operations are the most important and visible aspect of United Nations missions and the one that most exposes the United Nations to international scrutiny  often positive but sometimes negative.  Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to peacekeeping operations and to the strictest enforcement of the mandates and standards regulating the conduct of field personnel. That is why  in cases of shameful and unacceptable misconduct — such as that perpetrated by five members of our military deployed in Haiti  where since the beginning of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti we have contributed tens of thousands of men and women  some of whom have offered their lives to help that brother country consolidate peace and stability — we have not hesitated to act with the utmost severity and rigor as the circumstances demanded. Under my country’s military justice  those five individuals accused of military crimes have now been sentenced to prison and the case has been referred to the civil justice system to initiate the corresponding criminal case. Thus  within the framework of respect for due process and in the utmost transparency and cooperation with the relevant United Nations entities  we will stop at nothing to uncover the truth and punish those responsible.  Our commitment to international peace and security has also driven our country to play an active role in the field of disarmament. Like many countries  Uruguay has firmly promoted all initiatives aimed at eliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and at regulating the control and reduction of conventional weapons  which every year cause thousands of innocent civilian casualties.  As a signatory of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  by virtue of which Latin America and the Caribbean became the first nuclear-weapon-free zone  Uruguay has decisively contributed to strengthening both the regional regime and the Treaty on the    11-51384 12  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which is considered the cornerstone of the disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Uruguay has adhered fully to the five points identified by the Secretary-General. We believe that the international community must make the most of progress to date to advance firmly towards a world free from nuclear weapons.  The topic of this year’s general debate is linked to the international peace and security agenda. We therefore welcome the selection of a topic that underlines the pressing need to strengthen the political capacities of the United Nations. Professional and accurate prevention and mediation efforts could save thousands of human lives and billions of dollars of material damage  thereby avoiding the loss of generations  growing resentment and despair  and a vicious cycle of violence can be broken only by reconciliation.  That is why we welcome efforts to strengthen the role of mediation and preventive diplomacy as mechanisms for dispute settlement. Such efforts can be carried out at several levels. There can be no doubt that the United Nations is the natural forum for such efforts  given its intrinsic legitimacy and impartiality. However  it cannot be denied that in practice such efforts must be complemented by the actions of regional entities and even individual countries  which can be very effective  as has been shown in several instances. In addition to the strengthening of the aforementioned capacities  confronting global issues requires the development of community spirit that requires more than combined political will. A systemic approach is fundamental.   Climate change is probably the most obvious example of an urgent global challenge. It is essential to immediately start enforcing adaptation and mitigation measures against its adverse effects  since a compromised environment will limit any development effort. We are aware that necessary measures require changes in modes of production to avoid seriously compromising resource distribution within our countries.  The Uruguayan Government strongly supports negotiations on climate change under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We take this opportunity to call for accelerated efforts to ensure a second stage of commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the outcome of the next Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC. Furthermore  it is essential that progress be made in the negotiations on chemicals  especially in the context of the current exercise on mercury. The sensitivity and importance of this matter  which has greatly potential to harm the environment  requires the commitment of all countries in order to successfully conclude the current negotiations.  Another priority of our country is the particular situation of agriculture as it relates to the climate change phenomenon. A huge number of developing countries  including my own  depend on that sector  which is especially vulnerable to its negative consequences. That is why agriculture requires a special chapter in the framework of the UNFCC negotiations.   A new balance among many centres of power  the emergence of new States and intra-State conflicts have called for a reformulation of peace missions. Global threats include climate change and terrorism  and an international criminal justice entity has been established. Profound political changes have taken place in many countries. We now live in a different world. But the changes do not affect only political and security matters. Enormous transformations are taking place in the global economy and development issues. Developed countries are facing serious difficulties in their efforts to recover from a deep economic crisis. New  so-called emerging economies are playing a growing role in setting the direction of the world economy. In recent years  the need to establish new regulations and global agreements has become ever more apparent. We are entering a new era in international economic relations.  In that context  we must remember that peace and stability will not be achieved without sustainable development. This year  the United Nations has taken very significant steps in recognizing the link between security and development  which is born not from political declarations  but from empirical evidence  and is a sine qua non of capacity-building at the national level.   The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) will provide us with a unique opportunity to renew the will to achieve the goals and commitments contained in Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. The quest for long-term development must be based on a   13 11-51384  comprehensive development concept that takes economic  social and environmental dimensions into account. We believe it essential that Rio+20 achieve tangible results that benefit our citizens. For that to happen  issues related to technology transfer  technical training and financing for developing countries must be taken into account.   Food security is a fundamental component of Uruguay’s development agenda  as well as one of its national priorities. We remain convinced that the current critical situation is caused by structural causes that must be resolved collectively and urgently. We are particularly concerned by the paralysis in the negotiations of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization. That ambitious exercise  one of whose objectives is the reduction or elimination of trade distortions  could  by strengthening trade  promote the development of the most disadvantaged countries of the world.  It is essential to eliminate agricultural subsidies. Countries that until a few decades ago were self-sufficient for their food needs now need to import a large part of what they consume  and they do so from countries that subsidize their agricultural production. The artificially low prices of agriculture exports  sustained for decades by some countries through subsidies and other trade-distorting measures and limitations on market access  are mainly responsible of the food security problems.   Stimulating investment to increase production and improve productivity  a successful conclusion of the Doha Round  as well as the transfer of adequate technology to developing countries  capable of achieving efficient agricultural economies  are fundamental to obtaining food security.  As a middle-income country  Uruguay still faces serious development challenges  particularly in eradicating poverty  diversifying production  introducing technological innovation and promoting renewable energy  to name but a few. The progress achieved must be consolidated  and to that end it is vital for us to be able to count on the support of the international community  and of the United Nations system in particular. I must reiterate the urgent need to consider in depth a new cooperation modality or scheme that takes into account the specific development needs of middle-income countries like Uruguay.  Uruguay is committed to the reform process of the Organization. Through the Global Governance Group  we have maintained a proactive attitude in order to promote a strong bond between the United Nations and informal discussion forums outside the system. However  it is critical to lead by example. For that reason  we believe that improving global governance is first an internal task of the United Nations system. In this regard  my country is very satisfied with the results obtained in the pilot programme of Delivering as One  whose next intergovernmental conference will be held in November in Montevideo.  For all these reason  but above all because of its firm commitment to the cause of peace and multilateralism  Uruguay is seeking a seat as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2016-2017. That would be our country’s second time in the past 66 years  after having served in 1965-1966.  In conclusion  consolidating multilateralism is one of the most challenging international tasks. Multiple ongoing crises demand immediate response and action. The rise of new informal forums with a limited number of members but a growing influence in international governance requires an additional collective effort to strengthen the role of the United Nations as a forum for political discussion in which all States are able to participate in decision-making.   A permanent effort is required to combine effectiveness with legitimacy — a challenge that has become increasingly more significant as globalization deepens. We need a new United Nations for the twenty-first century. The first decade of the century has already run its course. History is harsh with those who cannot adapt to its challenges  and its consequences are bitter. At the United Nations  we are responsible for putting forward appropriate answers to the international community. There is still time."
"181",7262,"USA",66,2011,"It is a great honour for me to be here today. I would like to talk to the General Assembly about a subject that is at the heart of the United Nations — the pursuit of peace in an imperfect world.  War and conflict have been with us since the beginning of civilization. But in the first part of the twentieth century  the advance of modern weaponry led to death on a staggering scale. It was that killing that    11-50692 10  compelled the founders of this body to build an institution that was focused not just on ending one war  but on averting others; a union of sovereign States that would seek to prevent conflict while also addressing its causes.  No American did more to pursue that objective than President Franklin Roosevelt. He knew that a victory in war was not enough. As he said at one of the very first meetings on the founding of the United Nations  “We have got to make not merely peace  but a peace that will last”.  The men and women who built this institution understood that peace is more than the absence of war. A lasting peace — for nations and individuals — depends upon a sense of justice and opportunity; of dignity and freedom. It depends upon struggle and sacrifice; on compromise and on a sense of common humanity.  One delegate to the San Francisco Conference  which led to the creation of the United Nations  put it well:  “Many people have talked as if all we had to do to get peace was to say loudly and frequently that we loved peace and hated war. Now we have learned that no matter how much we love peace and hate war  we cannot avoid having war brought upon us if there are convulsions in other parts of the world”.  The fact is  peace is hard  but our people demand it. Over nearly seven decades  even as the United Nations helped avert a third world war  we still live in a world scarred by conflict and plagued by poverty. Even as we proclaim our love for peace and hatred of war  there are still convulsions in our world that endanger us all.  I took office at a time of two wars for the United States. Moreover  the violent extremists who drew us into war in the first place — Osama bin Laden and his Al-Qaida organization — remained at large. Today  we have set a new direction.  At the end of this year  America’s military operation in Iraq will be over. We will have a normal relationship with a sovereign nation that is a member of the community of nations. That equal partnership will be strengthened by our support for Iraq — for its Government and its security forces  for its people and their aspirations.  As we end the war in Iraq  the United States and our coalition partners have begun a transition in Afghanistan. Between now and 2014  an increasingly capable Afghan Government and security forces will step forward to take responsibility for the future of their country. As they do  we are drawing down our own forces  while building an enduring partnership with the Afghan people.  So let there be no doubt: the tide of war is receding. When I took office  roughly 180 000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of this year  that number will be cut in half  and it will continue to decline. This is critical for the sovereignty of Iraq and Afghanistan  and to the strength of the United States as we build our nation at home.  Moreover  we are poised to end these wars from a position of strength. Ten years ago  there was an open wound and twisted steel; a broken heart in the centre of this city. Today  as a new tower is rising at Ground Zero  it symbolizes New York’s renewal  even as Al-Qaida is under more pressure than ever before. Its leadership has been degraded. Osama bin Laden  a man who murdered thousands of people from dozens of countries  will never endanger the peace of the world again.  Yes  this has been a difficult decade. But today we stand at a crossroads of history  with the chance to move decisively in the direction of peace. To do so we must return to the wisdom of those who created this institution.   The founding Charter of United Nations calls upon us  to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that  “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in rights”. Those bedrock beliefs — in the responsibility of States and the rights of men and women — must be our guide.  In that effort  we have reason to hope. This year has been a time of extraordinary transformation. More nations have stepped forward to maintain international peace and security. More individuals are claiming their universal right to live in freedom and dignity.  Think about it. One year ago  when we met here in New York  the prospect of a successful referendum in South Sudan was in doubt. But the international community overcame old divisions to support the   11 11-50692  agreement that had been negotiated to give South Sudan self-determination. Last summer  as a new flag went up in Juba  former soldiers laid down their arms  men and women wept with joy and children finally knew the promise of looking to a future that they will shape.  One year ago  the people of Côte d’Ivoire approached a landmark election. When the incumbent lost and refused to respect the results  the world refused to look the other way. United Nations peacekeepers were harassed  but they did not leave their posts. The Security Council  led by the United States  Nigeria and France  came together to support the will of the people. Côte d’Ivoire is now governed by the man who was elected to lead.  One year ago  the hopes of the people of Tunisia were suppressed. But they chose the dignity of peaceful protest over the rule of an iron fist. A vendor lit a spark that took his own life  but ignited a movement. In the face of a crackdown  students spelled out the word freedom. The balance of fear shifted from the ruler to those whom he ruled. Now the people of Tunisia are preparing for elections that will move them one step closer to the democracy that they deserve.  One year ago  Egypt had known one President for nearly 30 years. But for 18 days  the eyes of the world were glued to Tahrir Square  where Egyptians from all walks of life — men and women  young and old  Muslim and Christian — demanded their universal rights. We saw in those protesters the moral force of non-violence that has lit the world from Delhi to Warsaw  from Selma to South Africa — and we knew that change had come to Egypt and to the Arab world.  One year ago  the people of Libya were ruled by the world’s longest-serving dictator. But faced with bullets and bombs and a dictator who threatened to hunt them down like rats  they showed relentless bravery. We will never forget the words of the Libyan who stood up in those early days of the revolution and said  “Our words are free now”. It is a feeling one cannot explain. Day after day  in the face of bullets and bombs  the Libyan people refused to give back that freedom. And when they were threatened by the kind of mass atrocity that often went unchallenged in the past century  the United Nations lived up to its Charter. The Security Council authorized all necessary measures to prevent a massacre. The Arab League called for that effort. Arab nations joined a NATO-led coalition that halted Al-Qadhafi’s forces in their tracks.  In the months that followed  the will of the coalition proved unbreakable  and the will of the Libyan people could not be denied. Forty-two years of tyranny were ended in six months. From Tripoli to Misurata to Benghazi — today  Libya is free. Yesterday  the leaders of a new Libya took their rightful place beside us  and this week the United States is reopening our embassy in Tripoli.  This is how the international community is supposed to work — nations standing together for the sake of peace and security  and individuals claiming their rights. Now  all of us have a responsibility to support the new Libya and the new Libyan Government as they confront the challenge of turning this moment of promise into a just and lasting peace for all Libyans.  So this has been a remarkable year. The Al-Qadhafi regime is over. Gbagbo  Ben Ali and Mubarak are no longer in power. Osama bin Laden is gone  and the idea that change could come only through violence has been buried with him. Something is happening in our world. The way things have been is not the way that they will be. The humiliating grip of corruption and tyranny is being pried open. Dictators are on notice. Technology is putting power into the hands of the people. Youth are delivering a powerful rebuke to dictatorship and rejecting the lie that some races  some peoples  some religions and some ethnicities do not desire democracy. The promise written down on paper — “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” — is closer at hand.  But let us remember: Peace is hard. Peace is hard. Progress can be reversed. Prosperity comes slowly. Societies can split apart. The measure of our success must be whether people can live in sustained freedom  dignity and security. And the United Nations and its Member States must do their part to support those basic aspirations. And we have more work to do.  In Iran  we have seen a Government that refuses to recognize the rights of its own people. As we meet here today  men  women and children are being tortured  detained and murdered by the Syrian regime. Thousands have been killed  many during the holy time of Ramadan. Thousands more have poured across Syria’s borders. The Syrian people have shown dignity    11-50692 12  and courage in their pursuit of justice  protesting peacefully  standing silently in the streets and dying for the same values that this institution is supposed to stand for. And the question for us is clear: Will we stand with the Syrian people or with their oppressors?  Already  the United States has imposed strong sanctions on Syria’s leaders. We supported a transfer of power that would be responsive to the Syrian people. And many of our allies have joined in this effort. But for the sake of Syria — and the peace and security of the world — we must speak with one voice. There is no excuse for inaction. Now is the time for the Security Council to sanction the Syrian regime and to stand with the Syrian people.  Throughout the region  we will have to respond to the calls for change. In Yemen  men  women and children gather by the thousands in towns and city squares every day with the hope that their determination and spilled blood will prevail over a corrupt system. America supports those aspirations. We must work with Yemen’s neighbours and our partners around the world to seek a path that allows for a peaceful transition of power from President Saleh  and a movement to free and fair elections as soon as possible.  In Bahrain  steps have been taken towards reform and accountability. We are pleased with that  but more is required. America is a close friend of Bahrain  and we will continue to call on the Government and the main opposition bloc — al-Wifaq — to pursue a meaningful dialogue that brings peaceful change that is responsive to the people. We believe the patriotism that binds Bahrainis together must be more powerful than the sectarian forces that would tear them apart. It will be hard  but it is possible.  We believe that each nation must chart its own course to fulfil the aspirations of its people. America does not expect to agree with every party or person who expresses themselves politically  but we will always stand up for the universal rights that were embraced by this Assembly. Those rights depend on elections that are free and fair  governance that is transparent and accountable  respect for the rights of women and minorities  and justice that is equal and fair. That is what our people deserve. Those are the elements of peace that can last.  Moreover  the United States will continue to support  with greater trade and investment  those nations that transition to democracy  so that freedom is followed by opportunity. We will pursue deeper engagement with Governments  but also with civil society — students and entrepreneurs  political parties and the press. We have banned those who abuse human rights from travelling to our country and we have sanctioned those who trample on human rights abroad. And we will always serve as a voice for those who have been silenced.  Now  I know  particularly this week  that for many in this Hall  there is one issue that stands as a test of these principles and a test of American foreign policy  and that is the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  One year ago  I stood at this podium and I called for an independent Palestine. I believed then  and I believe now  that the Palestinian people deserve a State of their own  but what I also said is that a genuine peace can be realized only between the Israelis and the Palestinians themselves. One year later  despite extensive efforts by America and others  the parties have not bridged their differences. Faced with this stalemate  I put forward a new basis for negotiations in May of this year. That basis is clear. It is well known to all of us here. Israelis must know that any agreement provides assurances for their security. Palestinians deserve to know the territorial basis of their State.  I know that many are frustrated by the lack of progress; I assure them that I am too. But the question is not the goal that we seek. The question is: How do we reach that goal? And I am convinced that there is no shortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades. Peace is hard work. Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the United Nations. If it were that easy  it would have been accomplished by now. Ultimately  it is the Israelis and the Palestinians who must live side by side. Ultimately  it is the Israelis and the Palestinians — not us — who must reach agreement on the issues that divide them: on borders and on security  on refugees and on Jerusalem.  Ultimately  peace depends upon compromise among people who must live together long after our speeches are over  long after our votes have been tallied. That is the lesson of Northern Ireland  where ancient antagonists bridged their differences. That is the lesson of the Sudan  where a negotiated settlement led to an independent State. And that is and will be the   13 11-50692  path to a Palestinian State — negotiations between the parties.  We seek a future where Palestinians live in a sovereign State of their own  with no limit to what they can achieve. There is no question that the Palestinians have seen that vision delayed for too long. It is precisely because we believe so strongly in the aspirations of the Palestinian people that America has invested so much time and so much effort in the building of a Palestinian State and in the negotiations that can deliver a Palestinian State.  But understand this as well: America’s commitment to Israel’s security is unshakeable. Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we believe that any lasting peace must acknowledge the very real security concerns that Israel faces every single day.  Let us be honest with ourselves: Israel is surrounded by neighbours that have waged repeated wars against it. Israel’s citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses. Israel’s children come of age knowing that throughout the region other children are taught to hate them. Israel  a small country of less than 8 million people  looks out at a world where leaders of much larger nations threaten to wipe it off of the map. The Jewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile and persecution and fresh memories of knowing that 6 million people were killed simply because of who they are. Those are facts. They cannot be denied.  The Jewish people have forged a successful State in their historic homeland. Israel deserves recognition. It deserves normal relations with its neighbours. And friends of the Palestinians do them no favours by ignoring that truth  just as friends of Israel must recognize the need to pursue a two-State solution with a secure Israel next to an independent Palestine.  That is the truth. Each side has legitimate aspirations  and that is part of what makes peace so hard. And the deadlock will be broken only when each side learns to stand in the other’s shoes and each side can see the world through the other’s eyes. That is what we should be encouraging. That is what we should be promoting.  This body — founded as it was out of the ashes of war and genocide  and dedicated as it is to the dignity of every single person — must recognize the reality that is lived by the Palestinians and the Israelis alike. The measure of our actions must always be whether they advance the right of Israeli and Palestinian children to live lives of peace and security and dignity and opportunity. And we will succeed in that effort only if we can encourage the parties to sit down  to listen to each other and to understand each other’s hopes and each other’s fears. That is the project to which America is committed. There are no shortcuts. And that is what the United Nations should be focused on in the weeks and months to come.  Even as we confront these challenges of conflict and revolution  we must also recognize — and we must also remind ourselves — that peace is not just the absence of war. True peace depends on creating the opportunity that makes life worth living. And to do that  we must confront the common enemies of humanity: nuclear weapons and poverty  ignorance and disease. Those forces corrode the possibility of lasting peace and together we are called upon to confront them.  To lift the spectre of mass destruction  we must come together to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. Over the past two years  we have begun to walk down that path. Since our Nuclear Security Summit in Washington  D.C.  nearly 50 nations have taken steps to secure nuclear materials from terrorists and smugglers. Next March  a summit in Seoul will advance our efforts to lock down all of them. The New START Treaty between the United States and Russia will cut our deployed arsenals to the lowest level in half a century  and our nations are pursuing talks on how to achieve even deeper reductions. America will continue to work for a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons and the production of fissile material needed to make them.  And so we have begun to move in the right direction. And the United States is committed to meeting our obligations. But even as we meet our obligations  we have strengthened the treaties and institutions that help stop the spread of those weapons. And to do so  we must continue to hold accountable those nations that flout them.  The Iranian Government cannot demonstrate that its programme is peaceful. It has not met its obligations and it rejects offers that would provide it with peaceful nuclear power. North Korea has yet to take concrete steps towards abandoning its weapons and continues    11-50692 14  belligerent action against the South. There is a future of greater opportunity for the people of those nations if their Governments meet their international obligations. But if they continue down a path that is outside international law  they must be met with greater pressure and isolation. That is what our commitment to peace and security demands.  To bring prosperity to our people  we must promote the growth that creates opportunity. In this effort  let us not forget that we have made enormous progress over the past several decades. Closed societies gave way to open markets. Innovation and entrepreneurship have transformed the way we live and the things that we do. Emerging economies from Asia to the Americas have lifted hundreds of millions of people from poverty. It is an extraordinary achievement.   And yet  three years ago  we were confronted with the worst financial crisis in eight decades. And that crisis proved a fact that has become clearer with each passing year. Our fates are interconnected. In a global economy  nations will rise or fall together.  Today  we confront the challenges that have followed on the heels of that crisis. Around the world recovery is still fragile. Markets remain volatile. Too many people are out of work. Too many others are struggling just to get by. We acted together to avert a depression in 2009. We must take urgent and coordinated action once more.  Here in the United States  I have announced a plan to put Americans back to work and jump-start our economy  at the same time as I am committed to substantially reducing our deficits over time.  We stand with our European allies as they reshape their institutions and address their own fiscal challenges. For other countries  leaders face a different challenge as they shift their economy towards more self-reliance  boosting domestic demand while slowing inflation. So we will work with emerging economies that have rebounded strongly so that rising standards of living create new markets that promote global growth. That is what our commitment to prosperity demands.  To combat the poverty that punishes our children  we must act on the belief that freedom from want is a basic human right. The United States has made it a focus of our engagement abroad to help people to feed themselves. And today  as drought and conflict have brought famine to the Horn of Africa  our conscience calls on us to act. Together  we must continue to provide assistance and support organizations that can reach those in need. And together  we must insist on unrestricted humanitarian access so that we can save the lives of thousands of men and women and children. Our common humanity is at stake. Let us show that the life of a child in Somalia is as precious as any other. That is what our commitment to our fellow human beings demands.  To stop disease that spreads across borders  we must strengthen our system of public health. We will continue the fight against HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. We will focus on the health of mothers and of children. And we must come together to prevent and detect and fight every kind of biological danger — whether it is a pandemic like H1N1 or a terrorist threat or a treatable disease.  This week  America signed an agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) to affirm our commitment to meeting that challenge. And today  I urge all nations to join us in meeting the WHO goal of making sure all nations have core capacities to address public health emergencies in place by 2012. That is what our commitment to the health of our people demands.  To preserve our planet  we must not put off action that climate change demands. We have to tap the power of science to save those resources that are scarce. And together  we must continue our work to build on the progress made in Copenhagen and Cancún  so that all the major economies represented here today follow through on the commitments that were made. Together  we must work to transform the energy that powers our economies and support others as they move down that path. That is what our commitment to the next generation demands.  To make sure our societies reach their potential  we must allow our citizens to reach theirs. No country can afford the corruption that plagues the world like a cancer. Together  we must harness the power of open societies and open economies. That is why we have partnered with countries across the globe to launch a new partnership on open Government that helps ensure accountability and helps to empower citizens. No country should deny people their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion  but also no country should deny people their rights because of whom they   15 11-50692  love  which is why we must stand up for the rights of gays and lesbians everywhere.  No country can realize its potential if half its population cannot reach theirs. This week  the United States signed a new declaration on women’s participation. Next year  we should each announce the steps we are taking to break down the economic and political barriers that stand in the way of women and girls. That is what our commitment to human progress demands.  I know there is no straight line to that progress  no single path to success. We come from different cultures  and carry with us different histories. But let us never forget that even as we gather here as Heads of different Governments  we represent citizens who share the same basic aspirations to live with dignity and freedom  to get an education and pursue opportunity  to love our families and love and worship our God  to live in the kind of peace that makes life worth living.  It is the nature of our imperfect world that we are forced to learn these lessons over and over again. Conflict and repression will endure so long as some people refuse to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Yet that is precisely why we have built institutions like this — to bind our fates together  to help us recognize ourselves in each other — because those who came before us believed that peace is preferable to war  and freedom is preferable to suppression  and prosperity is preferable to poverty. That is the message that comes not from capitals  but from citizens  from our people.  When the cornerstone of this very building was put in place  President Truman came here to New York and said  “The United Nations is essentially an expression of the moral nature of man’s aspirations” — the moral nature of man’s aspirations. As we live in a world that is changing at a breathtaking pace  that is a lesson that we must never forget.  Peace is hard  but we know that it is possible. So  together  let us be resolved to see that it is defined by our hopes and not by our fears. Together  let us make peace — but a peace  most importantly  that will last."
"182",7284,"UZB",66,2011,"Allow me at the outset to extend my greetings to all those who are participating in the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and to wish them every success in their endeavours. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his reappointment to that high post for a second term. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at the sixty-sixth session  and wish him fruitful work.  In 2011  Uzbekistan has been celebrating a landmark date in its modern history — the twentieth anniversary of independence. Only 20 years have passed since the Republic of Uzbekistan became an independent State and joined the ranks of the fully fledged Members of the United Nations  having gained the right to decide and build on its own present and future  but over that period Uzbekistan has made significant progress in building an independent State  developing the national economy and modernizing the country.  During those years  the Republic of Uzbekistan has transformed itself from a sluggish raw materials-based economy  with a destructive monoculture of cotton  an underdeveloped industrial and social infrastructure and low-per-capita consumption  into a modern country with a steadily developing economy.  The following evidence clearly testifies to the fact that  over the past 20 years of independent development  Uzbekistan’s economy has grown by a factor of 3.5 and the population’s total income has increased by a factor of 20. Despite the negative impact of the ongoing global financial and economic crisis  Uzbekistan continues to develop at a steady pace. Over the past five years  the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 8.5 per cent. This year  it is expected that that level will be maintained.  Striking achievements have been made in implementing the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration. During the years of independence  State expenditure in the social sector has increased more than fivefold. About 60 per cent of the annual budget is devoted to the development of health care  education  communal services  social welfare and other sectors. Some 82.5 per cent of the population has access to clean drinking water and 83.5 per cent to natural gas.  I would like to underscore in particular the huge role and significance in all those changes of education    11-51390 2  and people’s increasing awareness. Annual expenditure on education in Uzbekistan amounts to 10 to 12 per cent of GDP  whereas that indicator worldwide does not exceed 3 to 5 per cent. An exceptional national programme to train skilled personnel and workers has been launched. From 2009  a mandatory 12-year education programme was introduced. Uzbekistan has set up more than 1 600 modern vocational colleges and high schools.  Such indicators  which are not often seen across the world  clearly affirm that our most important goal is ensure the quality of life and protect the interests of citizens. The Uzbek model for the country’s democratization and transition to a socially oriented market economy  adopted in the early years of our independence  has served as the basis for those achievements.  Our country is steadily progressing towards achieving the goal we have set ourselves  namely  to join the ranks of the modern  developed and democratic States and to ensure for its people a high standard of living and a dignified place in the world community.  Today  we have every reason to affirm that we have achieved the main goal  that is  the country’s irreversible and steady reform and democratization. The conceptual framework for further deepening the democratic reforms and establishing civil society in the country  developed by the President of Uzbekistan  Islam Karimov  in November 2010  provides for the further development and strengthening of Uzbekistan’s long-term sustainable development model. The conceptual framework calls for further democratization of State authority and governance  reforming the judicial system  establishing and developing civil society institutions  ensuring freedom of speech and information  developing the electoral law  further deepening market reform and liberalizing the economy.  In assessing the state of affairs in Central Asia  it is important to note that  given its geopolitical and geostrategic significance and the very rich natural resources  the region continues to be the focus of the international community’s attention in the context of the growing threats and challenges to security and stability in the world.  First  the war that has been under way in Afghanistan for more than 30 years continues to be the main destabilizing factor  not only in the region but also in the entire world. More unfortunately  the situation remains tense despite all the measures now being taken by the international community. It is important to underscore  in particular  that today  everyone is sure that there is no military solution to the Afghan problem. Almost all leaders  including those involved in resolving the Afghan issue and the direct military command of the coalition forces in Afghanistan  are of this view.  We firmly believe that the Afghan people themselves must resolve their country’s problems. Only through a compromise between the warring parties with the Afghans themselves being involved in that process  as well as the socio-economic recovery of Afghanistan with the help of the international community  will it be possible to find a way out of the current deadlock in Afghanistan’s situation.   President Karimov already stated that at the NATO Summit in Bucharest in April 2008. We see the future of Afghanistan as a peaceful and steadily developing State that poses no threat to neighbouring countries  such that the people living in the region can fully enjoy the benefits of friendly  mutually beneficial and equal relations. Uzbekistan will continue to pursue a policy of good-neighbourliness and cooperation towards Afghanistan on a bilateral basis  in accordance with mutual national interests.  Secondly  the tragic events in Kyrgyzstan in June 2010 posed a serious challenge to peace and stability in the Central Asian region. More than a year has passed since those bloody events. However  to date no political or legal conclusions on all those forces and specific individuals who ordered  organized and perpetrated the crimes have been drawn. Until such investigations are completed and the perpetrators  irrespective of their nationality  origin or position  are punished  it is difficult to envisage the restoration of trust and cooperation between the Uzbek community and the Kyrgyz.  Thirdly  the socio-economic development not only of our country  but also of the entire Central Asian region  is hampered by the ecological catastrophe of the Aral Sea. In practically the span of one generation  it has changed from once being one of the most exceptional and most beautiful seas into a drying and disappearing pool. Today  the Aral Sea basin faces a range of ecological  socio-economic and demographic problems of global consequences. The Secretary-  3 11-51390  General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  himself was convinced of that while visiting the Aral Sea last year.  In such circumstances  attempts to build huge hydropower facilities on the upper reaches of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers are counterproductive and dangerous  since they pose serious threats to public safety in terms both of environmental  social and technical risks and of preserving the volume and course of the river flow.  In addressing such problems  we proceed on the premise that any use of transboundary watercourses must take into account the interests of all States located in their basins  and should be carried out in accordance with international law. I refer in particular to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes of 17 March 1992 and the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of 21 May 1997.  We do not ignore the rights of the upstream countries to develop their hydropower sector. In our view  this is a very important sector of the economy. However  it would be safer and more rational to build cascades of small hydropower plants with the same total production capacity. Our country’s position is not only fully consistent with relevant international law and accepted regulations  but it is also  and most importantly  derived from them.  In conclusion  Uzbekistan supports the theme proposed by the President of the General Assembly for this session’s general debate  namely  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. We fully share his view regarding the importance of strengthening multilateral machinery so as to ensure a stable and just world order that is capable of effectively responding to emerging threats to regional stability and international security.

"183",7297,"VAT",66,2011,"I have the pleasure of congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure you of the full and sincere collaboration of the Holy See. I also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who during this session  on 1 January 2012  will begin his second term.   I would also like to cordially welcome the delegation of South Sudan  which became the 193rd Member State of the Organization last July.  Every year  the general debate offers the opportunity to address the principal questions that concern humanity in search of a better future for all. The challenges facing the international community are many and difficult. They bring ever more clearly in focus the profound interdependence within the family of nations  which sees in the United Nations an important agent  despite its limitations  for identifying and implementing solutions to major international problems.   Without attempting an exhaustive survey  my delegation wishes to reflect on a few of the priority challenges so that the concept of the family of nations can increasingly take shape.  The first challenge is a humanitarian one. It calls the whole international community — or better  the family of nations — to look after its weakest members. In certain parts of the world  such as the Horn of Africa  we are  sadly  facing grave humanitarian emergencies that force millions of people — the majority women and children — to leave their homes  large numbers of them being victims of drought  famine and malnutrition.   The Holy See renews its appeal to the international community  expressed many times by Pope Benedict XVI  to amplify and support humanitarian policies in those areas and to work to concretely address the various factors that amplify their vulnerability.   41 11-51670   These humanitarian emergencies make clear the need to find innovative ways to put to work the principle of the responsibility to protect  at the base of which is the recognition of the unity of the human family and the innate dignity of every man and every woman. As is known  that principle points to the responsibility of the international community to intervene in situations in which Governments on their own cannot — or do not wish to — comply with their primary responsibility to protect their populations against grave violations of human rights and the effects of humanitarian crises. If States are no longer capable of guaranteeing that protection  the international community must intervene with the juridical means foreseen in the United Nations Charter and other international instruments.  However  it must be recalled that there is a risk that that principle may be invoked in certain circumstances as a pretext to use military force. It is good to recall that even the use of force in keeping with the United Nations rules should be a temporary solution  a true emergency measure  accompanied and followed by a concrete commitment to pacification.  For that reason  in taking up the challenge of the responsibility to protect  we must engage in a deeper search for the means to prevent and manage conflicts  exploring all possible diplomatic avenues through negotiation and constructive dialogue  noting and encouraging even the weakest signs of willingness to negotiate or desire for reconciliation on the part of the parties involved.  The responsibility to protect must be thought of not as military intervention alone — which should always be the last recourse — but above all as a requirement that the international community be united in facing crises. It must create forums for genuine  sincere negotiations  support the moral force of law  seek the common good and encourage Governments  civil society and public opinion to find the causes of and offer solutions to crises of all kinds. I must act in close collaboration and solidarity with the affected populations and place above all else the integrity and security of all citizens.   It is therefore important that the responsibility to protect  understood in that sense  should be the criterion and motivation that underlies all the work of States and of the United Nations to restore peace  security and the human rights. Moreover  the long and generally successful history of peacekeeping operations and the more recent initiatives in peacebuilding can offer valuable lessons for conceiving models for implementing the responsibility to protect in full respect for international law and for the legitimate interests of all the parties involved.  Respect for freedom of religion is a fundamental factor in peacebuilding  the recognition of human dignity and the safeguarding of the human rights. This is the second challenge I would like to reflect on.  The situations in which the right to freedom of religion is violated or is denied to believers of different religions are unfortunately many. We have witnessed rising intolerance for religious reasons. Christians are the religious group that currently suffers the greatest persecution because of their faith.   The lack of respect for freedom of religion threatens security and peace and hinders authentic integral human development. The particular weight of a given religion in a nation should never mean that citizens of other faiths are discriminated against in social life or  worse still  that violence against them is tolerated. In that connection  it is important that a common commitment to recognize and promote the religious freedom of every person and every community be promoted by engaging in sincere interreligious dialogue  encouraged and supported by Governments and international bodies.   I reiterate the concerned appeal made by the Holy See to authorities and religious leaders to adopt effective measures for the protection of religious minorities  wherever they are threatened. In that way  believers of all faiths everywhere will be able to live in security and continue to make a contribution to their society.   In thinking about the situation in some countries  I would like to repeat in particular that Christians are citizens like any other citizens  connected to their homeland and faithful to all of their national duties. It is natural that they should enjoy all the rights of citizenship  freedom of conscience and worship  freedom in teaching and education and freedom in the use of communications media.  Moreover  in some countries  although much importance is placed on pluralism and tolerance  paradoxically there is a tendency to consider religion as something foreign to modern society or even as a    11-51670 42  destabilizing force. Various means are sought to marginalize religion and prevent it from having any influence on social life.   But how can anyone deny the contribution of the world’s great religions to the development of civilization? As Pope Benedict XVI stressed  the sincere search for God has led to greater respect for human dignity. For example  Christian communities  with their heritage of values and principles  have contributed much to making individuals and peoples aware of their own identity and their dignity  as well as to the establishment of rule-of-law institutions and the recognition of human rights and their corresponding responsibilities. From that standpoint  it is important that believers  today as yesterday  feel free to offer their contribution to the promotion of a more just human order  not only through their responsible involvement in civic  economic and political life  but also through the witness of their charity and faith.  A third challenge that the Holy See would like to bring to the attention of the Assembly is the continuing global economic and financial crisis.   We all know that a fundamental element of the current crisis is the deficit in ethics in the economic structures. Ethics are not an external element of the economy; the economy has no future if it has no moral element. In other words  the ethical dimension is essential in addressing economic problems. The economy does not function only through market self-regulation  and even less through agreements that are limited to accommodating the interests of the most powerful.   The economy needs an ethical raison d’être in order to work for humankind. The notion of producing resources and goods — that is  the economy — and of managing them strategically — that is  politics — without seeking to do good through those same acts — that is  without ethics — has proven to be a naïve or cynical illusion  and always fatal. Moreover  every economic decision has a moral consequence.   The economy therefore needs ethics to function properly — not just any ethic  but a people-centred ethic that can offer prospects to new generations. Economic and commercial activities oriented towards development should be able to effectively reduce poverty and alleviate the suffering of the most disenfranchised.   In that regard  the Holy See encourages strengthening official development assistance in accordance with the Group of Eight commitments made at Gleneagles. My delegation hopes that the debates on this theme at the forthcoming High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development will bring the expected results.   Furthermore  the Holy See has repeatedly stressed the importance of new and more in-depth thinking on the meaning of the economy and its objectives  as well as a forward-looking review of the global trade and financial architecture to correct its dysfunctions and distortions. This review of international economic rules must form part of wider efforts to forge a new global development model. Indeed  the state of our planet’s environmental health  and above all the cultural and moral crisis of humankind — the symptoms of which have been evident around the world for some time — demand this.  These considerations should also inspire the work of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  to be held in June  on the conviction that “Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development”  as stated in the Principle 1 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.   The sense of environmental responsibility and preservation should be guided by our awareness of being a family of nations. The idea of “family” immediately evokes something more than merely functional relationships or a simple convergence of interests. A family is by nature a community based on interdependence  mutual trust  mutual aid and sincere respect. Its full development is based not on the supremacy of the strongest  but on the attention paid to the weakest and most marginalized  and its responsibility extends to future generations. Respect for the environment should make us more attuned to the needs of the most disenfranchised. It should create a development strategy centred on the individual that promotes solidarity and the shared responsibility of all  including future generations.  This strategy can only benefit from the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty  planned for 2012. An unregulated and non-transparent arms trade has significant negative repercussions. It hampers integral human development and heightens the risk of   43 11-51670  conflicts  especially internal conflicts  and instability. It fosters a culture of violence and impunity  which is often linked to such criminal activities as drug trafficking  trafficking in human beings and piracy. These are becoming ever more serious international problems.   The results of the current arms trade treaty process will test the true willingness of States to assume their moral and legal responsibilities in that regard. The international community  conscious of the great numbers of people affected by the illegal trade in arms and ammunition and aware of their suffering  must focus on concluding an arms trade treaty that is effective and enforceable. Indeed  the primary objective of the treaty should be not only to regulate the trade in conventional arms and obstruct the black market  but also and most importantly to protect human life and build a world more respectful of human dignity.  Indeed  the United Nations’ contribution to building a world more respectful of human dignity will demonstrate its ability to effectively carry out its mission  which is to help the family of nations to pursue the common objectives of peace  security and integral development for all.  The Holy See is also concerned about the events unfolding in some countries of North Africa and the Middle East. I would like to take this opportunity to renew the appeal made by the Holy Father Benedict XVI  who called on all citizens  particularly young people  to do their utmost to promote the common good and build societies in which poverty is overcome  in which every political choice is inspired by respect for human beings and in which peace and harmony will triumph over divisions  hatred and violence.  A final observation concerns Palestine’s request for recognition as a Member State of the United Nations  made here on 23 September by the President of the Palestinian National Authority  Mr. Mahmoud Abbas. The Holy See views this initiative as an attempt to find a definitive solution  with the support of the international community  to the question already addressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947. That fundamental document sets down the legal framework for the existence of two States. One of them has already been born  while the other has not yet been established  although nearly 65 years have passed.  The Holy See is convinced that if one desires peace  brave decisions must be taken. It hopes that the competent bodies of the United Nations are resolved to help effectively implement the final objective  that is  achieving the Palestinians’ right to have their own independent and sovereign State and the Israelis’ right to security  both States with internationally recognized borders.   The response of the United Nations  whatever it may be  will not be a complete solution. Lasting peace can be achieved only through good-faith negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians  avoiding actions or conditions that contradict declarations of goodwill. The Holy See therefore urges the parties to return to negotiations with resolve. It urgently appeals to the international community to increase its commitment and stimulate its creativity and initiatives in order to reach a lasting peace  in respect for the rights of the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"184",7332,"VCT",66,2011,"I am pleased to add my voice to the unanimous acclaim of His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser as President of the General Assembly for this  our sixty-sixth session. A skilful and seasoned diplomat  he has played an integral role in establishing the State of Qatar as a central and crucial actor in international diplomacy. I have no doubt that he will approach his new responsibilities with similar dedication  even-handedness and compassion.  In recent months the winds of change have encircled the globe  reaching and reshaping the unlikeliest corners of our planet  for good and for ill. Those winds have swept the nation of South Sudan into these hallowed halls as a welcome and esteemed new member of our global family. They are blowing away the flimsy impediments to Palestinian statehood  and breathing fresh air into stagnant negotiating processes. The winds of change have howled across the sands of the Middle East and North Africa  reshaping long-held geopolitical assumptions.  The grim economic storm clouds that formed ominously on our global horizon three years ago have yet to dissipate  and  indeed  seem to be multiplying. Natural disasters  climate change  and the accompanying non-metaphorical winds of hurricanes   17 11-51360  and tropical storms have buffeted my multi-island nation and my region yet again  upending our fragile economies and causing painful developmental setbacks.  The United Nations finds itself in the eye of these increasingly turbulent geopolitical and socio-economic storms. The role that we collectively play in response to these howling gales will determine the contours of the post-crisis world and the relevance of this institution in that world. Will the international community shield the vulnerable from these winds? Will we harness their power for positive change? Or will we become little more than unnecessary weather forecasters  watching and warning about which way the winds blow  but never acting for the benefit of our peoples’ humanization?  The President has wisely selected “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes” as the theme of this general debate. That theme could not be more apt or timely. Too often  the difficult work of mediation  negotiation and peaceful resolution of disputes is prematurely abandoned in the search for a quick fix of militarism  brinkmanship or ill-advised unilateral action. The very drafters of hard-fought Security Council resolutions often cast aside the letter and spirit of those documents before their ink has dried  and the frenzied pursuit of a military solution to every dispute is sometimes sickeningly palpable.  All too frequently  the loudest champions of expensive and unnecessary military action are those leaders of military Powers who sometimes seek to shore up sagging local political fortunes with bullets  bombs and the bodies of faceless foreigners in faraway lands. History has never been kind to such nakedly political crusades  and those who have sown the wind have invariably reaped the whirlwind of their bloody campaigns  long after the triumphalist glow has faded. Neocolonialist and imperialist adventures  however disguised  will never triumph before the bar of history over a people’s right to self-determination and the inalienable embrace of sovereignty.  The ongoing global economic and financial crisis is a devastating storm that has shown no signs of abating. Economies the world over remain in peril  and none is immune from the widening and deepening fallout of this systemic crisis of ill-regulated financial institutions and the movement of capital. The effects of the international global and financial meltdown are now being felt well beyond the bottom lines of multinational corporations. The macroeconomic and developmental consequences of this economic tornado are now painfully apparent  as is the terrible impact on the lives of individuals.  The economic crisis has spurred rising global unemployment and poverty  and has engendered a feeling of hopelessness  especially among young people. The continuing fallout of the economic upheaval can be felt in streets and cities around the world and is a major contributor to the global unrest that has pitted disgruntled youths and others in violent opposition to Government forces  from Tottenham to Tripoli. Social unrest elsewhere beckons  in dozens of countries where neither the socio-economic conditions nor the political institutions can contain the enormous pressures much longer.  Well into our third year of the international economic crisis  we can now declare that the tepid and timid responses of wealthy developed nations have failed to heal the global economy. The uncoordinated lurches from stimulus to austerity and back typify the confusion of the self-appointed premier forums of our international economic cooperation. The recovery that they prematurely declared was false and fleeting  and their counsel of patience and predictions of long-term recovery are cold comfort to the suffering peoples of countries that did not contribute to the crisis.  In small  vulnerable and highly indebted middle-income economies such as ours  the economic debacle threatens to have debilitating and ongoing consequences. We cannot afford to wait for the promise of incremental or cyclical up-ticks in the global economy. Small States need the fiscal and policy space to creatively spur development in ways that comply not with the checklists of discredited economic theorists  but with real-world particularities and people-centred policies. The international financial institutions have yet to sufficiently grasp this simple fact.  The General Assembly must reassert its role in the response to the international economic crisis. In the early days of the global economic deterioration  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines played a leading role in the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development. Under the President’s leadership  the Assembly must now meaningfully follow up on the unfulfilled recommendations and mechanisms spelled out at that    11-51360 18  Conference. The Caribbean region has a vested interest in this most urgent of matters.  This year  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was the subject of a United Nations resolution (65/136) that called upon the international community to provide assistance in the wake of Hurricane Tomas  which caused millions of dollars of damage in our region. While we are extremely grateful to the many countries that contributed generously to the emergency response  our national and regional recovery is far from complete. In the light of the welcome call by the President of the General Assembly to focus on disaster prevention and response during the current session  I remind the international community of our continuing recovery efforts and the ongoing vulnerability of small island developing States during the still active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season.  I remain baffled by the intransigence of major emitters and developed nations that refuse to shoulder the burden for arresting the climate changes that are linked to the excesses of their own wasteful policies. As Hurricanes Irene and Katia crept northward to typically untouched cities in the United States and the United Kingdom  we in the Caribbean felt saddened at the extensive damage and tragic loss of life  which is an annual occurrence in our region. We can only hope that our now-common experiences can engender a level of solidarity and constructive engagement that will lead to binding and meaningful emissions reduction targets and the fulfilment of commitments on adaptation financing for vulnerable small island developing States. Time is running out on the very existence of many countries in the face of rising oceans and increasingly intense storms.   I am heartened that the President of the General Assembly has decided to place special emphasis on sustainable development and global prosperity during the current session. But the citizens of the world  and indeed many of its Governments  have lost faith in endless self-important summits that produce little in the way of tangible results. The archives of the United Nations are filled with grandiloquent declarations and outcome documents from summits whose commitments were forgotten even before representatives had boarded their planes to return home from their exotic venues.  Next year  the issue of development returns to Latin America for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Brazil. Rio+20 will take place one decade after Mexico’s heralded Monterrey Consensus  in which developed countries committed themselves to the target of devoting 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance to developing countries. Today  even accepting the liberal definitions and creative accounting used by some States to measure development assistance  developed countries are contributing only 0.32 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance — less than half of the Monterrey target. We just have to make this better. We must do it right. It is just not good for us to be taken for a ride all of these years with all of these promises. It must come to an end sometime  and the world is changing. Let us get it right. It is our responsibility. Please.   In that regard  our dreams remain constantly unfulfilled. I am reminded of the poetic inquiry of Langston Hughes  an authentic voice of America  who asked simply this:  “What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore — And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over — like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?” Recent events in the streets of major cities around the world have probably answered Langston Hughes’ queries. Talk is cheap. We must get some action.   It should be a source of alarm and international embarrassment that the composition of the Security Council is an ossified relic of the Second World War  seemingly immune to the modern realities of new countries and new global Powers. It is an outrageous act of international irresponsibility that such an outmoded and increasingly illegitimate body is allowed to decisively insert itself into local and regional conflicts. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is adamant that the Security Council must be reformed  and that the reform must be underpinned by the expansion of the Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories alike  with full regard for the legitimate aspirations of Africa and the necessary accommodations for small island developing States    19 11-51360  which have valuable and creative perspectives on peacebuilding and conflict resolution.  The International Year for People of African Descent  which was declared with much fanfare  is almost at an end. I am grateful to the United Nations  which has hosted a number of events to raise awareness of the challenges facing people of African descent and foster discussions on potential solutions to tackle those challenges.  Racial discrimination was justified and itself became the justification for a brutal  exploitative and dehumanizing system. That system was perfected during the transatlantic slave trade and ingrained over the course of colonial domination. The structure of the modern world is still firmly rooted in a past of slavers and colonialist exploitation. Today  every single country of the world with a population of majority African descent is still trapped in the periphery of our global economic and developmental systems. The peoples of African descent remain disadvantaged  individually and systemically  by the entrenched and unyielding cycle of discrimination. Indeed  many of the wars that the United Nations struggles mightily to quell or avoid are rooted in the ignorant and avaricious cartography of the European colonizers.  The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have a long and proud history of resistance to slavery  bigotry and genocide  dating back to the heroic resistance of the Garifuna people against British aggression in the late 1700s. While we celebrate the noble heroism of the famous and the faceless alike who resisted racist colonial hegemony  we must continue to confront the legacy of this barbarism and continuing injustice. The wounds of that era are deep  the crimes against humanity are clear and the necessity for apology and reparations is undeniable; we cannot duck those. When we speak this year about the peoples of African descent  we must highlight what is happening in the Horn of Africa and in Haiti.   The collective voices of the international community are rising to a crescendo in support of full Palestinian statehood. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines echoes the relevant portions of yesterday’s Group of 77 ministerial declaration  which welcomed the State of Palestine’s application for full membership in the United Nations. The State of Palestine has brought its case to this world Assembly in keeping with the finest traditions of multilateralism. No one should call the Palestinian acts unilateral. They come here to the multilateral body. We have no doubt that its action and the solidarity of the international community will resuscitate the moribund negotiating process between the Palestinian and Israeli States.  As I reflect on the sweeping geopolitical changes being wrought in our global village  I am compelled to raise the fact that there is no practical  legal or logical justification for the seeming indifference of the United Nations to the meaningful participation of Taiwan in our important work. Surely  in the context of an ever-expanding and inclusive United Nations  the 23 million citizens of Taiwan can  at the very least  be allowed to meaningfully participate in the specialized agencies of the Organization — and that should extend beyond the World Trade Organization and the World Health Assembly.   Mr. Al-Nasser assumes the presidency amid a cyclone of international turbulence and change. We may not be able to direct those winds  but we can  and must  adjust our sails to harness the energy and the potential of this moment  while riding out the storms of uncertainty and upheaval. Former United States President Abraham Lincoln once said  in a different context:    “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty  and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new  so we must think anew and act anew.”  Our stormy present requires similar resolve  creativity and action. Let us rise to the occasion and fulfil the immense potential of this peaceful global Assembly. Into those swirling winds of change  let us raise the flag of inclusiveness  equality  peace  justice and development for all the peoples of the world to see. May Almighty God continue to bless us all.  The Acting President: On behalf of the General Assembly  I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has just made."
"185",7379,"VEN",66,2011,"It is almost the end of the beginning of the annual debate in United Nations. Having listened to and evaluated positions on different world issues debated by the planet and all of humanity  the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  the South American Bolivarian Republic  has received for the purposes of sharing with the Governments and the brotherly peoples of the world through the General Assembly a letter from the president of our Republic  Commander Hugo Chávez Frías. This letter contains a series of comments and reflections that are necessary and relevant for a democratic debate in our world and  above all  for the process of the growing empowerment of the peoples of the world and of transformation and necessary re-establishment of the United Nations as a multilateral system that has been with us for the last six or seven decades.  By your leave  Sir  I will read out and distribute to delegations the letter from Commander Hugo Chávez:   “Caracas  26 September 2011   “I am writing these words to the United Nations General Assembly  that great forum where representatives of all the peoples of the world meet to express the reality of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to justice  equality and peace.    “Peace  peace  peace … let us not look for peace in cemeteries  as Kant said with irony  but rather through the most zealous respect for international law. Unfortunately  the United Nations  throughout its history  instead of adding and multiplying efforts for peace among nations  has ended up by supporting the most ruthless injustices  sometimes by acts of commission  sometimes by acts of omission.    “We need to recall the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  which talks of saving future generations from the scourge of war. Those are just empty words; since 1945  the number of wars has continued to grow inexorably. Let us look once again at Libya in ruins  covered in blood  because of the powerful people in this world.    “I call on the Governments of the world to consider that since 11 September 2001  a new    11-51681 2  imperialist war was started  an unprecedented  permanent  perpetual war.   “We need to face the cruel reality of our world. We must make a list of our concerns stemming from the dangers and threats that are stalking us. Why is the United States the only country that sows military bases all over the world? What is it so afraid of that it must set aside staggering budgets for constantly increasing its military strength? Why has it unleashed so many wars  violating the sovereignty of other countries  which have the same rights over their futures? How can we can we use international law to counter its senseless ambition to militarily dominate the world in order to ensure access to the energy sources it needs to sustain its predatory consumerist model? Why does the United Nations do nothing to stop Washington?    “If we answer all of these questions with absolute sincerity  we would understand that the empire has crowned itself judge of the world  without anyone bestowing that responsibility on it and even though  therefore  the imperialist war is a threat to us all.    “Washington knows that a multipolar world is already an irreversible reality. Its strategy consists of halting the sustained rise of groups of emerging countries at any price  by promoting its major interests with its partners and followers in order to direct multi-polarity along the path that the empire wants. What is more  the goal is to reconfigure the world so that it sustains Yankee military hegemony. Humankind is facing a genuine threat of permanent war. As the case of Libya shows  the empire is ready  in any scenario  to create the political conditions for going to war. In the imperial worldview  Clausewitz’s famous axiom is being reversed: politics is the continuation of war by other means.   “What is behind this new Armageddon? It is the absolute power of the military-financial leadership  destroying the world in its accumulation of more profits  a military-financial leadership that is in fact subordinate to a group of States. It should be borne in mind that war is financial capital’s way of life: war that ruins most people and makes a few unimaginably rich. At this moment we have a profoundly serious threat to global peace: the unleashing of a new cycle of colonial wars  starting with Libya  with the cynical goal of breathing new life into the global capitalist system  whose current structural crisis has still in no way curbed its destructive  consumerist voraciousness. The case of Libya should alert us to the desire to practice a new imperial version of colonialism: military interventionism endorsed by the anti-democratic bodies of the United Nations and justified by prefabricated lies.   “Humankind is on the brink of an unimaginable catastrophe. The world is marching inexorably towards devastating ecocide; the terrifying consequences of global warming proclaim it  but the ideology of the environmental equivalents of Cortés and Pizarro  the early Spanish colonizers who destroyed part of the American continent — as the influential French thinker Edgar Morin has said — drives them to continue their depredations and destruction. The energy and food crises worsen  while capitalism still breaches every boundary with impunity.   “As we face this bleak prospect  our way is lighted by the great American scientist and two-time Nobel prize winner  Linus Pauling  who said:    ‘I believe that there is a greater power in the world than the evil power of military force  of nuclear bombs — there is the power of good  of morality  of humanitarianism. I believe in the power of the human spirit’.  Then let us mobilize all the power of the human spirit; it is time. We must unleash a great political counter-offensive to prevent the powers of darkness finding justification for going to war  so they can unleash the generalized global war with which they hope to save the West’s capital. Venezuela calls for the establishment of a grand alliance against war and for peace  with the supreme goal of avoiding war at all costs. The warmongers and  especially  the military-financial leadership that sponsors and leads them must be defeated politically. Let us build the balanced universe envisioned by the liberator Simón Bolivar  the balance that  as he said    3 11-51681  cannot be found in war; the balance born out of peace.   “Let us take note and remember: Venezuela  along with the member countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  actively advocated for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the Libyan conflict  as did the African Union. Eventually  however  the logic of war decreed by the Security Council and made a reality by NATO  the armed wing of the Yankee empire  was imposed  the logic of war whose vanguard is the transnational media.   “Let us remember that the case of Libya was brought before the Security Council on the basis of intense propaganda on the part of the media  which lied in saying that the Libyan Air Force was bombing innocent civilians  not to mention the grotesque media setting of Tripoli’s Green Square. This premeditated campaign of lies was used to justify hasty and irresponsible decisions by the Security Council  paving the way for NATO’s policy of military regime change in Libya. It is worth asking: what became of the no-fly zone established by Security Council resolution 1973 (2011)? How could the more than 20 000 NATO missions flown against Libya  many of them aimed at bombing the Libyan people  not represent the denial of the no-fly zone? Once the Libyan Air Force was completely annihilated  the continued ‘humanitarian’ bombing showed that the West  through NATO  is imposing its interests on North Africa  turning Libya into a colonial protectorate.   “It is a joke to say that the United Nations imposed an arms embargo on Libya  when NATO itself brought in thousands of heavy weapons in support of a violent insurrection against that country’s legitimate Government. The embargo  of course  was there only to prevent the Libyan Government from defending its sovereignty  exposing yet again the functioning of the cruel international system  under which the law applies only to the weak.   “What is the real reason for this military intervention? To recolonize Libya so as to take over its wealth. We have no doubt about that. Everything else is subordinate to that goal. No one colonizes innocently  as the great poet of Martinique  Aimé Césaire  rightly said in his extraordinary essay on colonialism. By the way  the residence of Venezuela’s Ambassador in Tripoli was invaded and looted while the United Nations stayed mute  guarding a shameful silence.   “We demand the immediate cessation of the bombing on Libyan territory. We will also continue demanding that international law be respected in the case of this sister nation. We will not remain silent in the face of evil intentions to destroy the foundations that endow it with sense and reason. We therefore put this question to the Assembly: Why is the Libyan seat in the United Nations granted to the so called National Transitional Council while Palestine’s admission is blocked by ignoring not only its legitimate aspiration  but also the will of the majority of the General Assembly? With all its strength and with the moral authority granted it by the will of the majority of the world’s peoples  Venezuela hereby affirms its unconditional solidarity with the Palestinian people and its unlimited support for the Palestinian national cause  including  of course  the immediate admission of Palestine to the United Nations as a full Member State.   “And the same imperialist formula is being repeated in the case of Syria. Had not some of the Security Council’s permanent members stood firm  it would all have ended with the Council authorizing NATO to fire its missiles and send its bombers against Syria. It is intolerable that the Powers of this world wish to arrogate to themselves the right to order legitimate  sovereign rulers to resign on the spot. Having succeeded in Libya  they wish to proceed in the same way against Syria. Such are the current asymmetries that exist on the international scene  and such are the abuses done to independent nations.   “It is not for us to pass judgement on Syria’s domestic situation  first  because of the inherent complexity of any national reality  and secondly  because only the Syrian people can solve their problems and decide their fate by the right to self-determination of all peoples  an inalienable right in every sense. But that does not prevent us from believing that it is 100 times better to bet on the success of the broad national    11-51681 4  dialogue for which President Basher Al-Assad has called than to impose sanctions and howl like hyenas for military intervention. We fully support the efforts of President Al-Assad to preserve the stability and unity of his country  which is being besieged by the West.    “Now let us turn to the Horn of Africa  where we will witness a heartbreaking example of the United Nations’ historic failure. Most serious news agencies report that 20 000 to 29 000 children under the age of five have died in the last three months.   “The journalist Frida Modak  in her article ‘To Die In Somalia’ reveals the miserliness that afflicts the major international organizations  first among them the United Nations  a level of poverty worse than that ravaging the vast region of the Horn of Africa.   “In order to confront this situation  we need $1.4 billion  not to solve the problem but to address the emergency that Somalia  Kenya  Djibouti and Ethiopia are going through. According to all information received  the next two months will be decisive if we are to prevent the death of more than 12 million people. That situation is most acute in Somalia.   “We must also ask ourselves how much money is being spent on sophisticated weapons to destroy Libya. Here is the answer of United States Congressman Dennis Kucinich  who says  ‘This new war will cost us $500 million during its first week alone. Obviously  we do not have financing resources for that and we will end up cutting off other important domestic programs’ funding’. According to Mr. Kucinich himself  the amount spent in northern Africa during the first three weeks to massacre the Libyan people could have been used to help the entire Horn of Africa  saving dozens of thousands of lives.   “The reasons behind the criminal military engagement in Libya are not humanitarian at all. They are based on the Malthusian postulate that there are simply too many people in the world and that they have to be eliminated by generating more hunger  destruction and uncertainty  thereby creating more financial profits.    “In this regard  it is frankly regrettable that the opening address of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly did not include an immediate appeal to solve the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa  even as it asserted that the time had come to act on Syria. What criminal cynicism!   “We also call for an end to the shameful criminal blockade against our sister republic of Cuba  imposed by the United States empire for more than 50 years with gruesome cruelty against the heroic people of José Martí. By 2010  a total of 19 separate votes in the General Assembly articulated the universal demand that the United States cease its economic and trade blockade against Cuba.    “Since all arguments of international good sense have been exhausted  we have no choice but to believe that such aggravated cruelty against the Cuban Revolution is the result of imperial arrogance in the face of the dignity and courage shown by the defiant Cuban people in their sovereign decision to determine their own fate and fight for their happiness.   “In Venezuela  we believe that the time has come to demand that the United States not only immediately and unconditionally end the criminal blockade it has imposed against the Cuban people  but that it also release the five Cuban anti-terrorist fighters held hostage in the prisons of the empire solely for seeking to prevent illegal actions that terrorist groups are preparing against Cuba  under the protection of the Government of the United States.   “We wish to reiterate that it is impossible to ignore the crisis in the United Nations. In 2005  before this very General Assembly  we declared that the model of the United Nations was obsolete. Back then  we also said that it needed to be rebuilt from the ground up  and that the process could not be postponed.   “Since then  nothing has been done. The political will of the most powerful has prevailed. Of course  the United Nations  as it continues to function  docilely serves their interests. If its Secretary-General  along with the President of the International Criminal Court  takes part in an act of war  as is the case with Libya  then nothing can   5 11-51681  be expected from the current structure of this Organization  and there is no longer time for reform. The United Nations does not accept any reform whatsoever. The illness within it is fatal.   “It is unbearable that there is a Security Council that turns its back  whenever it wants to  on the clamour of a majority of nations  deliberately refusing to acknowledge the will of the General Assembly. If the Security Council is a kind of club with privileged members  what can the General Assembly do? What is the scope of its operation when its members violate international law?   “Paraphrasing the liberator Simón Bolívar  who was referring specifically  in 1818  to the then newborn Yankee imperialism  we have had enough of laws being applied by the weak and abuses being committed by the strong. The peoples of the South cannot be the ones to respect international law  while the North violates  destroys and plunders us.   “If we do not commit ourselves once and for all to restructuring the United Nations  this Organization will definitively lose its last shred of credibility. Its crisis of legitimacy is accelerating toward a final implosion. In fact  that is what happened to its immediate predecessor: the League of Nations.   “A crucial and decisive first step towards restructuring the United Nations would be to eliminate the category of permanent member along with the right to veto in the Security Council. Likewise  the decision-making power of the General Assembly must be democratically maximized. A comprehensive review of the Charter of the United Nations is also urgently required  with the aim of drafting a new Charter.   “The future of a peaceful  multipolar world depends on the determination of the majority of the world’s people to defend ourselves from the new colonialism and to achieve a balance in the universe that will be capable of neutralizing imperialism and its arrogance.   “This broad  generous  respectful and inclusive call is addressed to all the peoples of the world  but most especially to the emerging Powers of the South  which must courageously rise to the role they are being asked to play.    “From Latin America and the Caribbean  a powerful dynamic of regional alliances has emerged that seeks to create a democratic space that will be respectful of differences and eager to emphasize solidarity and complementarity in order to maximize that which unites us and resolve politically whatever divides us.    “This new regionalism allows for diversity and respects everyone’s rhythms. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America is growing into an experimental vanguard of progressive and anti-imperialist Governments  seeking ways to break with the prevailing international order and strengthening the people’s capacity to confront the de facto Powers. However  that does not prevent its members from contributing decisively and enthusiastically to the consolidation of the Union of South American Nations  a political bloc that federates 12 sovereign States of South America into what the liberator Simón Bolívar called ‘a Nation of Republics’. Furthermore  the 33 countries that comprise Latin America and the Caribbean are currently preparing to take the historic step of establishing a single great regional entity that unites us all  without exception  through which we will be able to design policies that will ensure our well-being  our independence and our sovereignty  based on equality  solidarity  and reciprocity.    “Caracas  the capital of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  is proud to be able to host  on 2 and 3 December of this year  the summit of heads of State and Government that will definitely establish the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.   “The people of Venezuela have placed their hopes in a broad alliance of regional assemblies of the South  such as the Union of South American Nations  the Caribbean Community  the Central American Integration System  the African Union  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Economic Cooperation Organization  among other regional organizations  and specifically in interregional coordinating bodies of emerging Powers such as    11-51681 6  the BRICS group — consisting of Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa — which must become a focus of attention in coordination with the peoples of the South.   “I would like to conclude by recalling the great Venezuelan singer Ali Primera  whose poetic voice sent a message of life and revolution to our people. In one of his songs  he asks: what is man’s struggle to achieve peace? And what kind of peace would it be  if we were to leave the world as it is? Today more than ever  the worst crime against peace would be to leave the world as it is; if we were to do so  the present and the future would be characterized by unending war. Bringing about peace  on the other hand  requires a radical rejection of everything that prevents humankind from being human.”"
"186",7418,"VNM",66,2011,"On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that your diplomatic skills and experience will help to ensure the great success of the current session. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his significant contributions to the fruitful outcome of the sixty-fifth session.    11-51670 26   The Vietnamese delegation also wishes to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. We believe that  with the cooperation of Member countries  the Secretary-General will make ever greater contributions to the operations of the United Nations and  thus  to global peace and development. We most warmly welcome the Republic of South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the Organization.  Today  peace  cooperation and development remain the over-arching themes of our time. Yet tensions and conflicts persist in most continents and regions  owing to unresolved differences within nations and the threat and use of force. Climate change  natural disasters  pandemics  transnational crime  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism are still the challenges that demand effective responses. The world economy’s unstable recovery  coupled with economic downturns in many developed nations  has exposed developing countries to the risks of even more unequal terms of trade  rising protectionism  dwindling financial resources and the erosion of gains relating to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Multilateral negotiations on issues of common interest  such as disarmament and climate change  have not yielded results that meet our expectations.  The current situation compels nations to promote dialogue and cooperation so as to surmount common challenges  man-made and natural alike. Peace  security and stability remain the intense desire of all nations and are prerequisites for development. The key to success lies in each nation’s own efforts  as well as in enhanced international cooperation and multilateralism based on respect for the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations  while taking into account the legitimate interests of all countries  especially developing ones. In that regard  Viet Nam commends you  Mr. President  on the theme that you have proposed for the general debate  namely  the peaceful settlement of disputes.  As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General  never has the United Nations been so relevant and so urgently needed by so many people around the world. It must deliver concrete results that make a real difference in the daily lives of the world’s people. With its universal membership  the Organization undoubtedly enjoys a unique legitimacy and should thus be at the forefront of global governance and multilateral cooperation.  Over the past several years  the United Nations has played a crucial role in ending conflicts and promoting peace processes in various regions. We deeply value the initiatives that place the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable at the centre of the international agenda  as well as initiatives to mobilize resources and capacities to fulfil internationally agreed action plans  including the MDGs; facilitate multilateral negotiations on climate change  as well as on disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; provide solutions to such pressing issues as desertification  non-communicable diseases  nuclear safety and security; and respond to the global financial and economic crisis. We cannot help mentioning the efforts of the United Nations funds  programmes and specialized agencies to establish norms and set agendas in accordance with their mandates  so as to assist developing countries in their development endeavours.  At the same time  the international community looks to the Organization as a source of inspiration and strength  as a universal organization that can act decisively to counter any tendency that may undermine its credibility or contradict its fundamental values and founding purposes and principles. The Organization is therefore expected to uphold the values of peace and security  international law and multilateralism. It is also expected to become more responsive and effective on the ground  with the ultimate objective of better serving the needs and interests of Member States  in particular the developing countries.  As world peace and security are always our top priority  the United Nations should continue its concerted and coherent efforts to promote the peaceful settlement of civil wars and local conflicts in various regions of the world  especially those in North Africa and the Middle East  while preventing others from erupting.   We must cultivate a culture of peace and dialogue and promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. In that regard  Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence and strengthen national reconstruction and reconciliation in Afghanistan and Iraq. As regards Palestine’s application for full membership in the United Nations Organization  Viet Nam wishes to underline the fact that we recognized the State of Palestine in 1988. We   27 11-51670  have always supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people for their inalienable rights  including the right to establish an independent and sovereign State that coexists peacefully with Israel with the pre-June 1967 borders. In that spirit  we affirm our strong support for Palestine’s efforts to soon become a full United Nations Member.  We support United Nations efforts to translate the outcomes of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the recently concluded High-level Meeting on nuclear safety and security into concrete results. We also support the Organization’s efforts to revitalize the work of the Conference on Disarmament and move multilateral disarmament negotiations forwards.  In parallel with security concerns  the international community  with the United Nations at the centre  should work for more equal international relations  a fairer international economic and financial architecture and more just institutions. Developing countries must have a greater role and say in international governance. They should be enabled to take part in the globalization process in a more proactive and effective manner. Developed countries  for their part  should deliver on their obligations and commitments  including the maintenance of macroeconomic stability  contribution to the successful conclusion of the Doha Round  the elimination of unfair trade measures and an increase in development assistance.   Given the continued need to draw on the thinking and action towards a more stable and healthy global economic environment  we wish to recommend that the United Nations convene a meeting in the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council to follow up the Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303)  which was held in June 2009.  In the meantime  the United Nations should undertake measures to prevent the unilateral use of economic means against developing countries. Viet Nam strongly calls for an end to the economic embargo against the Republic of Cuba.  Moreover  to promote inclusive and sustainable development  political commitment and efforts  with the central coordinating role played by the United Nations  must be doubled for the attainment of equitable and sustainable development for all. Four years from the agreed target date of 2015  it is essential that the global partnership for development be expanded  both in breadth and depth  so as to provide countries in need with relevant policy experience  resources and best practices to achieve the MDGs and maintain the process thereof.   Equally important is to begin developing a vision for a global development platform for the post-2015 period. We must also work much harder together to ensure the fruitful outcomes of the forthcoming seventeenth session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in South Africa and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil.  Viet Nam is committed to working with other Member States to revitalize the General Assembly as the principal deliberative  policymaking and representative organ  to enhance the overarching role of the Economic and Social Council in the development sphere  and to enlarge Security Council membership and improve its working methods. We also look forward to more coherent  consistent and effective development activities of the United Nations system so as to align them effectively with the national priorities of recipient countries. In an effort to contribute to United Nations reforms  Viet Nam has been active in implementing the Delivering as One initiative and  together with the United Nations and other partners  has made tangible progress.  Viet Nam welcomes the adoption of resolution 65/281 on the review of the Human Rights Council. We wish to stress that the operation of the Human Rights Council and other United Nations human rights mechanisms should continue to be improved in order to become more effective  consistent and efficient  while focusing more on dialogue and experience-sharing. To further contribute to that end  we have presented Viet Nam’s candidature for membership of the Human Rights Council for the term 2013-2016.  The year 2011 is important for Viet Nam since we have successfully organized the eleventh party congress and the elections of State bodies. We have also adopted a socio-economic development strategy for the next decade. During the past 25 years of comprehensive renewal  Viet Nam has made significant achievements in many aspects and the country has    11-51670 28  integrated extensively into international life. We have managed to establish and strengthen stable and long-term frameworks of relations with major countries and global and regional economic and political centres.   Building on those achievements  in the coming period  Viet Nam is determined to comprehensively step up the renewal process  with higher quality and effectiveness  as well as national industrialization and modernization  in combination with the development of a knowledge-based economy.  In an effort to broaden and deepen our relations with other countries  Viet Nam will continue an independent foreign policy for peace  cooperation and development. Viet Nam is a reliable friend and partner  as well as a responsible member of the international community  working for the prosperity of every nation  national independence  global peace  democracy and social progress.   We shall enhance international integration and proactively participate in and contribute to regional and international multilateral forums  such as the United Nations  the Asia-Europe Meeting  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China  on solving global issues of nuclear security  nuclear disarmament  crime prevention  climate change  sustainable development and cooperation on the Mekong River.   Furthermore  we are always willing to share with other countries our experiences in South-South and tripartite cooperation  financing for development  enhancing aid effectiveness and mainstreaming the MDGs into national socio-economic strategies.  We shall work closely with the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other stakeholders for peace  stability  cooperation and development in South-East Asia  East Asia and beyond through ASEAN-led mechanisms and instruments  such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia  the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone  the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit.  In that regard  Viet Nam welcomes and supports contributions to peace and security in the Eastern Sea. Like other ASEAN members  Viet Nam is strongly committed to dialogue and confidence-building mechanisms and stands ready to support and participate in any effort to find peaceful settlements to disputes  in accordance with international law  including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  and that are acceptable to all parties concerned. Pending such a solution  we will  along with the parties concerned  strictly observe the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the Eastern Sea. We welcome the stated commitments to working together towards the conclusion of a code of conduct in the foreseeable future.  This year’s session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial juncture as the world is faced with daunting challenges. It is my firm belief that only by undertaking joint efforts and enhancing multilateral cooperation could we meet the expectations and aspirations of our peoples and manage to set out the right direction for the long-term development of the United Nations. Viet Nam remains strongly committed to that endeavour."
"187",7449,"VUT",66,2011,"Vanuatu joins other delegations in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation vows our full cooperation  and believes that  with your leadership  we will conclude a successful session.   9 11-51372   Allow me to also acknowledge the leadership of your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss  for his exceptional guidance and for the considerable and important achievements of the previous Assembly session.  In the same spirit  on behalf of my Government  I take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to the post of Secretary-General and to commend him on his vision  leadership and tireless efforts in moving towards achieving the common interests of all humanity.  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and the people of the Republic of South Sudan on the birth of their new nation on 9 July. Vanuatu recognizes the sovereignty of South Sudan  and offers the young nation our full support.   The theme of this year’s General Assembly session  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  calls for more creative and feasible peaceful multilateral solutions to many of our long-standing disputes that  unless resolved peacefully  will have far more extensive global consequences. The settlement of disputes by peaceful means is central to the United Nations system  as enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in numerous international conventions and treaties. In that context  we  like many others  encourage our brothers and sisters in Israel and Palestine to continue the peaceful negotiations that will ensure regional and global stability. We also call upon the United Nations to visit the framework with which it fulfils its mediation mandates and to develop closer partnerships with mediation actors within regional groups. To succeed as responsible nations of this global village  we must continue to cultivate an environment that thwarts the seeds of bitterness  hatred and vengeance.  In establishing the United Nations in 1945  many nations  great and small  entrusted it with the responsibility to assist in maintaining international peace and security  developing friendly relations among nations  and promoting social progress  better living standards and human rights. However  66 years after the founding of this multilateral Organization  the world that we live in is far from the ideals for which its inception was intended. Across the globe  people from all walks of life continue to be subject to colonial rule  death threats  arbitrary detention  torture and worse  and are killed for exercising their rights to freedom of expression. Untold crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities still continue.  While we reaffirm our faith in multilateralism  with the conviction that bilateral diplomacy cannot substitute for multilateralism  we also believe that our nations have a greater need of a more robust multilateral system that is swift and efficient in responding to the multitude of challenges that members of this highly esteemed system  acting unilaterally  would be hard done to defeat. We are delighted to note that one of the four priorities of the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session is to continue the work on the reforms within the United Nations.  In that context  this year’s establishment of the Change Management Team within the Organization  in particular  is a step in the right direction. That initiative comes at a time when members of this body are calling on the United Nations to play a more prominent role in a period of rapid change and financial restraint in building a culture of transparency  accountability  good governance and enhanced democratic participation  and to achieve efficiency and results.  As regards the Security Council  Vanuatu is steadfast in its belief that reform measures must provide for democratic and geographically strategic representation in both the permanent and the non-permanent membership to reflect the realities of this century. We continue to lend our invaluable support to the candidacies of the many countries vying for membership within the non-permanent seat category of the Security Council. We hope that sustained reforms will help to boost the Security Council’s peacekeeping role and to increase efficiency and transparency in promoting the universal standards and common values and customs that form the basis of global security and development. At this juncture  let me acknowledge the work of the peacekeeping and nation-building missions of the United Nations in supporting new countries  such as Timor-Leste  South Sudan and others  in their nation-building.  On 9 September 2011  we marked the tenth anniversary of the twin towers bombing that wreaked havoc in the city of New York and claimed more than 3 000 lives. Such acts of terrorism can never be justified  whatever the causes they claim to be    11-51372 10  advancing and to whatever grievances they claim to respond.  Despite international efforts to counter terrorism  major threats remain. Indeed  the world cannot sit idly by  watching the forces of evil threaten humanity’s right to peace and security. Terrorism cannot and must not be allowed to flourish. Vanuatu condemns  in the strongest possible terms  all forms and manifestations of terrorism  and calls on all countries to join forces to fight against its evil ideologies  activities and financing in order to make the world of tomorrow a safer place. All countries must work closely in eliminating that scourge.  Today  the lack of progress on disarmament and non-proliferation  cornerstones of global security  is disturbing. The world’s nuclear Powers must fulfil their vows to meet their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to take decisive and practical steps towards irreversible disarmament. Only then will the proliferation of arms reverse.  My people welcome the strenuous efforts of President Obama and other world leaders  working together at the vanguard to advance negotiations on denuclearization. The very recent events in Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster clearly show that whatever safeguards are in place  there can be no absolute guarantee that those can withstand the unforgivable ferocity of Mother Nature. They are important lessons for us.  Four years after the global financial crisis began  in 2007  the economies of many developed countries continue to struggle  stirring financial markets worldwide with fresh fears of impediments  default and possible recession. For small developing countries  such as Vanuatu  the rise in food prices  high fuel costs  soaring commodity prices  fears of a global recession  as well as the other unforeseen effects of the global financial instability and uncertainty that remain in many developed countries  are having multifaceted consequences.  Such developments  coupled with the ongoing effects of climate change and natural disasters  continue to threaten the economies of small island nations  and to undermine all efforts towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure that sustainable development is achieved.  Vanuatu has made some progress towards achieving the MDGs  but much more needs to be done by pooling our own resources at the national level and by engaging the international community in coordinating efforts so as to achieve our MDGs.  The convening of this year’s thematic group on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is indeed timely. In my country  it is estimated that approximately 75 per cent of deaths each year are related to NCDs. Furthermore  the immediate causes of the NCD epidemic — tobacco use  unhealthy diets  physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol — are becoming increasingly widespread in our society  especially in urban areas. Those self-inflicted diseases are  therefore  becoming a major barrier to our socio-economic development and to achieving healthy islands and the MDGs.   At this point in time  my country is undertaking  for the first time  a national NCD STEPS survey to determine and to better understand the burden and the extent of NCDs and their determinants in our communities so that we can better target our intervention efforts in future. Early this year  Vanuatu launched its revised NCD strategy and policy for the period 2011 to 2016 to guide our implementation efforts in the coming years. We have also implemented  over the years  many key NCD strategies to empower our people to increase control over their health and its determinants  with the assistance of our development partners  such as the World Health Organization  the Australian Agency for International Development and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.  In terms of economic performance  Vanuatu’s economy grew at an unprecedented average rate of 6 per cent between 2003 and 2008. Economic growth has since weakened  mainly as a result of exogenous shocks felt during the ongoing global financial crisis. That has had a negative impact on Government revenue in the past few years  adding further strain on the economy. That said  the need for significant increases in financial support from development partners remains pressing. The announcement of a considerable increase in credit facilities at the Group of Twenty London summit in 2009 was welcome news. However  the reassertion of those financial commitments and swift action need to be rigorously followed up by the donor community.   11 11-51372   The previous assessment by the United Nations Committee for Development Policy of Vanuatu’s development status as a least developed country has showed a progressive pace in development. While graduation may be imminent  I must underscore  before the Assembly  that most challenges of the small island developing States are permanent. The challenges of smallness  the distance to major metropolitan markets  extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change  the sea-level rise and vulnerability to tsunamis all constitute permanent characteristics of our island nations. It is therefore important for the United Nations to ensure that multilateral mechanisms for graduation and a transition package must not be detached from those permanent realities. We are delighted that the President of the General Assembly has vowed to pay special attention to vulnerable States such as ours.  Climate change and ocean acidification remain the single greatest threat to the livelihoods  security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific  particularly for small low-lying Pacific islands. High greenhouse gas emitting industrialized countries must start to embrace and to accept the common but differentiated responsibilities in historic contributions to climate change.  As the former Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum  I  along with my fellow leaders of the Pacific Island nations  particularly welcome the historic visit of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Pacific. I call on the United Nations to undertake more senior missions to the Pacific region so as to establish a more comprehensive understanding of how susceptible the people of the Pacific are to the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-level rise  as embodied by the case of Kiribati.  I call on leaders of advanced nations to renew and honour their pledges to finance  in particular  efforts to help the most vulnerable communities to address their adaptation needs in order to ensure that island nations survive the impending global disaster that climate change may afford. An increased global fund to strengthen the capacity-building efforts of vulnerable communities  in particular  to integrate climate change into economic policies and actions  is pressing.  As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 17) talks in Durban  my Government urges all delegations to work tirelessly to pledge to a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Durban must advance all aspects of the climate change negotiations and devise strategies to operationalize the COP 16 decisions if any concrete  balanced and ambitious outcomes are to yield results.  Colonialism and all forms of imperialism must be addressed by the United Nations  for one of the reasons why the United Nations system was created was to develop friendly relations among nations  based on respect for the principles of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples. Therefore  colonial rule is obsolete and must be addressed with new drive and vision. The United Nations  as well as the international community  must continue in their efforts to address issues of decolonization in those Non-Self-Governing Territories that still yearn for freedom.   The mandate of the Special Committee on Decolonization must be strengthened. All means should be accorded to the Committee to allow it to magnify the suppressed voices of the peoples in all Non-Self-Governing Territories that are still under the control of administrative Powers  especially where serious human rights violations are reported.  My country  Vanuatu  was the last in the Pacific region to be decolonized. Since our independence in 1980  we have continued to speak out for the inalienable rights of the colonized indigenous peoples of Oceania and in certain parts of the Asian region  where either administrative or colonial Powers still retain authority.  My Government also calls upon the United Nations to ensure that the demands for French Polynesia’s right to self-determination are not rejected. We  along with many other Pacific island nations  support calls for the reinstatement of the French-administered Territory with the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization. That would be the first major step in the process of their self-determination. Vanuatu encourages the French-administered Territory of French Polynesia and  in the same spirit  that of New Caledonia to continue to seek meaningful dialogue with France in order to find ways to ensure that the freedom of the colonized peoples of Oceania is fully realized.  Enshrined in the core principles of the United Nations Charter  the Organization must guarantee universal respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the oppressed. The universal pursuit of    11-51372 12  democratic reform  good governance and adherence to human rights conventions have often concealed the suffering of many people  denying them their right to decide their destiny without fear or reprisal. The United Nations must step up its efforts to exercise their freedom from the tentacles of foreign rule  so troublesome a misgiving in these modern times.  One day  all the indigenous peoples of Oceania and beyond must reach their goal of freedom  a destination promised to all humanity and a right that the Creator endowed upon all peoples and that no earthly Power can deny  to determine where they live and to be self-ruled in free association with the international community of nations.  Let me take this opportunity once again to reiterate to this eminent Assembly our serious concerns over the infringement by foreign forces on the political freedom of many of our nations today  a right denied to the people of the land to exercise their freedom to control their lands  a freedom denied by the injustices of the global world order that demarcated many of our lands  dividing peoples  families and cultures and disconnecting us from the traditions of our ancestors. Denying the right of a country to exercise its political freedom over its maritime territorial boundaries and preventing the indigenous people of a country from exercising their culture and traditional linkages with integral part of its lands  sovereign since time immemorial  remain one of the greatest crimes of our times. We are therefore calling on the United Nations to ensure that our fundamental rights can be exercised in all parts of our territory.  As the world unites in addressing some of the major challenges of our times  the lifting of the economic embargo on Cuba is long overdue. Denying the good people of Cuba from fully participating in the global economy is inhumane. T is high time that the Cuban people be allowed to enjoy their rights and freedom as an independent and sovereign nation.  It is time that we all revisit the aspirations and the ideals with which the United Nations system was created and join forces to weed out injustice  colonialism  poverty  hunger  war crimes  terrorism and the like in the hope of creating a peaceful and secure world for generations to come. All nations  great and small  must respect each other’s sovereignty  for that is the way to achieve trust and to ensure a dignified confidence among all friends gathered around the table of the United Nations.  I also welcome Fiji’s commitment to full and democratic elections by September 2014. As a Pacific neighbour  such as announcement is timely.  In conclusion  I wish to take this final opportunity to express my gratitude to Vanuatu’s development partners for the support that they provide in building our economy. I believe that more can be done to help small vulnerable island countries like Vanuatu to address the rising challenges confronting them.  Leaders of the world  the resounding echoes of history drum in our ears and remind us of what must be done tomorrow. The global forces driving the changes that will shape our future must beckon towards a world where people of all races  ethnicities  creeds  beliefs  faiths  cultures  traditions and origins can live in harmony and peace  as brothers and sisters."
"188",7481,"WSM",66,2011,"Samoa joined the United Nations 35 years ago  a decision rooted firmly in our belief in the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member States  each with the same rights and responsibilities. That sentiment underpins our    11-51372 6  relationship with our Organization as it evolves into a global family of interdependent nations.  The Organization remains one of the last  if not the greatest  bastion against the serious challenges and uncertainties that beset our world — financial and economic crises  climate change  environmental degradation  land desertification  ocean acidification  destruction of fishery resources  endemic poverty and dangerous threats to peace and security. That is why we continue to support the United Nations and look to its timely interventions and leadership in addressing the challenges the world faces and finding collective solutions to them.  It is in the context of the leadership role of the United Nations that the visit of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon earlier this month to the Pacific region as a special guest of the Pacific Leaders Forum in New Zealand was particularly significant. The visit enabled the Secretary-General to see first-hand the scale of the challenges facing vulnerable Pacific small island countries. The visit  the first ever to the Pacific by an incumbent Secretary-General in the 66 years of existence of the United Nations  was a historical milestone in the relationship between the Pacific region and the United Nations. The fact that the Secretary-General is from the Asia-Pacific region and that the visit took place before the start of his second term  not at the end of it  are positive aspects that were not lost on the Pacific leaders. Mr. Ban Ki-moon’s advocacy and support of Pacific issues in the different international forums dealing with sustainable development  climate change and peace and security  as we witnessed on Wednesday when he presented his report to the General Assembly  will be invaluable in placing Pacific concerns at centre stage for attention and support where needed.  The United Nations is the world’s premier Organization. Its role in the various areas of development and in improving the human condition must be exemplary and unequivocal. The work and influence of the United Nations to encourage Governments to respect and uphold fundamental human rights is sorely needed in parts of our Pacific region and across the world.  In our region as well  the work of the United Nations to facilitate the choices of Pacific peoples to exercise their right to self-determination continues to form an important part of our Pacific region’s association with the United Nations. In this respect  we strongly urge the United Nations to play a more proactive role towards the achievement of this goal.  Development  security and human rights are mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations. Equal progress on all three fronts should be the norm  not the exception. A decade into the new millennium  we find the Assembly meeting against the backdrop of a world teetering on many fronts and replete with uncertainties.  A full recovery of the global economy to pre-2008 levels continues to be an elusive goal. The immediate to medium-term outlook is not promising and does not instil confidence. While some Governments are being assisted with their budgetary difficulties  others  in contrast  are struggling on their own to provide the basic necessities for their people. Achieving the time-bound Millennium Development Goals in their totality is becoming difficult by the day.  In terms of crises  be it economic  climate change or food-related  the most and worst affected by any one of these are  without exception  some of the United Nations — recognized vulnerable groups — the least developed countries and the small island developing States. Samoa belongs to both categories. Though the United Nations has committed  through internationally agreed development frameworks such as the Brussels Programme of Action  the Barbados Programme of Action and others  to help vulnerable economies attain economic growth  sustainable development and the resilience to endure external shocks  the reality is that the needs of these groups always outstrip the resources available to them. This mismatch is due in part to undercapitalized frameworks with no dedicated funding.  Earlier this week  the United Nations focused long-overdue attention on the insidious health threat posed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). If left unchecked  NCDs will not only devastate the health of our people but also have the potential to wreak havoc in our economies  with the incidence of these so-called lifestyle diseases having a heavy impact on the productive population. Samoa therefore adds its voice to the call to include the reduction of non-communicable diseases in the Millennium Development Goals and which sufficient resources and donor partnership actions should also prioritize.   7 11-51372   These are real concerns. Sustainable economic development is a priority issue for Samoa and the Pacific island countries. This is why we are hopeful that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  to be held next June in Brazil  will allow for a serious discussion and reorientation of the whole United Nations community on the importance of identifying and providing the necessary resources for the implementation of the agreed programmes of action and other global arrangements that the United Nations underwrites.  The theme of this year’s Pacific Forum was “Converting potential into prosperity”. In line with this is the advocacy led by the Pacific countries to raise the profile of the oceans agenda towards a strong “blue economy” outcome  to ensure that the importance of the oceans to our islands is captured as an integral component of the Rio+20 outcome. The ocean provides the Pacific region with opportunities and challenges  best reflected in the four-pronged focus on conservation  sustainable management  balanced harvesting and greater economic return from the utilization of fishery and marine resources.  The emphasis of efforts on maximizing economic benefits from fisheries is a recognition of its vital contribution in supporting sustainable economic development and attempts to address the long-held concern of Pacific islands that they have been for far too long short-changed and unfairly compensated for the fishery resources found within our waters  which are worth many billions of dollars  with less than 1 per cent received by the island countries.  The Pacific States have long been committed to efforts to conserve and manage fisheries resources in the region. It has therefore also been a point of long-standing frustration that vessels of major fishing nations continue to fish illegally in Pacific waters. Even when they are caught carrying out illegal fishing activities  it is by no means a certainty that prosecution and enforcement of penalties will be successful  when infringing fishing vessels have heavy financial resources backing their defences.  We therefore again urge cooperation from all nations with fishing fleets in the Pacific to work together with our Pacific countries to stop illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing practices in the Pacific. The Pacific carries the last major stocks of some key fish species that in other oceans have already been depleted  contaminated and devastated. Successful conservation and the effective management of harvest levels in the long term is absolutely critical  not just for Pacific countries and distant-water fishing nations  but  ultimately  the availability of fish supplies to the rest of the world in the years ahead. The successful conservation and management of fish stocks in the Pacific is  pure and simple  good business for everyone.  Climate change was again singled out by Pacific leaders during their just-concluded summit as the single greatest threat to the livelihoods  security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Natural catastrophes are capable of destruction that devastates entire communities. From the tragic experiences that our country has endured  we know of the great pain from the loss of lives  the destruction of property and the setback to the national economy that disasters are capable of inflicting.  It is therefore imperative that adequate resources be available and that they may  indeed  be accessed with ease through different direct modalities in order to assist countries in meeting their mitigation and adaptation programmes. The Copenhagen Green Climate Fund is now in the design phase. The representatives of Governments and experts involved would do well to pay attention to the existing climate change funding architecture so that the shortcomings of other funding mechanisms are not repeated.  Without the necessary financial resources and technical support  Samoa’s ability to adapt to and mitigate climate change will be severely curtailed. Thankfully  Samoa continues to benefit under the fast start finance window  both bilaterally and through regional projects made available by the generous support of our traditional and new development partners  such as Australia  China  the European Union  Japan  New Zealand  Italy  the Asian Development Bank  the Global Environment Facility  the World Bank and the United Nations  to name but a few. We are  indeed  very  very grateful.  Countries in different parts of the world look to the United Nations and its stronger members for peacekeeping arrangements to give those communities in strife time to re-establish and to find lasting solutions. Samoa continues to lend its unwavering support to that aspect of the United Nations mandate. I reaffirm that support  which is underpinned by my    11-51372 8  country’s contribution and the involvement of our police officers in the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Sudan  Liberia and Timor-Leste. Additionally  Samoa continues to be an integral part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific Forum.  Samoa warmly welcomes the admission of South Sudan as the United Nation’s newest member in July this year.  Samoa joins the international community’s support for the courage of the people of Tunisia  Egypt  Libya and now Syria in seeking relief from oppression and in gaining the freedoms and human rights to which they are rightly entitled.  At this rostrum a year ago  I did not expect the Arab spring  and spoke in earnest of the hope that progress would come in the then historic process to bring permanent peace to the peoples of Israel and Palestine (see A/65/PV.19). It is our long-held conviction that an independent Palestinian nation  taking its rightful place in our global family and living side by side with a secure Israel  is the only road to permanent peace. However  while we all know that that is the sensible outcome that must be achieved  it will sadly remain elusive without a clear sense of commitment and willingness by both sides to negotiate in good faith.  For genuine and permanent peace between Palestine and the State of Israel  there must be direct negotiations between the two countries. Addressing the symptoms  but not the root causes of the conflict is short-sighted and the result unsustainable. Solutions must be decided by the two parties  not imposed from outside. Without that strong buy-in from the Israelis and Palestinians themselves  any solutions will  at best  be short-lived. More than ever  visionary leadership  on both sides  that sees beyond the immediate dictates of short-sighted interests and that is  instead  willing to seize the opportunity to fashion a just and durable peace settlement  is critically needed at this point.  Terrorism  in its various forms and manifestations  is responsible for the horror and fear that have continued to grip the world’s attention. No country is immune from the reaches of terrorism  and we are all affected to varying degrees. Terrorist acts committed under whatever pretext or purpose can never be justified as morally acceptable. Equally  countering terrorism does not confer immunity from the rule of law  nor the abandonment of the principles of a civilized society.  No country can win the war against terrorism on its own. Only by pooling our resources and working collaboratively with each other can we stand a chance of defeating that senseless menace. Samoa  despite the heavy cost  is doing its best to meet our obligations in that collective effort.  Modest progress has been achieved in the efforts to reform the Security Council. Samoa remains convinced that an expanded Security Council that mirrors present-day realities is essential for multilateralism and for the Council’s integrity and credibility. Increases in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories should be part and parcel of the reform package."
"189",7527,"YEM",66,2011,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate our brother Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that  given his renowned experience and wisdom  he will ably execute the functions of his position. I wish him every success in his work. I would like to express our thanks and appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his constructive efforts in presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.   13 11-51670   Our thanks also go to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his deserved re-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations. We wish to express our thanks and appreciation to him  as well as to the entire Secretariat staff for their work over the past year  in particular for their follow-up of the situation in my country.  We wish to congratulate the people of the Republic of South Sudan on that country’s establishment and accession to the United Nations. We also wish to congratulate the National Transitional Council of Libya for its presence among us and for its representation of the brotherly Libyan people.  Since January  my country has been experiencing an acute political crisis. The political opposition that has been one of the main components of our system since the unified State of Yemen was established in May 1990 decided to relinquish all common denominators and rejected the principle of consensus  refusing to implement the agreement reached since 2006 following its defeat in the presidential elections. It has created crises  raising its demands and rejecting all compromises and solutions. Realizing that democratic means would not enable it to seize power  the opposition resorted to political manoeuvres  including violence  threatening the outbreak of civil war and complete devastation in Yemen. That could undermine all the achievements of the Yemeni people in the modern era  as well as their struggle to establish a democratic political system and to protect their national identity  social fabric  unique human harmony and the system that we have managed to build.  At the beginning of the 1990s  Yemen’s national movement made great progress by establishing a unified State of Yemen  founded on pluralistic democratic principles and coupled with various civil institutions that promoted and respected human rights. However  those who wished narrow  individual and partisan interests to prevail did not support that historic achievement. Therefore  they tried to stir up trouble  using the conflicts and mistakes made in Yemen in the early days of our unified State  as well as the challenges to development — the uncontrolled population growth  the prevailing poverty  the lack of national resources  increasing drought and desertification  and the scarce water and oil resources  which were the main source of income.   All those factors have made it impossible for thousands of university graduates to find employment  which has led to social and political tensions and frustration. But all the opposition forces used the tidal wave of change witnessed by Arab countries to prevent Yemen from achieving democratic change through elections. However  we respected young people’s demand for change and started a dialogue with them in order to meet their demands for reform. We have created tens of thousands of jobs in order to alleviate unemployment.   However  the opposition parties abused and misused the protests of our young people in order to seize power  and some of their elements have carried out subversive acts to sabotage the youth movement and its just demands. The opposition parties rejected the results of the democratic elections that were conducted under the international monitoring of the European Union  the Democratic National Institute and several international organizations  which verified that the elections were fair  democratic and transparent.  Our Government showed its readiness to meet the requests of our young people and their legitimate demands to build a better future for us and for prosperity — a future that is hindered by my country’s weak economy  limited national resources and the prevalence of poverty and unemployment  as well as by terrorism and the repercussions of the global financial crisis. Our Government kept on calling on our development partners and friends and international organizations to provide financial and economic support in order to achieve sustainable development in Yemen  which would ensure security and stability in our country.  The main reason for  and primary cause of  the current upheaval in Yemen is the dissatisfaction of the opposition and its refusal to endorse the election that took place in 2006. In that election our people showed confidence in the President of the Republic and chose him as our President. The opposition’s rejection of that process has led to the crisis that we are witnessing today at the economic  development  security and political levels.   Despite the intransigence of the opposition  the President of the Republic offered compromise in order to achieve reconciliation between the opposition and the Government. That has led to the postponement of parliamentary elections for two years. However  the efforts of our President continue through his initiatives before Parliament and the Consultative Council     11-51670 14  whereby he affirmed that he had no intention of running in the presidential elections and that he accepted the amendments to the Constitution and the electoral law  as well as an entire package of political reforms.  Our country has incurred heavy losses  estimated at more than $2 billion  as a result of the chaos caused by the opposition parties  which have tried to cut off roads  blow up oil pipelines and cut power lines in many of our cities  in particular in the capital  Ta’izz  Aden and Abyan. However  the Government continued to seek a peaceful solution to the political crisis  calling on the opposition to come to the table and begin dialogue. We in Yemen are confident that the recent division will be overcome by returning to constitutional legality and remedying certain shortcomings.  The Government offered a new opportunity for dialogue by endorsing the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as the foundation for a solution to the political crisis  especially given that His Excellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh decided to entrust his Vice-President with all constitutional powers  to initiate dialogue with the signatories of the Gulf initiative and to create a mechanism that would guarantee a smooth and democratic transfer of power. That would allow for reconciliation  reform  change and reconstruction in Yemen without any violation of security  the Constitution or democratic principles.  We believe that Yemen  as a country that opted for dialogue as a means of overcoming the political crisis  will provide a model for change in which all parties are winners and the status of women is enhanced. The President  following his return to Sana’a  declared in no uncertain terms that he supported the GCC initiative and was committed to it. He called on all parties to initiate dialogue and to reach a compromise with a view to its implementation.  My country is continuing to make every effort to fight Al-Qaida and its terrorist acts in our country despite our Government’s limited resources. We have dealt some serious blows to Al-Qaida in Abyan province in recent weeks. What we need at the international level is an integrated global strategy that would help us build our national capacities and thereby enable us to fight extremism and terrorist ideology. Such a strategy would not involve military force only but would be of a social  educational and political nature and would strive to eradicate poverty and achieve universal justice.  The Republic of Yemen attaches primary importance to human rights  which is one of the main pillars of the United Nations. Since the return of unity to Yemen in 1990  my country has made great strides in this area. We have established a Ministry for Human Rights and have become a signatory and party to a number of international human rights instruments and conventions  on whose implementation we submit periodic reports. We have also submitted our national reports within the context of the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council  with which we cooperate.  In that connection  we welcome the outcome of the review conducted by the Human Rights Council in Geneva and New York  in which we participated actively. There is no doubt that during the political crisis many human rights violations have been committed by all parties. The Government nonetheless showed a readiness to conduct independent national investigations and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Government also opened its doors to the fact-finding mission sent by the Human Rights Council. In response to an invitation by our Government  the mission visited Yemen in July and submitted its report to the Council on 19 September. However  my country believes that resolving the political crisis is the key to stopping all violations of human rights.  The Government of Yemen  during its chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China in 2010  continued to actively and sincerely work to achieve consensus and unity within the Group  which led to a consensus on many issues of interest to the Group  including  inter alia  climate change  the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals  and United Nations reform. In that connection  we wish every success to the Republic of Argentina during its chairmanship of the Group. We also wish every success to the fraternal Republic of Algeria  which will chair the Group in 2012.  The Israeli-Arab conflict represents the main threat to international peace and security. An objective understanding of the conflict clearly shows Israel’s intransigence and its Government’s policy of establishing settlements  its rejection of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  its   15 11-51670  refusal to abide by international legality  and its rejection of the Arab Peace Initiative. We call upon the international community and the peace sponsors  including the United States of America  to continue their efforts to achieve universal recognition of a sovereign State of Palestine and to allow it to join the United Nations as a fully fledged Member of the Organization and other world organizations and organs.  Allow me in closing to reiterate my thanks to the Secretary-General for his efforts in following the crisis in Yemen. I wish also to thank all the United Nations agencies for their humanitarian efforts in my country during this political crisis."
"190",7565,"YUG",66,2011,"The rapid changes in our political and economic environment show  once again  the necessity of this annual gathering of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We have a difficult task ahead of us. I wish the President of the General Assembly every success. He can rest assured that he has our fullest support. I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. His steady hand has helped to steer the United Nations through challenging times. To him  too  we offer all our support.  It has been a year of momentous change. An economic crisis pervades most liberal economies. A wave of political change is sweeping through much of the Middle East. Climatic turbulence leaves loss and tragedy in its wake. Famine stalks the Horn of Africa. New choices confront political leaders. New priorities are presented to citizens. The worst that we could do now is to allow fear and indecision to govern us.  These are also times that call for a deep commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism. Every crisis that we address reaches beyond our national frontiers. There is no way that we can resolve such matters without the framework of the international laws and rules to which we are all bound.  The financial crisis has had a profound and negative effect on all our aspirations. While each country must adjust its expectations  we cannot allow ourselves to be guided only by our national concerns. In fact  they are best supported by greater commitment to a deeper solidarity among nations and far more intense cooperation. The great economic and political unions have achieved success by balancing sacrifice with gain for all. The same challenge now confronts the European Union (EU).  In North Africa and the Middle East  we have seen a wave of protest that has convulsed the region. The Republic of Serbia and the Serbian people have had a long relationship with all the peoples of that region. We stand by them. We know what is involved in such changes.  In a time of such uncertainty  crises call for United Nations-sanctioned involvement to save lives and to keep the peace. There will be more such missions. I am very pleased that the Republic of Serbia is now actively engaged in several such missions  and we will continue our commitment. In that spirit  the Republic of Serbia is a signatory to the evolving climate change commitments and conventions. We also enthusiastically support the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  In times as complex as these  our objective must be to manage real crises well and to avoid creating unnecessary ones. There are problems that can be resolved through patient discussion and the building of trust. Unilateral action in such circumstances simply creates crisis for no good reason.  That is why  in our regional issues of South Eastern Europe  we always promote the principles and the presence of the United Nations. As a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  we were able to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding in Belgrade. Such networks create layers of communication and trust at a time of globalization.  Our bid to join the European Union is the platform on which we intend to build and contribute to our shared objectives. Regional cooperation is a cornerstone of our diplomacy  and we believe that it is only to the benefit of the entire region. That is reflected in our chairmanships of the Central European Initiative and the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative. Most important  it is also reflected in Serbia’s chairmanship of the South-East European Cooperation Process  our region’s most important initiative. Next year  my country will follow   7 11-51191  that up by taking over responsibilities to lead the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization.  Serbia has established an entirely new level of confidence in relations with Croatia. That has been of strategic significance in securing stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We welcome Croatia’s imminent accession to the European Union.  All of that has set the stage for Serbia to actively consider seeking the chairmanship-in-office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for the year 2014 - the centenary of the start of the First World War. The unifying symbolism of 2014 would not only help catalyse efforts to resolve the unfinished business on the old continent’s shared agenda. It would also help to close the book on an era that did not witness the enduring stability that the nations of the OSCE space deserve.  We have devoted extraordinary levels of resources to capture war criminals. Finally  the Republic of Serbia has completed its obligations to itself and to the international community. We believe that  after the tragedies of the 1990s  that exercise is a very necessary catharsis for our nation. That action was also taken to demonstrate that Serbia wishes to move to a climate of total reconciliation throughout the region. We feel that we have done our part.  Equally  we insist that everyone else does their part as well. As in all previous instances involving war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Balkans  the Security Council has given a mandate to investigate. That has greatly contributed to the process of regional reconciliation. This is the standard that must be applied in uncovering the full truth about allegations made in a deeply disturbing report by the Council of Europe  entitled “Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo”. Only the Security Council can make sure a comprehensive investigation takes place. Only it can give a universal mandate and jurisdiction to ensure that all perpetrators of war crimes in the Balkans are brought to justice  including those responsible for trafficking in human organs in Kosovo. I strongly believe that ending the culture of impunity in some parts of the Balkans is a common goal shared by every member of the international community.  There is a certain irony to our proceedings today. This year we have welcomed a new member to the United Nations family  the Republic of South Sudan. The Republic of Serbia welcomes its membership in the United Nations. We welcome them because they and the Republic of the Sudan  after many years of conflict  arrived at a settlement that was achieved as a result of long  difficult negotiations between the two parties.   The fundamental principle that the best settlements occur when two parties agree  each making compromises  surely is universal. I subscribe enthusiastically to the comments by the President of the United States  made from this rostrum  on that very subject of negotiations. I agree that there is no shortcut to ending a conflict that has endured for a long time  and that peace depends on compromise among people  who must live together long after our speeches are over.  However  this rule is not being applied to Serbia on the matter of its province of Kosovo and Metohija. On 17 February 2008  Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian authorities attempted unilateral secession  a violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter  the Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). A majority of Member States have refrained from recognizing Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. They have continued to abide by their United Nations Charter obligations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia  allow me to once again sincerely thank those countries for their support and solidarity.   Earlier this week  we heard from this rostrum a dangerous appeal for countries to recognize Kosovo. That appeal does not contribute to regional stability. Rather  it lessens our chances of finding a solution we can all accept. The appeal we heard is not an appeal for peace but an appeal to endorse unilateralism and would create a deeply disturbing precedent  namely  encouragement for secessionists everywhere.  In July  talks between Belgrade and Pristina  facilitated by the European Union  were briefly suspended by the facilitator. At that time  there was an attempt to impose customs officers on the administrative boundary line between Serbia proper and North Kosovo. Violence erupted. My Government did all it could to prevent violence from spreading  but was this necessary? The effect was to remind Serbs that they are negotiating with a gun to their heads and with the constant threat of international isolation. It reminds    11-51191 8  Serbs that the excuse of violence by others is a tool used irresponsibly to threaten Serbs. It reminds Serbs of the anti-Serb pogroms in Kosovo in March of 2004. It reminds Serbs of the failed negotiations and the imposition of a unilaterally declared independence.  I want to remind the Assembly and all Members of the United Nations that on 5 October 2000 the Republic of Serbia voluntarily and peacefully overthrew its past and entered a new phase in its history  in which it placed the fate of the Serbian nation under the protection of democracy  civility  peace and dialogue.  For this reason  we take grave offence at this climate of threat emanating from countries that we would otherwise consider our most natural partners. In the case of Serbia  the dialogue between two parties was initiated in March 2011  following a delay of several months to accommodate the electoral schedule in Pristina.  We have made very significant progress during those negotiations. The Republic of Serbia  I assure the Assembly  will remain a very active party to this dialogue. There are numerous issues that must be addressed in the months ahead. I appeal to all involved to remain engaged in this process in a constructive spirit. To that end  we expect the International Security Force in Kosovo and the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo to fully observe the United Nations doctrine of status neutrality  in accordance with their mandates under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the source of their universal legitimacy  both on the ground and in the international arena.  Progress needs trust. Negotiations and reconciliation are not achieved through concessions from one side only. Success does not occur when threats of violence are issued and coercive action takes place in the course of negotiations. Our response to this is to say that  just as we will never accept unilateral action  we will also not abandon the negotiation process.  This is why we have stated that we cannot and will not recognize the unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo. It is also why we believe that we must settle all other issues with Pristina  because our region needs to have a stable environment.  The Republic of Serbia has always sought tangible assurances  bound by international agreement and guarantees  that Serbian communities inhabiting Kosovo  Serbian interests and Serbia’s cultural heritage will be protected and allowed to flourish.  Many of these issues have been discussed over the past few years in different formats. Occasionally  there have been agreements reached  but never implemented. It is time that matters were clarified. Any form of understanding on the matter of Kosovo has as a conditio sine qua non the explicit negotiated and guaranteed agreement on the following matters essential to the protection of Serbs in Kosovo.  The first concerns the status of the Serbian population in North Kosovo. All acknowledge that this is an issue that must be addressed on the basis of the current realities. Attempts to change the current realities would not be conducive to constructive solutions.  The second issue involves the proper implementation of decentralization in Kosovo. All those enclaves that are isolated from other Serbs must have a political  judicial and economic life providing the standards that allow them to prosper where they are. Serbia remains ready to continue to provide the necessary support to these threatened populations.  The third issue is that of the status of the Serbian Orthodox Church and of some of its key holy sites. The protection of those sites and the special status that must be given to them to preserve their unique identity and their livelihoods is a matter of fundamental concern. It comes as a matter of surprise to me that an offer that would be acceptable to the Republic of Serbia and the Serbian Orthodox Church has not been volunteered by the other side. That issue is one of the most basic  and its denial should be considered a total embarrassment to the authorities in Pristina and the supervisory institutions and nations present in Kosovo.  Finally  the question of property must be resolved. Thousands of private claims remain pending  making hostages of those internally displaced in 1999. Commercial property claims are unresolved  as well.  The failure to advance with goodwill on the very issue that is at the core of our concerns — the rights of the Serbian communities in Kosovo — is very disturbing. For us  those four issues are the litmus test.  There is so much to say about the progress in my country that is positive that it always saddens me that I must repeat my concerns about the way in which the   9 11-51191  issue of Kosovo is being handled. Let us all recall that Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under the interim administration of the United Nations  pending a comprehensive settlement endorsed by the Security Council. There is a limit to what and for how long Serbia must be held accountable for developments where it is asked to assume responsibility  but without the necessary authority.   I look forward to the day when I can stand at this rostrum and report that we have resolved that issue and that we have found a mutually acceptable compromise  not an imposed outcome where one side gets everything that it has ever wanted and the other side gets nothing. A maximalist zero-sum approach is a solution with no future. We are ready. We are committed. It is for others to provide grounds for optimism.  The Republic of Serbia has two immediate parallel objectives: to secure a mutually acceptable arrangement in Kosovo that provides iron-clad guarantees for the Serbian communities and to accelerate our progress to membership of the European Union. Both those objectives are achievable. It would be foolish for anyone to think that one objective will be sacrificed on the altar of the other. It is for others to decide whether they think that the achievement of those two objectives is for the good of the region and for stability. We are convinced that it is in everyone’s interest.  I believe that Serbia has met the criteria to be invited to be a candidate for membership of the European Union. I also believe that my country is ready to start accession negotiations. I believe that if that were to occur  Serbia would  for the first time in 20 years  begin to believe that the EU actually sees Serbia as an integral part of a complete European Union.  I fervently believe that my country has set an example in the region in matters related to reconciliation  the establishment of the rule of law and the fight against organized crime  as well as in building the administrative capacity to handle European norms.  Our battle against organized crime is a global one. We know that international organized crime wants to use the region of South-East Europe as a base to penetrate the EU. The Republic of Serbia has decided that it is a strategic priority and a national security priority that Serbia will help prevent that. Serbia is therefore fighting a battle to protect citizens of the European Union. It is actively engaged in a wider strategy to destroy the links between organized crime and international terrorism. We cooperate with all nations that share those objectives. We appeal to the entire region to join us in that battle.   I am therefore convinced that the presence of Serbia as a candidate  actively negotiating its accession  is an important asset for the European Union.   In that way  Serbia can continue to be an even more effective member of the United Nations  contributing fully and enthusiastically to the issues that touch common humanity."
"191",7593,"ZAF",66,2011,"On behalf of the Government and the people of South Africa  I wish to extend our sincere congratulations to Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the General Assembly. We wish him a successful tenure in the stewardship of this body and assure him of our delegation’s full support. We also congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for the diligent manner in which he guided the work of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  I would further like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment as Secretary-General.  It is also an honour for South Africa to welcome the Republic of South Sudan to the community of nations as the 193rd State Member of the United Nations.  This month  the United States and the world marked the tenth anniversary of the horrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  which affected the United States and 89 other countries. That horrific incident united the international community and strengthened its resolve to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. We pay our respects to the victims of the tragedy and their families. We reaffirm our commitment to working with other Member States to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  The theme of this session — “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” — is timely and well chosen. The Charter of the United Nations mandates the Organization to utilize mediation as one of the tools to prevent and resolve conflicts across the globe. The role of mediation as a tool for the settlement of disputes has renewed relevance today  given the number of conflicts in the world. We should defend the independence and impartiality of the United Nations and promote the principles of its Charter during conflicts and crises. The United Nations should never take sides in any conflict but should always maintain its impartiality. The United Nations must not allow itself to be used by any country  regardless of its history or size. All citizens of the world should feel confident and secure in the knowledge that the United Nations is above all partisan interests and serves only those of the citizens of the globe.  We are of the view that regional organizations play a crucial role in the resolution of conflicts and in regional mediation processes. The Charter of the United Nations itself provides for the role of regional organizations in cooperation with the United Nations. This role of the regions must always be enforced and enhanced  and not undermined. In our continent  the African Union (AU) continues to play a significant role in mediation and the resolution of conflicts  trying at   23 11-50702  all times to produce African solutions to African problems  of course with the support of the world.  This year  the world witnessed the so-called Arab Spring in North Africa and the Middle East. With regard to the situation in Libya  the AU played a crucial role in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis  in line with its mandate of working for peace and stability in the continent. However  it is a matter of record now that the AU efforts were never given a chance. Military actions were preferred over peaceful means.  Nonetheless  the AU continues to be seized with the Libyan conflict  as it should be. South Africa  through the AU and the United Nations  will work with the National Transitional Council  the representative of the Libyan people  as it proceeds to form an inclusive transitional Government that will take the Libyan seat in the African Union. During this period of working towards normalcy in Libya  we call for a cessation of hostilities and an end to the NATO aerial bombardment. We also call for the lifting of the no-fly zone  whose imposition was necessary for the protection of civilians.  The proliferation of arms in Libya is a major concern. The transitional Government will need to be supported in addressing this security issue. It may pose a serious challenge affecting the entire subregion if it is not adequately attended to. We also urge the new Libyan authorities to ensure the protection of migrant workers  especially those from sub-Saharan African countries  who number approximately 2.5 million. Immediate measures should be taken to put an end to the killing  arbitrary arrest and detention of migrant workers and black Libyans.  We will fully support the people of Libya as they go through the transition towards a new  united and democratic Libya that protects human rights  human dignity and freedom.  South Africa continues to support international efforts to assist the people of Palestine and Israel to find lasting peace. The decades-old struggle of the Palestinian people for a sovereign State of their own has now reached a turning point. The Palestinian Authority  backed by the League of Arab States  has stated its intention to seek United Nations membership for the State of Palestine. South Africa fully supports this position. It is a decisive step towards achieving lasting peace  economic cooperation and prosperity for the millions of people in the Middle East  and we urge that it be viewed favourably.  We also support the ongoing struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We urge the international community to support their quest for freedom  human rights and dignity.  We reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo against the people of Cuba in order to help them gain their economic freedom.  All Member States have a duty to safeguard the future and relevance of the United Nations. Recent international developments have made more urgent our efforts to intensify the reform agenda of the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  as well as the Bretton Woods institutions. No reform can be complete without the substantive reform of the Security Council  whose membership must be consistent with the principle of equitable geographical representation. In this regard  we reiterate our call for Africa to be represented in the category of permanent membership of the Security Council.  South Africa is preparing to welcome the international community and all stakeholders to the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to the seventh Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  in November and December this year. The success of the Conference is highly dependent on the willingness of all parties to reach an agreement. It does not depend on South Africa alone. As leaders  we are accountable to the global citizenry  the ordinary people that suffer daily from the impacts of climate change. They hold high expectations of their leaders to be responsible and to find effective solutions to the threat that climate change poses to their livelihood  quality of life  dignity and  in many cases  their very survival. We dare not fail them.  We are witnessing the catastrophic effects of famine in Somalia and neighbouring countries. Our response should not be left to the United Nations alone; it requires united action from all of us. South Africa has been humbled to contribute in a small way to the alleviation of human suffering. The people of Somalia still need more support  and we urge the world to focus its attention more sharply on Somalia and its neighbours in the Horn of Africa.    11-50702 24   It is commendable that the Millennium Development Goals and their realization by 2015 continue to feature on the agenda of the General Assembly. We now have four years to go before we reach the target date. It is clear that many of the Goals will not be attained on time  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We call on the international community and the United Nations to redouble efforts to assist countries that are lagging.  At this session  we will be commemorating the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action — the outcome document of the World Conference against Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  which was held in Durban in 2001. Racism and racial discrimination continue to pose a challenge to humankind and to negate the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We should continue to work together to eradicate the scourge of racism.  On 8 January 2012  the African National Congress (ANC)  the oldest liberation movement in Africa  will mark 100 years of existence since its establishment in 1912. The ANC spearheaded the struggle against racial oppression  colonialism and apartheid in South Africa. It inspired many in the African continent to fight for their freedom and independence from colonialism.  The United Nations declared apartheid a crime against humanity and in that way endorsed the struggle against racial oppression in our country. The centenary of the ANC recognizes the immense contribution of the United Nations and the international community in working to eradicate racism and racial discrimination in the world. We will  tomorrow  host a symposium on South Africa’s contribution to the fight against racism and racial discrimination.  Working together  let us remain committed to multilateralism and cooperation in this session of the General Assembly and beyond  and promote the realization of a more equitable and just world."
"192",7635,"ZMB",66,2011,"I wish  first of all  instance to extend my sincere congratulations to the President on his election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In a similar vein  I thank His Excellency Joseph Deiss for his leadership of the sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General.  I would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm and hearty welcome to the community of nations to the Republic of South Sudan following its independence on 9 July. We commend both the Governments of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan for the smooth transition during the handover and takeover of power. Zambia encourages the two countries to resolve the outstanding issues between them amicably and to work towards maintaining peaceful relations  as that is the only way to achieve economic and social development.  The theme for the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”  is indeed a pertinent one  considering the various conflicts across the globe that threaten international peace and security. The recent upheavals in North Africa and the Middle East not only present a new dimension to politics in that region but also highlight the need for mediation to avert the outbreak of fighting.  My delegation wishes to underscore the need for the international community to resolve conflicts on the African continent  including the situation in Libya  within the frameworks established by the African Union. We believe that local solutions have a higher prospect of being respected and accepted by all parties to the conflict.  In this regard  Zambia aligns itself with the mediation efforts put in place by the African Union and supports the Roadmap for the Resolution of the Crisis in Libya endorsed by the African Union heads of State and Government at their seventeenth Summit held in    11-51681 22  Malabo  Equatorial Guinea  this year. With regard to Libya  Zambia shares the relief of the Libyan people in ridding themselves of a leader who committed egregious atrocities against his people.   We must  however  express serious concern about new atrocities being committed against black people in that country — both citizens and migrants from African countries. We call on this body to send a strong message that it will not only pursue perpetrators of such atrocities as vigorously as it did Al-Qadhafi but also undertake to investigate all allegations thoroughly. It would be tragic if  in the euphoria of celebrating the ousting of Al-Qadhafi  the United Nations turned a blind eye to atrocities still being committed.  The Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to be a major concern to international peace and security. We understand the frustrations of the Palestinian people over the long negotiations  which have completely stalled in recent years. In that regard  I wish to reaffirm that Zambia recognizes the Palestinian State  with pre-1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital. In a similar vein  Zambia recognizes the State of Israel and its right to live in peace with its Palestinian neighbour.  The drought situation in the Horn of Africa presents a humanitarian emergency that threatens the lives of 12 million people. While erratic rainfall in past years is the main cause of the drought  the prevalent political instability and violence in Somalia has hampered that country’s ability to effectively respond to the crisis. Zambia has pledged to donate several metric tons of various food items and cash from the Government and the private sector.   The need to address the political instability and violence in Somalia continues to be urgent. We therefore call upon the United Nations to implement the recommendations of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia  in which he called for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission there.  Exactly one week ago  on 20 September  general elections took place in my country. On Friday  three days later  the fifth and newest President of the country  Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata  was inaugurated. The incumbent President graciously conceded and handed over power. It was smooth and peaceful. It was a triumph for democracy in my country. Zambia strongly believes in the rule of law and is concerned at trends towards unconstitutional changes of Government — trends that in some cases receive the active support of powerful countries in the international community.  The political stability that Zambia has and continues to enjoy has had a positive impact on the economic development of the country. Over the past decade real gross domestic product growth has averaged 5.4 per cent. While that growth has reflected effective macroeconomic management and good copper prices  it has also been built on the foundation of Zambia’s stable political environment and improved record of governance. In 2011  we expect to consolidate that strong performance with growth now projected to be above 7 per cent  second only to the projected growth rates of 9.2 per cent for developing Asia and significantly above the projected 5.5 per cent growth rate for sub-Saharan Africa.  Those economic trends notwithstanding  Zambia still faces the challenge of translating its economic growth into a significant reduction in poverty and a general improvement in the living standards of its citizenry. It is our intention for the benefits of economic growth to be broadly shared by the population at large. We hope to achieve that by continuing to strengthen our governance institutions  maintaining peace and stability and ensuring that we remain open to the opportunities that global trade and the exchange of ideas and experiences offer to a developing economy.  The country’s economic development agenda is guided by the National Vision  under which Zambia aspires to be a prosperous middle-income country by 2030. The national agenda has been operationalized through five-year national development plans. Currently the country is operating under its Sixth National Development Plan  under the theme “Sustained economic growth and poverty reduction”. With these achievements  Zambia is on course to achieve five of the eight targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2011.  In four years the MDG target date will be upon us. While Zambia has made notable progress towards achieving the 2015 MDG targets  particularly in terms of increased access to education  reduced maternal  infant and under-5 mortality rates and child nutrition  those achievements risk being reversed  pushing the country off track  owing to the multifaceted negative impacts of the world economic recession  unfulfilled   23 11-51681  commitments and ever diminishing levels of financial assistance from cooperation partners. Under the circumstances  many developing countries are unlikely to meet the MDG targets. It is therefore important not only that every effort should be made to assist countries stay on track but that we start planning for a post-2015 MDG framework.  Beyond the challenges posed by infectious diseases  Zambia is also affected by the emerging global trend of non-communicable diseases. The socio-demographic and technological transition that goes with urbanization and industrialization has resulted in an increase in non-communicable diseases in our country. I would therefore like to commend President Al-Nasser for hosting the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. My delegation is  nevertheless  cautious that while focusing on non-communicable diseases  resources meant for infectious diseases  such as HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  should be secured  so that the gains already achieved in these areas are not lost.  Allow me to express Zambia’s gratitude to the Secretary-General for organizing the High-level Meeting on addressing desertification  land degradation and drought in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication on 20 September 2011. There is no doubt that the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is the least supported of the three Rio Conventions  the others being the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. It is in that light that the convening of the High-level Meeting  as a means of raising awareness about desertification  land degradation and drought at a high level  is most welcome. There is clearly a need for concerted efforts on the part of all Member States to raise the profile of the Desertification Convention to the level of the other two.  Zambia views desertification and land degradation as a major economic  social and environmental problem that requires immediate attention. It is in that regard that my country’s sixth national development plan  for 2011 to 2015  has endeavoured to mainstream environmental management in general and sustainable land management in particular. The challenge now is for Zambia to mobilize adequate and predictable financial resources to implement the programmes contained in the plan. The mobilization of resources for implementing programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought is an obligation shared by all Member States  including those unaffected by desertification  as is spelled out in the Convention  in Agenda 21 and in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  among others.   We therefore call for the judicious implementation of the outcome decisions of the recently held High-level Meeting on desertification and land degradation. We also call on all States to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for programmes aimed at combating desertification and mitigating the effects of drought.  Turning to the topical subject of climate change  whose adverse effects are responsible for exacerbating desertification  land degradation and drought  the need to put in place a new and dynamic international regime for climate change has never been so urgent. The adverse effects of climate change are being borne disproportionately by poor countries such as my own. The effects of climate change are real and are already affecting our agriculture  water  and infrastructure  to mention only some sectors. Yet  as we have repeatedly said  it is rich countries that are responsible for the historic build-up of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere  the problem that has brought about global warming and climate change. The developed world should therefore show leadership when it comes to agreeing on a new international regime on climate change.  Zambia looks forward to the forthcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Durban  South Africa  in December. We are confident that these talks will build on the positive outcome of the last Conference  held in Cancún  last December. Africa  which is hosting such talks for the first time  is determined to ensure a successful outcome. Time is running out and we can no longer afford the luxury of inconclusive talks each year. We call on all parties to commit to making progress and ensuring that agreement is reached on all outstanding issues so as to pave the way for a new climate change regime. We also call for the immediate operationalization of all funds established so far under the Climate Change Convention  thereby making financial resources accessible to countries in need.    11-51681 24   The High-level Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was a timely reminder to all nations to continue to promote the rights of all people regardless of race or creed as equal citizens of the world. Zambia recommits itself to the just cause of fighting against any form of racism or racial discrimination  xenophobia and related intolerance.  With the year 2012 very much in sight  Zambia hopes for a successful conclusion to negotiations on the arms trade treaty. A strong and robust treaty will help foster regional and international peace and security. Zambia also supports an arms trade treaty that encompasses all conventional weapons  including small arms and light weapons and their ammunition; components of weapons; dual-use equipment with a military end-use; and arms production equipment and technology. Furthermore  Zambia advocates an arms trade treaty with a broad scope that includes landmines and conventional weapons already covered by international weapon-specific agreements  as well as technical support.  Last Friday the President of Sierra Leone  in his capacity as Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State on Security Council reform  reminded the Assembly of the need to hasten negotiations on this important issue. Zambia aligns itself with that statement and sentiment. It is a fact that Africa is now one of the largest regions represented in the United Nations  with 54 members  the same number as Asia. It is also a fact that three-quarters of the issues on the Security Council’s agenda are African issues.   Unfortunately  it is also a fact that Africa is the only continent with no representation in the permanent-membership category of the Council. In addition  Africa is underrepresented in the non-permanent-member category. Africa’s request for two permanent seats  with all the rights and obligations of current members  and for two additional non-permanent seats  is a matter of justice and the right to have an equal say in the decision-making on issues that concern our continent. It is also a matter of democracy. Above all  it is about the dignity of a people and the dignity of a continent."
"193",7671,"ZWE",66,2011,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that under his able leadership the General Assembly will successfully address the pressing issues on the agenda of the current session. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Deiss  for having successfully steered the proceedings of this House during the sixty-fifth session.  I wish also to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his reappointment for a second term. We remain hopeful that the Secretary-General will strive to shepherd the United Nations with an open  transparent and inclusive multilateral approach. Such an approach  I believe  would renew and revive the hopes and expectations of developing countries in the efficacy of this world body. Zimbabwe places its hopes in a United Nations that recognizes the equality of sovereign States as enshrined in the founding Charter.  I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to the Republic of South Sudan on its attainment of independence and its subsequent admission as the 193rd Member of the United Nations family. As we all congratulate this new nation  Zimbabwe calls upon the international community to render all the necessary support to its Government and its people in tackling the numerous development challenges that lie ahead of them. Zimbabwe stands ready to make its modest contribution to that end.  The theme “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” is most apt. But how do we  the United Nations Members  measure up in relation to it in our activities here at the United Nations and out there  in the real world? It is my principled view that we must be duty-and honour-bound to operationalize the principles upon which the Charter of the United Nations is based. We must not be guilty of manipulating the Charter to serve our particular or sectional designs and ambitions. The Charter is our set of commandments that must be strictly obeyed by each and every Member if international and regional peace is to be maintained.   We cannot honestly say today that this is the position with regard to NATO States versus Libya. Whatever political disturbances might have first occurred in Benghazi  the process of mediation and peaceful negotiations was never given full play. It was deliberately and blatantly excluded from positively influencing developments. There was quick resort to invoking Chapter VII of the Charter  with a gross  deliberate misinterpretation of the scope of the mandate originally given NATO to oversee and protect civilians.  Bilateral hatreds and quarrels or ulterior motives must not be allowed to creep into the consideration of matters pertaining to threats to international peace and security  or even to the principle of the responsibility to protect.  We have yet to be convinced that the involvement of the mighty Powers in Libya’s affairs has not hindered the advent of the process of peace  democracy and prosperity in that sister African country. Our African Union would never have presumed to impose a    11-50871 18  leadership on the fraternal people of Libya  as NATO countries have illegally sought to do  and  in fact  have done. At the very least  the African Union would have wished to join those principled members of this body who preferred an immediate ceasefire and peaceful dialogue in Libya. The African Union was and remains fully seized of this crisis and will spare no effort in working to fully complement the United Nations so that peace may return to Libya and its tormented people. We wish that process Godspeed.  The newly minted principle of the responsibility to protect should not be twisted to provide cover for its premeditated abuse in violating the sacred international principle enshrined in the Charter of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States  because to do so amounts to an act of aggression and causes the destabilization of a sovereign State. Moreover  to selectively and arbitrarily apply that principle serves merely to undermine its general acceptability. Indeed  more than other States  all five permanent members of the Security Council bear a huge responsibility in this regard for ensuring that their historical privilege is used more to protect the United Nations Charter than to breach it  as is happening currently in Libya through the blatantly illegal  brutal  callous and murderous NATO bombings. There we see NATO bombing places  seeking out  hunting and hounding the children of Al-Qadhafi. Have the alleged sins of the father now been visited on the sons? Have the children lost their right to life? They are no longer human beings; they are being hunted every day. Or is it because each of them is no longer worth the price of a barrel of oil?  After more than 20 000 NATO bombing sorties that targeted Libyan towns  including Tripoli  there is now an unbelievable and most disgraceful scramble by some NATO countries for Libyan oil  indicating thereby that the real motive for their aggression against Libya was to control and own its abundant fuel resources. What a shame.   Yesterday  it was Iraq  and Bush and Blair were the liars and aggressors as they made unfounded allegations of possession of weapons of mass destruction. This time  it is the NATO countries that are the liars and aggressors  as they make similarly unfounded allegations of destruction of civilian lives by Al-Qadhafi.  When we in Zimbabwe sought to redress the ills of colonialism and racism by fully acquiring our natural resources  mainly our land and minerals  we were and still are subjected to unparalleled vilification and pernicious economic sanctions  the reasons — lies again — alleged to be violations of the rule of law  human rights and democracy  which never  never occurred. My people have condemned these illegal sanctions  and recently more than two million protesters’ signatures have demonstrated their antipathy for them. We thank the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the African Union for supporting us and demanding the immediate removal of the illegal sanctions.  We in Africa are also duly concerned about the activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC)  which seems to exist only for alleged offenders from the developing world  the majority of them Africans. A blind eye is routinely turned to leaders of the powerful Western States guilty of international crimes  such as Bush and Blair. Such selective justice has eroded the credibility of the ICC on the African continent.  My country continues to work with others for a revitalized General Assembly. However  our ambitions extend to the need to reform the Security Council as well. Africa’s call for at least two permanent seats on the Security Council for its members has been constant for decades. Africa cannot remain the only region without permanent membership in the Security Council.  The current global economic crisis and the attendant financial crisis compounds the plight of the most vulnerable  that is  the developing countries. The present international economic and financial architecture has to be reformed and made to respond timeously to the real needs of all our peoples. The situation challenges the ability of our developing world to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action against racism  xenophobia and other related social ills  let us all recommit ourselves to fighting and defeating these evils.  My country fully supports the right of the gallant people of Palestine to statehood and membership in the Organization. The United Nations must become credible by welcoming into its bosom all those whose right to attain sovereign independence and freedom from occupation and colonialism is legitimate. Let us all accept Palestine as a legitimate State and a Member   19 11-50871  of this body. Similarly  the tormented people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic must not be forgotten. We call for immediate progress in the engagements for a solution to their long-running saga.  The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held later this year  is a pivotal occasion from which we should emerge with agreed measures to address matters of climate change and how to mitigate threats to the very existence of small island States in particular  and to the coastal regions of many heavily populated nations. Zimbabwe will be fully engaged in those negotiations.  Let me reiterate my country’s full belief in the aspirations enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We must all resist any abuse to which it may be exposed through the unwelcome behaviour of a few. My country celebrates the UN-Women entity  as it addresses the position of more than half of humankind in all our countries.  The African Union must not be undermined; rather  it should be allowed to complement the efforts of the United Nations for peace and security on the continent. Zimbabwe is a peaceful member of the African Union  SADC  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  the Non-Aligned Movement and many other international economic and trade organizations  and thus desires to continue to play its part in creating a peaceful environment in the world. The United Nations can count on the unqualified support of Zimbabwe as required  even if only in our modest way.  I wish the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly every success."
