"1",2,"AFG",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Afghan delegation  I should like to extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that the present session will  under your able leadership  witness significant steps toward finding solutions to many of the problems confronting human society.2. We should also like to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  for his able handling of the presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My colleagues and I also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the energy and perception with which  since his election to the post of Secretary-General  he has embarked upon the manifoldduties and heavy responsibilities of this highly esteemed office. 3. In the changing world of today  with problems increasingboth in number and in dimension  human society in general-and the small countries in particular are placing special hope in the United Nations. We all see with regret that many parties to many of the problems facing the worldtoday try their best to avoid bringing to the machinery of this Organization  its organs and specialized agencies questions in which their vital interests are involved. If this process is allowed to go on unchecked in the direction inwhich it has been heading in recent years  it will inevitably lead to this result: either the United Nations will become a burdensome bureaucracy  or the world will be misled into a dangerous condition of self-deception  or both.4. In the not-too-distant past  the world discovered too late that this course of events could only lead us to catastrophic consequences. It is still early enough to re-examine our experience with the United Nations and tofind ways effectively to carry out the basic principles embodied in its Charter. It is on this basis that the delegation of Afghanistan wishes to emphasize the necessity for a genuine  deep and practical discussion of item 24 of the agenda.5.	In this  I address myself not only to the great Powers but also to the entire membership of this Organization. It is the responsibility of all of us to make the Charter  and this Organization  an effective instrument to create better political  economic and social conditions in the world in which we all live and must live together.6.	We shall present our view on that subject when the question comes before the General Assembly for debate  so we shall not go into detail about it here. However  I do want to say that  as a small nation  we should like to see the United Nations reflect the true conscience of the world whenever the idea of naked power  and of economic and political dominance  attempts to obscure the need for a balanced approach to international politics.7.	This Organization should not in any way be prohibited from serving as a free forum of the community of nations and as an instrument for arriving  by means of constructive dialogs  at just and viable solutions to the many problems facing the world. In this spirit  my delegation would like to voice its full appreciation of the remarks made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report to this Assembly on the work of the Organization [A18701J Add.l]. We hope that the detente of the great Powers will encompass the finding of means to strengthen the United Nations  rather than by-passing this Organization and taking the world back to the methods of the era before its birth.8.	In this context  it would be relevant to refer to one tragedy the shadow of which continues to hang over the conscience of all of us who have assembled here. From this rostrum we have spoken a number of times about the fate of the people of Viet-Nam. It is high time that the community of nations as a whole seriously addressed itself to this continuing threat to international peace and security. Afghanistan has always supported a solution of the question of Viet-Nam-and of all Indochina based on the decisive role of the will of the peoples of the area themselves in determining their own destiny without any foreign intervention. We shall continue to render our support to the struggling people of the Indochinese peninsula on the basis of these principles  which can be considered the sole criteria for the solution of their problems.9.	We shall have the opportunity of commenting on the individual items composing the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as they arise. Being conscious of the necessity to economize the very valuable time of this august Assembly  I shall only summarize very briefly at this time the views of the Afghan delegation  and of my Government  on some of the major developments of the period between the last session of the General Assembly and the present one.10.	The first of these developments is  fortunately  a positive one. The increasing recognition of and adherence to the philosophy of non-alignment  and its role in world politics  is a source of particular satisfaction to Afghanistan. In the past year alone  many events and even the attitudes of some of the great Powers have indicated this trend. The recent Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Georgetown  Guyana in August  has made a significant contribution to the further development of the concepts of peaceful coexistence and to the application of independent judgment to international events solely on the basis of their merit. The non-aligned countries of the world are looking forward to the summit meeting to be held next year in Algeria and are confident that it will make a positive contribution both to the noble cause of international peace and security and to the development of better relations among the different members of the world community.11.	The question of international peace and security naturally leads to that of world disarmament. We would like to join in the earnest appeal of all the peace-loving nations for a rapid and complete end to the dangerous race in armaments  If we do not achieve the goal of total disarmament for which our generation and the ones preceding us have so earnestly longed  the planet on which we live will be an inherently unsafe dwelling place not only for us and for our children but for their children as well.12.	With regard to the problem of terrorism  we would like to bring to the attention of this Assembly the following essential observations. To disturb the safety of innocent people anywhere in the world cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. However  in the light of this same basic norm of human conduct  no one should be allowed to deceive the world into believing that equally innocent people  deprived of their land and communal entity  shall have no right to fight for the recovery of their usurped homes. It is the urgent responsibility of this Organization and particularly of the major Powers of the world to use all the means at their disposal for finding and applying a solution to the problem of Palestine. Among all the matters of war and peace  none is more dangerous nor demands our attention more than the situation in the Middle East a situation created by the occupation of Arab territories by Israel and by its blunt refusal to withdraw its forces from those territories. With a shaky and precarious history of cease-fires  no progress has been made towards a satisfactory settlement in that troubled area.13.	Over 20 years of usurpation of the Palestinian people's rights and the continued trampling of their ancestral land by an alien conqueror should not lead the international community to forget that there exists a distinct entity called Palestine and a distinct people called the Palestinians  whose destiny is indistinguishably linked with the soil on which they have been living since time immemorial. It is our ardent hope that the General Assembly at its present session  by taking adequate measures in this regard  will contribute to the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian Arabs. The immediate and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from all territories of the three Arab countries namely  Egypt  Syria  and Jordan-is another essential prerequisite for the establishment of a durable peace in the Middle East. To deal with the problem in any other way would be  to paraphrase a Persian poem  ""Wiping the tears from our faces without assuaging the anguish from which we weep"".14.	My Government welcomed the spirit that prevailed in the conference of the leaders of Pakistan and India at Simla. It is truly within the spirit of the Charter of this Organization that  at last  in the troubled IndoPakistani subcontinent dialog is beginning to replace the use of arms or the threat of such use. It would be a significant contribution to the victory of the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes to see peace reigning at last over the countries of the subcontinent  and to see Pakistan  Bangladesh and India co-operating in the different spheres of life for the benefit of all the peoples of all three countries.15.	The noble efforts deployed by the United Nations Committee on decolonization  have all the support of the people and the Government of Afghanistan. I would like to reiterate once again our sympathy with  and our backing for  all nations and peoples still struggling for the recognition of their right to self-determination. The abolition of all forms and manifestations of colonialism and imperialism and of racial discrimination and apartheid is a basic objective of the Charter; and all of us present here are bound by our pledges to its provisions and purposes to extend whatever support is at our disposal to the achievement of these goals.16.	For Afghanistan itself  colonialism has left a very unfortunate heritage. It is our hope that the question of Pakhtunistan will be solved on the basis of the right of self-determination for the Pakhtun and Baluchi inhabitants of that land. It is the national and international duty of the people and the Government of Afghanistan to pursue  by all peaceful means at their disposal  the just and noble cause of the people of Pakhtunistan. This problem  in essence  emanated from a very typical colonial injustice.17.	The right of the people of Pakhtunistan freely to choose their own destiny was denied them when the classical form of Western colonialism ended in the Indian subcontinent through its partition a quarter century ago. The land of Pakhtunistan  in spite of not being part of the subcontinent  was added to one of the two new States without its inhabitants having been accorded an opportunity to exercise freely their right to self-determination. The peaceful settlement of this matter is one of the major aims of Afghanistan's foreign policy; but since the question has not been formally put before the General Assembly  it is not our intention to go into further discussion of the problem at this time.18.	The economic development of the under-developed peoples of the world  which unfortunately constitute the majority of the inhabitants of our globe  ii essential not only to the question of international peace and security but also to the well-being-present and future of human society as a whole and to the deceit self-respect of us all. The outcome of the third Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] t held at Santiago in April and May  was a source of genuine disturbance to the small and poor nations of the world  If the menacing gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to widen further  it will soon be very difficult to consider the inhabitants of the world as one human society in the true sense of the word. We hope that this problem will be given sufficient time and consideration during the deliberations of the present session of the General Assembly so that the flame of hope for the future of the developing countries can remain alight.19.	At this juncture one point deserves special mention. As we all know  it is specifically stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J that special measures in favor of the least developed countries should be adopted so as to enable those countries to benefit fully and equitably from the general measures contained in the Strategy. In the view of my Government  the general division of the world into developed and developing countries ii a simplistic view which is no longer valid. The developing world is divided into two groups  developing and least developed. That fact has already been recognized by the International Development Strategy  as well as in numerous resolutions of the various bodies of the United Nations system. Some of the least developed countries are land-locked and are thus doubly handicapped.20.	As I stated earlier  the gap between the developed and the developing countries and between the latter and the least developed among them is fast widening. The identification of the least developed countries is a dramatic phenomenon in the painstakingly slow process of searching for solutions to the socio-economic problems of the countries of the world. The concept of the developing countries as a single group having more similarities than differences proved to be inaccurate. The criteria established for the identification of those .countries demonstrate that they are countries with extremely vulnerable subsistence economies. Two years of continued and severe drought in the case of my country  for example  not only disrupted the precarious economic balance but also plunged the country into unprecedented socio-economic chaos.21.	We agree  as we have often repeated in various international documents that the primary responsibility for the economic development of the developing countries rests upon those countries themselves. But there is another fact  which applies in no case more than it does to the least developed countries: the efforts of those countries for development cannot succeed without urgent  comprehensive and sustained international assistance and co-operation. That fact has been recognized by the developed as well as other developing countries in numerous documents  the most recent of them UNCTAD resolution 62 (III)  which contains specific commitments and measures. It is high time to ascertain to what extent these promises are going to be kept.22.	Efforts during the past several years by a number of countries resulted in the unanimous adoption of resolution 63 (III) at Santiago last spring. That resolution  while not satisfying entirely the needs and claims of the developing land-locked countries  could nevertheless be regarded as a major step in the right direction. As stipulated in numerous studies and resolutions of various United Nations bodies  land-locked developing countries need  first  to adapt their economies to their special geographic situation  and secondly  to sure the free and unrestricted transit of their trade to the sea and to third countries  and vice versa. Those two needs should be satisfied simultaneously and not consecutively. Resolution 63 (III) provides guide-lines for special measures to be taken in both these fields. While the first measures  which are the responsibility of developed countries and international organizations  are of a rather long-term nature  the second set of measures  which are the responsibility of transit countries and international organizations  deserve immediate attention. Such measures as the preparation of a transport strategy and the study of administrative and customs procedures in transit countries could not be carried out without sincere and complete co-operation by the transit countries.23.	We hope that the UNCTAD secretariat  as well as responsible bodies in various international organizations  will take swift and effective measures to implement those decisions of the third session of UNCTAD. We further hope that all countries concerned will adopt a constructive attitude towards these questions and extend their full co-operation to the other parties concerned. The Government of Afghanistan  in co-operation with other land-locked countries  will closely follow developments in this field and is ready to offer its full co-operation and assistance for the implementation of the provisions of UNCTAD resolution 63 (III).24.	We attach substantial importance to the development of the law of the sea along the lines leading to the possibility of access for all the nations of the world to the riches of the sea-bed beyond the limits of the national jurisdiction of individual nations. Special attention must be paid to the status and the needs of the land-locked countries. That is true not only with regard to the riches of the sea-bed but also with regard to freedom of transit and other facilities that are desperately needed for the economic growth of those land-locked countries.25.	Afghanistan in the last three years has had to cope with the catastrophic consequences of a very severe drought. Many Members of the United Nations have generously  and in compliance with the resolution of sympathy adopted by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2757(XXVI)]  extended help and sympathy to our people in their moment of distress. I consider it my duty to express  on behalf of the people and the Government of Afghanistan  our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all those countries which have so kindly extended their aid. I would like especially to thank the former Secretary-General of the United Nations  U Thant  for his message to the various specialized agencies of the United Nations concerned with this problem  and those agencies for the timely help they have rendered in the face of this natural catastrophe.26.	In conclusion  I express the hope that this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly will mark a significant step forward in the deliberations and activities of the United Nations all through the year."
"2",88,"ALB",27,1972,"First  may I  Mr. President  express to you the congratulations of the Albanian delegation on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly.125.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania  like most peace-loving Member States  would have wished to see during the period since the last session of the General Assembly of the United Nations important steps taken towards the creation of a sound and stable international situation  towards the restoration and respect of the sovereign rights of peoples. But the real state of affairs does not allow us to conclude that this wish has been fulfilled.126.	In international relations we observe new tensions caused by the violation of democratic principles and norms which govern relations among States. The American aggression in VietNam and the Israeli imperialist aggression in the Middle East go on. Many important problems of our time remain pending. The two great imperialist Powers  the United States of America and the Soviet Union  have launched a new and general attack against the interests of sovereign peoples and States. The world continues to live in the fear of the threat and the danger coming from those two powers.127.	Today  everyone can easily understand that the United States and the Soviet Union have intensified and perfected their policy of interference and hegemony and have raised to a high level the co-ordination of their concrete activities against the freedom and independence of peoples. Those two Powers are in competition and rivalry for the division of the world into zones of influence and the domination of the world.128.	All Member States have witnessed the maneuvers of the two super-Powers to oppose  by every means  the efforts of peace-loving peoples and countries striving to strengthen and defend their independence and national sovereignty. But no publicity  no pacifist demeanor  no so-called ""great acts"" for the so-called ""safeguard of peace"" and ""progress of mankind"" can mask their well-known imperialist policy and the true designs they pursue separately or in common. We now see their open aggressiveness  their arrogance; everywhere we see their thirst for absolute power over the whole world.129.	Of course  as was said by the leader of the Albanian people  Enver Hoxha:""It would be inconceivable and unrealistic to see in the Soviet-American alliance only the rapprochement and co-operation of the two super-Powers  their common actions and interests. In view of their imperialist character  the United States and the revisionist Soviet Union are also torn asunder by conflicts  rivalries and deep contradictions  which prevent them from acting always in harmony and in complete unity. The existence and aggravation of these contradictions are inherent in the very foundation of that alliance  the capitalist-socialist system of the two countries  and their imperialist designs. Preparing for war  the two parties also plan to devour one another.""130.	But it is also true that peoples  especially small peoples  would run grave risks if they nourished the hope that one of the two great imperialist Powers could take them under its protection. That ""protection"" thus offered is in fact nothing but the integration of these peoples into the zones of influence of these two super-Powers  their domination and their exploitation by the latter.131.	The representatives of the two super-Powers present here have tried to convince us that the talks held between them and the agreements concluded during this year rendered a great service to the world and to the whole of mankind  and they presented the situation as if Member States should now feel more reassured than in the past  and so forth. This is nothing but a fiction  and we firmly reject it.132.	During these talks decisions were taken which impinge upon the vital interests of the peoples of the world. Zones of influence have been confirmed and delimited. Important bargaining has taken place  and this to the prejudice of Viet-Nam  the Arab countries  the European countries and so on. Matters must be judged on the basis of facts  and the facts bear witness to the intensification of the aggressive global strategy of these two super-Powers  which is now carried out in the open  the preparation of new plans and dangerous conspiracies against the peoples and peace in the world.133.	At the present time  both the United States and the Soviet Union are trying to impose the idea that the two super-Powers would be incontrovertible guarantors of peace in the world and arbiters without appeal in international relations  that peoples should sacrifice their national interests for the maintenance of the balance between the two great Powers  upon which the balance of our planet is in turn predicated. These two Powers claim that the destinies of the world  of peace and of international security entirely depend upon them and upon the development of their reciprocal relations and that the improvement or the deterioration of the climate of Soviet-American relations conditions the climate of the whole globe and so on. It has become the practice for the two super-Powers to discuss important international problems directly between themselves and to decide them in accordance with their hegemonic interests without consulting or informing anyone not even their closest allies. Have not their Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and their negotiations on other delicate problems revealed this truth? Nobody claims to know all that is being hatched during these ultra-secret negotiations  but everybody knows full well that not only is a common armaments policy determined in these talks but also a common line and attitude towards others  in all fields and on all matters.134.	Through their policy of hegemony  the American and Soviet imperialists  not content with attempting to create in others a psychosis of fear and of submission to their potential  strength  are also trying openly to deprive peace-loving countries of the possibility of taking part in the solution of problems of concern and interest to the whole world  and to induce these countries to allow the two great Powers to decide behind their backs  in particular behind the backs of the smallest  even questions of direct concern to them. In short  they claim that peoples should abandon their supreme  sovereign rights to the ""two great Powers"". But the peace-loving peoples and countries reject these hegemonic and ultra-chauvinistic preachings and conceptions and firmly oppose the great-Power policy which the United States and the Soviet Union are attempting to impose upon them right here in the United Nations.135.	Now  both the two great imperialist Powers and some others claim that the situation in Europe has undergone an important positive development and that conditions have been created for achieving complete and general security on that continent. To convince us of that  we are being reminded  among other things  of the Bonn-Moscow and Bonn-Warsaw Treaties  the Agreement on Berlin and so on.136.	This whole picture does not reflect reality. In fact  nothing has changed in Europe. On the contrary  the aforementioned agreements have given rise to new tensions  and to the old contradictions  in the East as in the West  others have been added. The United States  the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have redoubled their efforts to acquire dominating positions and new privileges to the detriment of other sovereign European countries.137.	We are of the view that it would be unrealistic to speak of the possibilities of achieving European security when in Europe the United States and the Soviet Union pursue a policy of hegemony and maintain the aggressive military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact  when on the territories of European countries  they have built up a whole network of military bases  where they maintain a large number of troops and organize successive military maneuvers; when Czechoslovakia is still occupied and when the theory of ""limited sovereignty"" is being applied in the countries of Eastern Europe; and when closed European economic groupings  in Eastern and Western Europe  practice discrimination in the field of trade and have become an obstacle to the development of equal co-operation among European countries.138.	We remain faithful also to the viewpoint according to which peace in the world is one and indivisible. There cannot be peace in one part of the world as long as a war of aggression is being waged in another. True peace and security in Europe are inconceivable as long as quite near Europe in the Middle East open aggression and unprecedented imperialist intervention continue; as long as  in the south of the continent in the Mediterranean basin  aggression is increasing by dint of the presence of the aggressive fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union and their military naval bases.139.	In these circumstances  the Albanian delegation would raise the following questions. Why have these aggressive fleets come to the Mediterranean from a distance of thousands of miles without being invited by anyone? Why do they cruise from one end of this sea to the other  aiming their guns at the peaceful shores of the Mediterranean countries and bringing with them the threat of war?140.	The peoples of these countries do not need the defense or the mendacious friendship of American and Soviet imperialists. They know full well the meaning of the mission of these fleets and of the ""gunboat diplomacy"" of the imperialist Powers in this zone. The fact is that the Mediterranean peoples are showing an ever-increasing opposition to the stationing of American and Soviet warships and troops in this zone and to foreign military bases on their shores  and their struggle to turn the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and co-operation is intensifying. They will unfailingly achieve their noble aspirations and bring to heel these new aspirants to the dominion of the seas.141.	The People's Republic of Albania  which expelled the Soviet social-imperialists from its waters when they tried to establish themselves on its shores and become the masters of the country  welcomes and supports the just positions of the peace-loving Mediterranean countries and their legitimate efforts to defend their independence and national sovereignty and free this basin from any policy of hegemony. As in the past  Albania will continue to contribute to efforts in this direction  it considers that the only effective way for the Mediterranean peoples to achieve their aspirations and their will is to take initiatives and undertake energetic and concrete actions. Let the Mediterranean countries on whose territories there are military bases declare that they will liquidate them; let the other Mediterranean countries proclaim that they will not tolerate the establishment of any new foreign military bases on their territories; let the Mediterranean countries which offer to American and Soviet war fleets any facilities and the temporary use of their ports for revictualling  repairs or as a resting place undertake not to assist these fleets in any way; let the Mediterranean countries which now receive visits from these fleets no longer accept them in the future.142.	We think that the implementation of these resolute measures would constitute an important contribution to easing tension and eliminating the existing danger in the Mediterranean  tend to strengthen the national sovereignty of the Mediterranean countries  and also be a positive factor for the consolidation of true peace and security in Europe.143.	That peace and security which the United States and the Soviet Union advocate for Europe is a peace and security which they need in order to consolidate their zones of influence  to preserve their pacts and their military bases and to guarantee the stationing of their troops on the territories of European countries. The ""tranquility"" they promise to create in Europe means security on their flanks so that they can direct the spearhead of their aggressive policy towards the East  especially towards the People's Republic of China.144.	Before speaking of European security  we must clarify this question. Against whom must the peoples of Europe protect themselves  and what are the forces which represent an actual and possible danger? The true and actual danger for Europe at present and in the future comes from the two super-Powers and the German revenge- seekers  and it is against them that the peoples of Europe must be protected. There has never been  and cannot be  any abstract theoretical security. Security is always concrete. It tends to protect against a well-determined threat. To establish European security as proposed and formulated by Moscow and Washington would be tantamount to sanctioning the imperialist interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe  leaving them full leeway to act militarily against peace-loving peoples and nations in other parts of the world. In these conditions  we consider that support for initiatives such as the convening of a conference on European security would facilitate the task of the two super-Powers in their efforts to establish their domination in Europe. A conference organized and manipulated by the American imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists would bring nothing but words and demagoguery and contribute nothing good to European peace and security. It would create and foster nefarious illusions harmful to the effective defense of the freedom and independence of the European peoples.145.	The convening of a conference on European security and preparations for its organization are a part of the Soviet-American collusion that was fully shaped during the most recent talks between the two super-Powers. These preparatory activities and any decisions that might emerge from the conference will bear the tint and seal of the attempts at hegemony of the two super-Powers.146.	We should like to stress that  in the atmosphere of delusion with which the two super-Powers have surrounded the preparations for the conference  some countries which will supposedly take part in it seem to nourish the hope that it will bring them political  economic and other advantages. But we believe that sooner or later these hopes will be dashed  for the two super-Powers will make no concession likely to affect their important mutual interests. All the strings of the conference are in their hands. That is the reason for the wariness and hesitation of various countries about the convening of that conference.147.	The People's Republic of Albania is opposed to that kind of ""European security"". True peace and security in Europe will be achieved only by the concerted efforts of all the peace-loving peoples and countries of Europe  which must themselves take over this cause  strengthen their national independence and their defensive capabilities  oppose unhesitatingly any policy of hegemony and any aggressive activity of the military blocs on their continent and in the neighboring areas  fight to the end for the liquidation of military bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from their territories  while closely linking the fight for their own security to that of all the peoples of the world.148.	We have been witnessing of late a further intensification of the common activity of the United States and the Soviet Union in the so-called field of disarmament  and a great effort on their part to give the impression that they have seriously undertaken this task. All the hullabaloo on the disarmament question is nothing but a smoke-screen to conceal their true designs and to cover up their unbridled arms race. The latest Soviet-American agreements on the so-called limitation of strategic arms  which is being presented to us as a great historical event and a remarkable contribution to peace  far from being a step towards true disarmament and infringing in any way the nuclear monopoly of the two super-Powers  on the contrary encourages them to strengthen their predominant position and their technical and scientific superiority in the field of armaments as well as to maintain the gap they strive to keep between themselves and others. These agreements are a new stage in the continuing arms race through the further perfecting of the strategic nuclear arsenal of the superPowers. And in practice we realize that  while speaking of disarmament  the super-Powers multiply their efforts to arm themselves and increase their military budgets and their armed forces throughout the world  outside their national borders  and that  while they talk about the limitation of strategic nuclear weapons  they increase and perfect their destructive power and increase their expenditures in the field of scientific and technological research in order to invent new weapons of mass destruction.149.	The Albanian delegation considers that it is not the small States and specific areas that should be asked to disarm  because it is not the small States or those areas—for example  it is not the Balkans or other areas  no matter where they may be located-which today threaten international peace and security. True disarmament must begin  in the first place  with the two super-Powers  because it is they who  through their aggressive policy  have become a permanent source of tension and a threat to the freedom and independence of sovereign States. To approach and consider the question of disarmament as advocated by the United States and the Soviet Union would be tantamount to raising the question in a false light and to making the struggle for disarmament a meaningless activity.150.	If the two super-Powers seriously wish to translate their disarmament declarations into deeds  let them do so by concrete and effective action; let them put an end to their policy of war and aggression; let them undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; let them undertake to prohibit the production and use of those weapons and to destroy them completely in accordance with the relevant well-known proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China; let them embark on the road towards the destruction of weapons of mass destruction; let them reduce their armed forces to the levels required by their national defense interests; let them withdraw within their national borders all the troops and fleets they maintain abroad; let them put an end to their practice of extending military bases on the territory of other countries; let them liquidate existing military bases abroad; let them break up their aggressive military blocs and put an end to the arms race under any guise whatever.151.	We have no illusions as to the concrete and actual steps which the two Powers would be ready to take in the field of disarmament. The aggressive nature of American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism remains unchanged and armaments are one of the conditions of the existence of their system. That is why the convening of the world disarmament conference proposed by the Soviet Union is but a propaganda maneuver designed to pass the time by listening to empty speeches  to delude the world  and to give that country an opportunity to act against the peoples of the world and against peace.152.	We consider that peace-loving countries that hold dear the interests of their peoples  of peace and of international security must not let themselves be drawn into the dangerous whirlwind which has been intentionally created by the imperialists  but must redouble their vigilance and fight against die false illusions spread by the two imperialist Powers on disarmament and on the advantages which would supposedly accrue therefrom to the different countries as a result of the resources released by disarmament. They must increase their defensive military potential and multiply their self-defense efforts in order to be in a position to face possible attack as well as the permanent threat to their independence and freedom stemming from the aggressive policy of the United States and the Soviet Union. The peoples do not expect true disarmament from the two great imperialist Powers. They will achieve it through a resolute struggle against them and their imperialist conspiracy.153.	At the very center of world public opinion we find  as in the past  Viet-Nam and IndoChina  where die United States of America for many years has been continuing its infamous aggression. World public opinion has severely condemned the barbarous and inhuman acts of the American army  insistently demanding that an end be put forthwith to United States armed intervention  that American soldiers immediately leave South Viet-Nam and the IndoChinese peninsula and that the VietNamese people be left free to settle its own national problems  without any foreign interference and in accordance with its own wishes. But  in defiance of the will of all peoples and of all international principles and rules  the United States Government continues its aggression with unheard-of obstinacy and cynicism. Now the United States is in an impasse and  stunned by successive defeats  it goes from one crime to another  from one mistake to another. The serious situation in which it finds itself in Viet-Nam has not been lightened by the new measures of intensification and VietNamization of the war or by the successive escalations of criminal aggression against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. The mining and blockading of ports and the destruction of dikes accompanied by demagogic promises about the so-called withdrawal of American troops from Viet-Nam and the disengagement of the United States from IndoChina-promises to which President Nixon is now resorting for the purposes of his electoral campaign-have not yielded and will not yield any result. The words of the #United States President that he wants to achieve the withdrawal of his troops from Viet-Nam and IndoChina are nothing but a delusion which can deceive only the naive. It is quite clear now that the United States  through armed aggression and diplomatic maneuvers  is striving to reach its well-known objective in that part of the world  to makeSouth Viet-Nam  like the other parts of the IndoChinese peninsula  a base of aggression against the peace-loving countries of South-East Asia as well as against the national liberation movements in the area.154.	In the pursuance of these objectives  the United States does not cease to benefit from the assistance of the Soviet leaders  who  in turn  make their own calculations and seek to draw advantages from this problem which concerns the whole world. While they say they are the great champions of Viet-Nam  the Soviet leaders have never ceased to exert pressure on the VietNamese people  to sabotage and restrain their just struggle in order to save the United States from the shameful defeat awaiting it in Viet-Nam  as they do moreover in regard to the struggle for the liberation of the people of Cambodia  by maintaining their links with the Lon Nol clique and not recognizing the legitimate Chief of State  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  the sole and true legitimate representative of the Cambodian people.155.	Recent events have brought clearly to light the whole of the collusion on Viet-Nam between the United States and the Soviet Union. There can be no other interpretation of the attitude of the Soviet leaders  who not only did not lift a little finger when President Nixon of the United States proclaimed the mining and blockade of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and launched air attacks of unprecedented magnitude against that country but have used these American actions as a pretext to stop the small supply of military assistance that they may have sent it. The war in Viet-Nam has in no way altered the American- Soviet idyll and the state of relations between the two super-Powers  which are agreed that the people of Viet-Nam should not achieve their freedom and independence and that the Americans should not be expelled from Viet-Nam and IndoChina.156.	But the people of Viet-Nam have not permitted and will never permit others to play with the blood of their sons fallen on the field of honor; they are determined to fight-in unity with the peoples of Cambodia and Laos while benefiting from the powerful support of the great Chinese people and from international solidarity with the peace-loving peoples of the world to win the final victory over the imperialist American aggressors and solve their own problems  as they have decided to do in keeping with their supreme national interests. There is no doubt that a true and just peace will be established in Viet-Nam and throughout IndoChina and it will be achieved through the resolute struggle of the heroic peoples of IndoChina. It will be obtained only when the United States is compelled completely and definitely and without conditions to withdraw its aggressive troops from that area  when it dismantles its bases and withdraws its military equipment  when it ceases to encourage and give support to its henchmen in IndoChina.157.	The development of events in the Middle East in the current year has again shown not only that the aggression against the Arab Republic of Egypt  Syria and other peaceful Arab countries continues but that the Israeli Zionists are embarking more and more along this course and insist obstinately on their absurd expansionist claims and ambitions in regard to such countries. While in the occupied Arab territories they practice an unbridled policy of de-nationalization and apply racism  on the political level  starting from positions of strength  they seek to legalize the fruits of armed aggression and to dictate their will to the Arab peoples. In the meantime the United States does not cease to give Israel unreserved political and moral support and to supply it with the most modern weapons in unlimited quantities. The Soviet Union  although it passes for a champion of the just cause of the Arab peoples  indulges in a double play and creates obstacles for them in their just struggle for the liberation of the occupied territories and the defense of their national interests  which is tantamount to encouraging openly the Israeli Zionists to continue their aggression. While the United States provides Israel with weapons  the Soviet Union for its part supplies it with a qualified live force by sending to that country tens of thousands of Soviet Jews. The two partners thus jointly satisfy the needs of Israel  enabling it to continue its aggression against the Arab States. The Soviet Union  in connivance with the United States  has endeavored and still endeavors entirely and definitely to liquidate the Palestinian affair.158.	The two super-Powers have never been in favor of a true solution of the Middle East problem. In keeping with the objectives of their over-all strategy in that area  they speculate on the temporary difficulties of the Arab countries and  as can be seen also from their recent common attitude  they do the impossible to maintain the situation of ""no war  no peace"" as it is called  which means the maintenance of their positions and their political  economic and military influence in that area.159.	The leader of the Albanian people  Enver Hoxha  at the Sixth Congress of the Labor PArty of Albania  held in November last year  stated:""The Zionists  the imperialists and the revisionists endeavor to divide the Arabs and to sow discord among them  with the intent of weakening their common front of anti-imperialist liberation and imposing on them a peace that is contrary to their vital interests. The two super-Powers  which seek to take into their hands the destinies of the Middle East and to play there the role of arbiter  propose to divide it into zones of influence and to build on the ruins of the Arab peoples new bases from which they would set out on new conquests in the Asian and African continent.""But if the Arab peoples have fought for centuries for their freedom and independence  for the defense of their honor and their property  it is not in order to sacrifice them now to the imperialist interests of the great Powers. The price of the peace that the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists offer them is very high. Further  it is an insult to them and a serious affront to the glorious traditions  the dignity and pride of all the Arab peoples. Those peoples have clearly made it known that they will not renounce even an inch of Arab land and that there will be no bargaining on the Palestinian question.""160.	The recent measures adopted by the Arab Republic of Egypt to expel the Soviet advisers and military experts dealt a serious blow to the Soviet expansionist policy in theMiddle East; they revealed the dangerous conspiracies that the Soviet social-imperialists are plotting with the American imperialists against the Arab peoples and the other peoples.161.	These measures represent an important step towards the consolidation of Egypt's independence and State sovereignty and once again confirm what we  the Albanians  have been saying for a long time  namely  that the Soviet revisionists do not give their weapons to the Arab States to help them in their struggle against Zionist imperialist aggression  but rather to tie their hands and to become tomorrow the masters of those countries in order to install themselves at their ease in the Middle East. We have said this not from drawing abstract  political conclusions but also and above all by drawing our conclusions from the hostile policy of the Soviet Khrushchevian revisionists who have sought to occupy our ports and turn Albania into an arsenal for their own ends. But the Albanian people have unhesitatingly unmasked their diabolical plans.162.	The lesson to be drawn from recent events in Egypt is that sovereign peoples and countries cannot rely on the weapons and ""assistance"" provided by the two great imperialist Powers who seek to impose on them their domination.163.	The Soviet leaders are not in the habit of speaking of their defeats. That is why  again this time  they attempt to minimize the whole affair. They present things as if the military advisers expelled from Egypt ""have acquitted themselves with honor of their tasks and are now going back home"". One may well wonder what tasks they acquitted themselves of with honor? Would it be by chance their attempt to halt the Arab peoples in their just struggle for the liberation of the occupied territories  or would it be their attempt to maintain in the Middle East the status quo  which favors Israel and the Soviet- American designs of expansion.164.	Peace in the Middle East will not be instituted either by the United States or the Soviet Union  nor by these two Powers together  nor by resolutions adopted on their initiative nor through missions proposed and manipulated by them  but by the firm struggle of the Arab peoples  in close unity  against the Zionist aggressors and the plots of the two super-Powers. The Israeli aggressors must definitely and without conditions leave all the occupied Arab territories and put an end to their policy of aggression and armed provocation against the peace-loving Arab peoples. The Palestinian rights must be recognized and restored.165.	The peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America aspire  like all peoples  to live in freedom and independence  to become masters within their frontiers. But  despite the great changes that have taken place and are taking place  the imperialist Powers do not renounce their old colonial possessions and brutally apply there the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. That is why the whole of Africa is in ferment today and everywhere we witness armed liberation struggles for the liberation and independence of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau)  the Cape Verde Islands  Namibia  and South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Northern Ireland patriots fight  weapons in hand  against colonial oppression and the terror of the British leading circles. The People of Puerto Rico stubbornly seek to shake off the imperialist yoke. In the United States itself  rebellion and the movement of protest of the blacks against racial discrimination do not cease to grow and expand.166.	The imperialist Powers  and first of all the United States and the Soviet Union  obstinately apply a very marked neo-colonialist policy. They exploit and plunder other peoples  particularly those that have recently acquired freedom from colonial oppression.167.	It is not my intention to dwell at length here on the forms of domination and the hateful practices of these Powers in those countries  but  as the representative of a country the noble principle underlying whose policy is the support of peoples fighting for freedom and independence  I cannot remain silent in the face of the fact that these countries are the object of the greed of neo-colonialists who threaten their political independence and sovereignty  nor can I fail at the same time to express the full solidarity of our people with their just  anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.168.	The United States and the Soviet Union have already agreed and co-ordinated their action relating to their so-called aid to other countries. All their assistance is subordinated to political and military conditions and is calculated to preserve intact the status quo in the distribution of their zones of influence  to hinder the extension of national liberation struggles  and to prevent the creation of situations which might endanger the interests of the super-Powers.169.	We applaud the struggle of the peaceful countries of Latin America and other countries which defend their national and territorial integrity and national jurisdiction against the hegemonic designs of the two super-Powers. We firmly support the just measures taken by Algeria  Iraq  Libya and other main petroleum-producing countries  as well as Chile  Peru  Ecuador  and other Latin American countries  and countries of Africa and Asia  to defend their independence and sovereignty  as well as their property and their national rights. The People's Republic of Albania will never cease to support their just cause.170.	Peace-loving peoples and countries are strong enough to stand up to the threat and dangers to which the two super-Powers subject them  and we are convinced that that firm resolve to defend their honor and independence cannot be destroyed by any Power however great and strongly armed it may be. The great People's China  that great socialist Power which is developing rapidly and continues to move forward  has become a great factor of peace and security in the world. It represents a definite support for the struggle of peoples and countries for freedom and national independence and social progress an insurmountable obstacle to the aggressive hegemony plans of the two super-Powers.171.	The whole of progressive mankind enthusiastically applauded last year the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations  a glowing victory of the great Chinese People's Republic and of its just external policy  and at the same time a victory for all the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world. That was the crowning of the struggle that Member States  including the People's Republic of Albania  have carried on unceasingly for over 20 years to put an end to the unprecedented situation that had been created in our Organization.172.	The presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has notably strengthened the struggle of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist forces even here in the Organization  as well as the struggle of peace-loving member States against the two great imperialist Powers and in favor of the defense of the rights of peoples and the cause of peace. But with the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations only a first step  although an important one  was taken along the path leading to the enhancement of the authority and effectiveness of the Organization. Many other measures will have to be adopted in order that the Organization may live up to the provisions of the Charter and the demands of our times.173.	We note that the United Nations is still powerless to fulfill the tasks for which it was created  to make its contribution to the solution of important problems that are of concern to the world today. This is borne out by many recent and numerous events. The inability of the United Nations was clearly manifested in the case of the armed aggression perpetrated by India last year  with the support of the Soviet social-imperialists  against Pakistan  an aggression that led to the brutal dismemberment of the territory of a sovereign Member State. Now we are asked to recognize and legalize that situation created by violence. That inability or ineffectiveness is clearly noticeable  too  in the failure of efforts to solve the Middle East question; in the interminable debates on disarmament; in the legalization thereby of many dangerous conspiracies of the two super-Powers; in the non-implementation of many decisions concerning colonial problems  and so on.174.	Our Organization's past and present inadmissible attitude in regard to the peace-loving Korean people is also obvious proof of its weakness and the deadlock in which it finds itself. Everyone knows not only that the United Nations has been used to cover up the barbarous aggression of the United States and its allies against the Korean people  but also that its flag serves even today to camouflage the maintenance in South Korea of American aggressive troops  which have brought to the population of that part of Korea untold suffering and misery  which constantly indulge in armed provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and aggravate tension in the Far East. The existence  for 20 years  of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea constitutes another aspect of the flagrant interference of the United Nations in the internal affairs of the Korean people and is a clear violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter.175.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania  condemning once again most strongly the serious acts committed against the Korean people  emphasizes that if the Organization wishes to make its contribution to this question  it must as soon as possible adopt the decision demanded for a long time  first of all by the Korean people but also by all peace-loving peoples  to dissolve without delay the unlawful Commission on Korea and immediately to withdraw American aggressive troops from South Korea. Those are the first urgent measures to be adopted. Only thus can we prevent discrediting further this Organization on this question. The Korean people must be left free to decide its own destiny in accordance with its wishes and without any interference from outside and to realize its legitimate national aspirations and the reunification of its country.176.	In the opinion of the Albanian delegation it is also necessary to restore without delay the legitimate rights of the Kingdom of Cambodia  whose place in the United Nations must be occupied by representatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  the only legitimate representatives of the Cambodian people. This requires the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Lon Nol clique. As for the request for the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Lon Nol clique  such a decision would be in keeping with the tenets of justice  the sovereign right of the people of Cambodia and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.177.	The present international situation and the interests of enhancing and strengthening the capacity and role of the United Nations impose on all its Member States  and all those who are attached to the fundamental principles of its Charter and who respect them  the need to co-ordinate their efforts and to intensify their struggle to free the United Nations from the American-Soviet maneuvers and to place it on the right course.178.	Those were some of the main problems in the international situation on which the delegation of Albania wished to express the point of view of its Government. But at the beginning of the work of this session the question of terrorism was raised  and the United States delegation made a lot of noise about it.179.	Our attitude concerning terrorism is well known. We do not approve of it. But the Albanian delegation could not fail to highlight the fact that the timing and manner of presentation of this question show that the aim is  in the name of ""the struggle against terrorism""  to strike at the national liberation struggles "" the sacred right of peoples to use every means to fight to recover and safeguard their freedom and independence. It is clear that the United States and those who support it are endeavoring to use this question to distract world public opinion from the monstrous crimes which they are committing in Viet-Nam and throughout Indochina  the barbarous acts of terror perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people  Lebanon  and all the other Arab peoples  the savage racial oppression and genocide practiced in certain African countries  and so forth.180.	Peace-loving Member States must not be hoodwinked by American maneuvers  but must unmask the true terror  the crimes and barbarous acts of the imperialists. They must struggle against the policy of aggression and expansion  against the policy of oppression and colonial exploitation which have brought untold suffering and misery to the world.181.	The People's Republic of Albania which consistently follows a just foreign policy of principle  of resolute defense of the lofty interests of the Albanian people  of unreserved support for the struggle of peoples and sovereign countries for their freedom  national independence and social progress and for peace and international co-operation-will  as in the past  always side with peace-loving peoples and countries and will spare no effort to help them to achieve the triumph of their common cause  to accede to genuine peace and ensure the defense of their supreme national interests. At this session once again  the Albanian delegation  in conformity with this just attitude of its socialist country  will unite its efforts with those of the delegations of other progressive countries and will make its fullest contribution to the realization of these high and noble objectives."
"3",156,"ARE",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is with great pleasure that I extend to you the congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session. Poland and the Arab nation  of which my country is an integral part  have had for many years the closest and most friendly relations.147.	May I also express our appreciation for the brilliant manner in which Mr. Adam Malik  the illustrious Foreign Minister of Indonesia  presided over the previous session.148.	We also wish our new Secretary-General success in the discharge of his important responsibilities.149.	In this first year of our independence  our main task has been to find our proper place and role in the international community  a place and role determined by our history  geographical position  economic resources and  above all  by the desires and expectations of our people.150.	Our Union is open to all Arab countries in the Gulf area and elsewhere. We are firm believers in the ideal of Arab unity and we hope that our example will reverse the trend towards fragmentation and division in the Arab world and herald a new era in which the Arab nation will be able to play a beneficent and significant role in world affairs which its history  its culture and its resources entitle it to play. We have fully identified ourselves with the fundamental positions of principle taken by the Arab countries within the framework of the League of Arab States  of which we are now a member.151.	The question euphemistically called ""The situation in the Middle East"" [item 21]  and which I would prefer to call by its proper name ""the question of Palestine""  remains the central national issue for the Arab people. Essentially it is the plight of a people dispossessed and driven out of its homeland by a colonialist armed invasion. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their fundamental rights in their ancestral homeland  there can be no settlement  nor peace in the Middle East.152.	A good deal has been said recently about the problem of terrorism. Israel  of course  has been attempting to derive some propaganda advantage and to exploit a very serious human problem  so characteristic of our times  to achieve narrow and selfish political gains and to set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and the fulfillment of its well-known expansionist aims. I am certain that the General Assembly will not be diverted by these crude and obvious maneuvers from its duty to discuss the issue with the sense of sober responsibility it deserves.153.	The people of Palestine have waited in vain for a quarter of a century for some redress of the grave injustice inflicted upon them. The international community  whose collective will this Organization represents  has seemed to be oblivious to their plight and through its inaction  over the years  has implicitly acquiesced in Israel's aggression. Israel was founded and has maintained itself by the systematic and ruthless practice of terror: terror which drove the majority of Palestinians out of their homeland  terror which deprived them of freedom and dignity  terror which made the remnants who stayed behind second-class citizens in their own country  terror which pursued them in their unhappy exile  in their wretched refugee camps  and slaughtered them by the hundreds. We do not and cannot condone the killing of innocent people  but how can we equate the desperate acts of a few individuals driven by ""misery  frustration  grievance and despair""  to quote the Secretary-General's words [see Aj8791/Add.l]  with the brutal  deliberate and cold-blooded acts of indiscriminate killing perpetrated by the armed forces of a State? Let us not make the mistake of thinking that these are acts of revenge; they are concerned primarily with the achievement of long-standing strategic and political aims.154.	Our geographical position in the Gulf has given us a vital interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavored to establish the closest relations with our neighbors. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Gulf region can be maintained only with the co-operation of its States and with their respect for one another's independence and territorial integrity. Whatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests. We are ready now  as we have always been  to co-operate with our neighbors to create a climate of understanding and harmony  which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people. The peace and security of the Gulf will be greatly enhanced by making the Indian Ocean region a zone of peace. We support the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on this question [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and will welcome any further action at this session to ensure its implementation.155.	We are meeting at a time of rapid and sometimes dramatic change in the world situation. There have been unmistakable and welcome signs of a detente among the great Powers  a development of great importance in view of the fact that under the Charter these States have a primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is our hope that this is the beginning of an irreversible trend towards a greater degree of genuine international co-operation and not merely a temporary interruption in the cold war. Thus  on the central problem of war and peace we are entitled to express some cautious optimism. There are certainly some clear and concrete grounds for such optimism: the agreement on the partial limitation of strategic weapons  the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland  the four-Power agreement on Berlin and the understanding reached between the two Governments of Korea  which may lead to the unification of that country. These encouraging developments have paradoxically given rise to some anxiety among the smaller countries. There is a feeling that the reduction of tensions among the great Powers may lead to the imposition of solutions to international problems that will ignore the desires and interests of other countries  especially those directly concerned. We hope that these fears are un-founded.156.	As we look at the agenda of this session  we still see some of the problems which have been dealt with by this Organization since its inception  such as colonialism and apartheid. A genocidal war is being waged against the African people who are struggling to free themselves from colonial domination. The racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to flout the will of the international community  encouraged by their undiminished trade with their Western trading partners and the continued flow of investments from abroad.157.	In their meeting held in Cairo earlier this month  the Arab Foreign Ministers issued a declaration on South East Asia affirming the solidarity of the Arab States with the peoples of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos in their struggle for national liberation and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from their lands. The declaration also condemned the aggression to which those countries have been subjected.158.	It will be unnecessary for me to dwell upon the serious economic problems facing the developing countries and the failure of all attempts to narrow the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Perhaps nowhere is the tendency of certain advanced countries to take decisions affecting others more pronounced than it is in economic matters. Problems relating to the international monetary system and trade are discussed and dealt with by the major Powers without much concern for the vital interests of the developing countries. The third session of UNCTAD revealed the problem facing' the developing countries in all its painful dimensions. It is obvious that the developing countries have to strengthen and expand the co-operation among themselves and that they should shift their emphasis from exhortations addressed to the developed countries  which have largely fallen on deaf ears  to the greater possibilities of cooperation among themselves.159.	We have established a development fund with an initial capital of over $100 million to assist the countries of the region in their plans of development. Over and above this  we are also ready to contribute  within the limits of our means  to the various international and regional development activities undertaken by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.160.	There is undoubtedly a close link between the problems of development and disarmament. If only a fraction of the billions being squandered on the arms race were diverted to the urgent needs of the developing countries  then the whole depressing picture which con-fronts us today would be transformed beyond recognition. For this reason we support the convening of an inter-national conference on disarmament  with a view to the reduction and ultimate elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.161.	An event of great importance this year has been the adoption of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the machinery being established to put into effect the principles and aims of that Declaration.162.	I finally come to the question of the United Nations and the strengthening of its role and efficacy. This has always been a major concern of the smaller countries  such as my own. It stems from the belief that only through the United Nations can we translate into living reality the principles and ideals which bind us together. But it would be idle to pretend that the United Nations is not now  and has not been for some years  passing through a period of decline. The Organization has been purposely and rigorously prevented from playing any role in some crucial international problems. The United Nations has been rendered virtually powerless  through the obstruction of certain great Powers  to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Palestine  the Middle East  apartheid and colonialism. But we must first of all recognize that there are certain inherent weaknesses in the Charter itself. The Charter is  after all  a document which was drawn up before the advent of the nuclear age when a vast number of countries were still under foreign rule.163.	The Charter is also based on two basic assumptions which have been largely overtaken by the spectacular developments of the last quarter of a century. The two assumptions are that the hegemony of the great Powers will always be accepted as a permanent fact of international life and that the great Powers will  more often than not  act together to deal with major international problems. How-ever  in spite of its structural defects and the invalidity of its basic assumptions  the Charter is flexible enough to enable us to transform it into an effective instrument of the international order which we envisage for the future.164.	As a token of our faith in the United Nations and confidence in its future  my Government has decided to respond favourably to the appeal of the Secretary-General and make a contribution which we hope will help to alleviate the financial difficulties facing the Organization."
"4",203,"ARG",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Argentine Government  I am pleased to offer you our congratulations on the election as President of the General Assembly of an outstanding son of Poland  a nation with which Argentina enjoys close ties of friendship. We are convinced that your ability and your experience in international problems will ensure success in the deliberations of the Assembly. May I request you to transmit to Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  the appreciation of the Argentine delegation for the brilliant way in which he guided the work of the twenty-sixth session.2.	At the end of that session  U Thant relinquished his post and we elected a new Secretary-General; at that time the Argentine delegation expressed from the rostrum [2031st meeting] its appreciation to U Thant for his untiring work in the service of our Organization. The efforts made by Mr. Kurt Waldheim in the course of this year strengthen our conviction that his election was well advised and that his talents and ability will contribute effectively to the fulfillment of the goals of the United Nations.3.	There seems to be no disagreement that the present international system is a multi-polar one  whose various centers of political  economic and socio-cultural power have imposed a dynamism on present-day events that had not been experienced in the post-war years. There can be no doubt that all types of relations among States have become more fluid and articulate and that our Organization has achieved a degree of universality which was unknown during earlier decades. It is also evident that ideological differences have given way to a more pragmatic and realistic approach to problems affecting international life 4.	We cannot but express our satisfaction that the cold- war stance has been abandoned and that dialog and negotiations have been accepted as a way of achieving peaceful solutions to the controversies among States. Long-divided countries have managed to approach their reunification or have devised procedures permitting more intensive economic  social and cultural relations. All these are also signs of the gradual disappearance of the bipolar system and a relaxation of tensions which have always been encouraged by my country.5.	However  the existence of these events must not lead us to lose sight of the need to watch very closely the development of trends within the system itself. Despite the multi-polarity  it is undeniable that the medium and smaller nations remain only marginally involved in the adoption of decisions that affect them directly.6.	In his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization submitted to the Assembly  the Secretary- General has very rightly pointed out that  ""the interests  the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot  at this point in history  be ignored in any durable system of world order"" [A/ 8701/Add.l  p. 2]. Pursuant to this line of thought  nothing would be more dangerous than to convert the present multi-polarity into a static system of balance of power. This would spell a new division of the world into spheres of influence by the super-Powers and the larger nations  with the obvious exclusion of a large number of States. The peace and security to which we aspire are not those leading to a rigid situation which would curtail development possibilities  because they could alter the balance achieved. Stability in peace does not mean the freezing of acquired positions  but rather the opening up of new possibilities to ensure a more just and worthy world.7.	In the decade of the 1970s  the United Nations cannot confine itself to endorsing the acts of the great Powers. It has often been alleged that voting at the United Nations is the performance of a mere ritual. It well may be that this forum has served on numerous occasions to offer the great Powers a way out -a fitting way of saving face at times when  had they continued to follow a selfish or mistaken policy  they might have plunged our world into new and serious conflicts.A/PV.20438.	This role played by the United Nations should not be disdained. In recent times  however  the membership of the United Nations has altered considerably due to the admission of a majority of countries that either became in-dependent after the Second World War or were not direct contenders in that conflict. Those countries are confronting serious problems of all types and are endeavoring to narrow the gap that separates them from the great Powers as rapidly as possible. Perhaps precisely because of this development lag  their views may differ from those of the great Powers with regard to the analysis of and solutions to their problems and presumably they may consider foreign any approach to them that does not take into account their own needs.9.	All this leads us to believe that  if the United Nations is to live up to the purposes that dictated its creation  it must assume new functions more in keeping with the present day reality. It is a fact  for example  that the policy of great-Power confrontation has yielded  at least in many cases  to a policy of co-operation; talks have started on fundamental matters; substantive agreements have been arrived at on questions of concern to all. We hope that this attitude of co-operation can be extended to embrace all the countries of the system. But the Organization should also give increasing attention to the problems and the needs of each and every one of its Members. The world of today is an indivisible unit  and the conflicts  problems or situations afflicting one State or one region not only interest  but also affect  all the others.10.	The Security Council bears an enormous responsibility for the analysis and proposal of solutions to conflicts among States. We do not believe that there are universal prescriptions; we believe that each case must be considered on its own merits  and the onus of implementing measures recommended by the Security Council falls on the parties concerned. While serving as a member of the Security Council  Argentina has maintained a position of strict independence in dealing with the different questions raised and has at all times endeavored to contribute in a constructive way to the solution of the problems examined by that organ.11.	We attach singular importance to the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa at the beginning of this year. The positive results obtained proved the wisdom of the initiative taken by the three African members of the Council who proposed that the Council should hold meetings away from Headquarters.12.	Latin America is the natural framework for Argentine foreign policy affairs  and my country has concentrated its efforts within that area. The various visits by the President of Argentina to other countries of South America bespeak clearly the priority attached by my Government to the ties with the sister Republics of the continent. Through these visits and the presidential talks held on Argentine soil  we have established procedures for consultation and co-ordination in order to ensure greater success in our joint efforts to solve our common problems. This policy has led to solid achievements aimed at enhancing our physical  economic  scientific and cultural integration.13.	The countries of Latin America are not only linked by a common historical tradition  but they are also part of a community of necessary interdependence.  We are all protagonists in a process where the fate of each one affects that of the others and where all are called upon to play a major role.14.	Within the United Nations the Latin American countries have performed and continue to perform a vital function. We have been unswerving defenders of the Charter and of the principles of international law and advocates of peaceful settlement of disputes. We have made common cause with the new nations that have emerged into independent life since 1945 and we have always given support to all measures designed to end colonialism  eliminate racial discrimination and do away with economic differences among peoples. In this way we have been true to the principles that are deeply rooted in the national character of each of our countries  whose populations comprise all races of the world. This is a matter of particular pride and deserves special mention in a parliament that does in fact represent the international community as a whole.15.	We wish to express our agreement with the comments on the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment made by Mr. Waldheim in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l  p. 5] and with your own words  Mr. President  in your opening statement of this session [2032nd meeting]. The problems of the environment have been a constant concern to my country and that is why  when the item was first discussed in the Economic and Social Council  Argentina was one of the first countries to support the holding of the Stockholm Conference and participated actively in the preparatory work for it.16.	The most constructive element that emerges from the report of the Conference  is the establishment of international co-operation in the field of the human environment. In accordance with its recommendations and its Declaration  this co-operation is carried out through an exchange of information and collaboration among States. The Conference reflects what experience and practice  science and technology  doctrine and jurisprudence have been teaching us for a long time.17.	In this field Latin America was ahead of the Stockholm achievements by including in joint declarations of its Presidents and Foreign Ministers the principles which were later approved by the Conference.v18.	In this  as in any other questions touching the international community  the Argentine Republic upholds the principle of the exercise of sovereignty whereby States perform any acts necessary within their own territory to carry out their national policies. Argentina also maintains that modern States must exercise this sovereignty in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law  respecting therefore the same sovereign rights of other States.19.	In order to achieve a harmonious interplay of this simultaneous exercise of sovereignty on the part of different States  a system of exchange of information is necessary to comply  effectively and appropriately  with the principles of good neighborliness. Without it  international co-operation as advocated by the Stockholm Conference would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.20.	Argentina attaches special significance to the problems relating to the law of the sea. We have participated actively in the work of the sea-bed Committee  and  together with other countries of Latin America  we have upheld the right of the coastal State to extend its sovereignty over the sea adjacent to its shores to a distance of 200 maritime miles and we have reaffirmed its sovereign rights over the continental shelf. This position is based on the provisions of international law and on the imperative need to protect and defend the resources that lie close to our coasts. The Declarations of Montevideo  and Lima and more recently that of Santo Domingo-clearly reflect the responsibility assumed by the majority of the countries of Latin America. Many countries of Africa and Asia that have also had to face the need to adopt measures within the framework of contemporary' international law are joining in this process  to preserve and protect the resources of the sea  the sea-bed and the subsoil of the maritime areas within their jurisdiction and adjacent to their costs.21.	The task of the future United Nations conference on the law of the sea is to harmonize these rights and interests with those of the international community; its results should bring the benefits of juridical security and justice of a new and more equitable order to this important area of international relations. Therefore  careful study should be given to the preparatory work of the Conference that will be convened  we understand  when the general lines of agreement have been reached and when the enlarged Committee on the sea-bed has fulfilled its mandate. These preparatory efforts and the careful timing of the conference should ensure its positive outcome.22.	The Argentine Republic continues to follow with increased interest the evolution of events in the Middle East. Our logical concern over the state of affairs prevailing in that region is due to our conviction that international peace is indivisible. For this reason it is imperative that a just and lasting peace be established in that area. We repeat that the strict implementation of the principles and obligations set forth in resolution 242(1967) of the Security Council-to whose adoption the Argentine delegation contributed significantly-is still the basic point of departure to achieve that goal. The conflict has lasted far too long and the different stages that mark its development have left many wounds that are difficult to heal  but they have also taught lessons and given much experience that must not be wasted.23.	To conclude peace  the highest gifts of statesmanship are required from all.; They must manifest themselves not only in the sincere will to negotiate and to moderate their positions  but also in their sense of timing  which  I would venture to say  is a trait of fundamental importance.1 The tragedy of opportunities missed haunts peoples for genera-tions and the Argentine Government is ready to continue contributing actively to avoid such a tragedy occurring in the Middle East.24.	The Argentine Republic has always stated from this rostrum that it totally and unconditionally rejects all types of discrimination and colonialism. For this reason we note with concern that forms of domination still exist that are incompatible with human dignity and with the clear awareness of present day man  who does not accept so-called racial superiorities.25.	It is a commonplace to state today that colonialism has been overcome. It is a fact that a wide majority of the territories that suffered foreign domination have now acceded to independent life and have taken their place in this Organization. But the unfortunate fact is that a number of colonial situations still exist and it is our duty not to waver for a single moment in our efforts until the last vestige of that unjust and anachronistic dependence has been totally and forever eradicated.26.	Namibia is a typical example  among others. Solely and exclusively to obtain self-determination  and independence for Namibia as soon as possible a step too long postponed-Argentina has proposed legal and political formulas that were given unanimous support by the voting members of the Security Council in February and August of this year [Council resolutions 309 (1972) and 319 (1972)]. We prefer to believe in the evolution of governments  governments that cannot forever turn their backs on the realities surrounding them. Therefore  we still trust that good sense will prevail and that the aspirations of the peoples of Namibia and of the international community  endorsed by a decision of the International Court of Justice   will be satisfied  and that this will take place immediately in a peaceful and orderly manner.27.	The unwavering anti-colonialist stand of the Argentine Republic  which I reaffirm now  is not the simple expression of a feeling that we share with the vast majority of nations represented here. In our view  colonialism is not a historical phenomenon whose consequences afflict others nor is it a problem of which we have acquired vicarious knowledge. It is an actual fact that we ourselves are experiencing.28.	At present  after more than a century and a half of independent life  there still subsists on Argentine soil a residue of that outgrown stage of imperial expansion. It is precisely in order to wipe out that negative vestige of an obsolete past that the Argentine Government is conducting negotiations with the Government of the United Kingdom within the framework of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) in order to find a final solution to the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands.29.	In order to encourage ties between the Malvinas Islands and the mainland and as a result of instruments approved by both countries  efforts have been made which facilitate communications  increase mutual knowledge and benefit the population of the Malvinas. In May of this year  notes were signed and exchanged in Buenos Aires which provided for the construction in the islands  by the Argentine Republic  of an airport which will be capable of dealing with the regular transport of passengers  cargo and5 Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)  Advisory Opinion  I.C.J. Reports 1971  p. 16.mail and which will begin to operate in the next few weeks to replace the amphibious aircraft at present being used.30.	Despite these practical steps of undisputed importance  there still remain differences between the two Governments regarding the circumstances required for a final solution of the question of sovereignty. Further talks on the matter are to be held and we trust that they will be fruitful. The final outcome can be none other than the return of the Malvinas Islands to the Argentine territorial heritage.31.	The United Kingdom is a country to which we are linked by traditional and cordial ties of friendship and one which has given repeated proof of its clear-sighted approach to the realities of the present day world. We are therefore confident that this case will be no exception. We reiterate that only thus can the obstacle affecting good relations between our two countries be removed for once and for all.32.	The Argentine Government  which has given proof of reflection and moderation throughout these negotiations in the search for a peaceful solution to the question  hopes that it will not be delayed without justification. We shall thus have fully complied with the terms of paragraph 1 of resolution 2065 (XX)  which  furthermore  coincides with the universal desire to put a speedy end to colonial situations all over the world.33.	Disarmament still continues to be one of the most urgent and important questions of the day. During the last two sessions of the General Assembly  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament submitted for our consideration the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction  which were subsequently adopted [resolutions 2660 (XXV) and 2826 (XXVI)]. My Government has subscribed to both  since they were instruments that had been the subject of delicate multilateral negotiations in which all parties acted with the greatest care and flexibility in order to arrive at balanced formulas which undoubtedly contribute to the strengthening of international peace and security.34.	With regard to chemical weapons  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is not  this year  submitting to the General Assembly an agreed draft convention on weapons of mass destruction of this type  whose dangers are obvious and whose elimination is imperative. We must remember that  because of the relatively low costs of these weapons  they can be developed and produced by many countries. Therefore an agreement on chemical weapons should be acceptable to all States  not only to the great Powers. The negotiations are thus much more complex  since so many views reflecting well-founded concerns must be brought together.35.	Thanks to the patient work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  the international community has made some progress in the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Little enough has been achieved  how-ever  in regard to nuclear weapons  apart from some collateral measures of dubious practical effectiveness and  in some ways  of a discriminatory nature.36.	Within the more restricted framework of bilateral talks on strategic arms  the agreements signed in Moscow are a first step in the right direction; yet these are not measures of nuclear disarmament but efforts to stabilize a precarious military balance between the super-Powers. In other words  they are not enough to stem and turn back the nuclear arms race.37.	In this discouraging picture of the field of nuclear disarmament  new life must be given to the negotiations  and  in order to do so  the competent organ must ensure the participation of all the nuclear Powers  in a manner satisfactory to all the States concerned. So we note with pleasure that  for the first time in its history  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has given this problem special attention and that its report [A/8818] shows a certain degree of flexibility regarding possible alterations in its organization. My delegation has been particularly interested in this important matter and we venture to hope that this will be the starting-point for informal consultations to rectify an anomaly that is prejudicial to the development of the international community.38.	Argentina has supported the idea that this General Assembly should deal with measures to prevent international terrorism that endangers innocent human lives  costs lives or threatens fundamental freedoms. Elsewhere  and at different times  my country has condemned irrational violence and has appealed for reflection in the face of the wave of hatred and destruction that has swept the world of today. This phenomenon constitutes a serious affront to mankind and to our civilization. Therefore  the United Nations must not and cannot remain indifferent to the danger it implies for peaceful coexistence among men.39.	In matters of economic co-operation  the international community will have a new and significant opportunity during the rest of 1972 and particularly in 1973 to make progress in the improvement of relations among States of differing degrees of development  through a more just and effective regulation.40.	The reform of the international monetary system and the planned multilateral trade negotiations are important occasions for those countries that bear the major responsibility to turn their sights beyond their own strictly national interests and allow these new efforts to be fitted into the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.41.	We believe that the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  held in Santiago  Chile  in April and May of this year  constituted a promising point of departure for that international undertaking. During the course of that session the convergence of the policies for co-operation in that field reached new heights.42.	Both at that session of UNCTAD and at other international and regional meetings on economic and financial matters  Argentina has pledged its determined support so that such initiatives will achieve the success that the international community is eagerly seeking.43.	In the fields of science and technology  Argentina is determined to make rapid advances in a dynamic process of modernization through the maximum use of the resources offered by these branches of knowledge in order to secure better standards of living for its population.44.	We are disturbed over the prevalence of certain views in the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] which  ignoring the multiplying effect of the efforts of co-operation made by peoples at different stages of development  are trying to change the present system of distribution of resources  reserving them almost exclusively for extreme cases of optimum development.45.	At the same time as Argentina makes use of UNDP as a helpful instrument to complement its needs in that area  we must stress that we also contribute a considerable number of national experts who service projects in different parts of the world and that we welcome yearly more than a hundred fellowship holders from other countries for training in our country.46.	At the beginning I pointed out the dangers for the medium and small nations of being left on the fringes of a multi-polar system based on the balance of power among the great Powers. We are also disturbed over any attempts to slow down the process of updating the economies of the developing countries by limiting the transfer of science and technology to them.47.	To concede that growth must be stemmed would be tantamount to admitting that there are countries doomed to remain halfway on the road to civilization and would further imply a frustration of man's capacity for permanent creation. As was the case in economic matters  in the fields of culture and the preservation of the environment  here too active international co-operation is imperative.48.	If we wish to achieve international peace and security  which are fundamental objectives of our Charter  then we shall have to make real the aspirations to a better life for which all peoples yearn. There can be no peace without international justice  and there will be no justice until each and every country assumes fully its responsibilities. In 1945 our Organization was born to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Man's survival is still paramount today  but there is a clear awareness that it must rest on the firm foundations of freedom and the dignity of the human person so that he can develop to the utmost his creative potential. These drives  which are the features of our day and our society  must be reflected in the action of the United Nations."
"5",308,"AUS",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like  on behalf of the Australian delegation  to add my congratulations upon your election as President of this General Assembly session. Our two countries are far apart geographically  but our peoples have had some common experiences which have given them  I believe  a respect and understanding of each other. With the exchange this year of diplomatic representatives  the relations between our two countries are entering a period of constructive and fruitful development. In your high office  to which you come with distinction and obvious talent  you may be assured of the full co-operation of the Australian delegation.121.	I wish also to express my warm appreciation of the contribution made by the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  who brought to the office of President great charm and distinction  as well as wise counsel. Australia and Indonesia are close neighbors and we take special pleasure in recalling Mr. Malik's presidency.122.	May I be permitted also to commend the dedication to his task that the Secretary-General has shown in his first year of office. The Australian delegation appreciates his distillation of the essence of his report in a short introduction. In this introduction [A/8701IAdd.l] he has set forth his determination to work actively for peaceful solutions to international problems. Most of what he has said in that brief explanation of his conception of the duties and objectives of the United Nations  and of his own responsibilities  will be accepted without qualification by my Government.123.	Australia has been  not an uncritical  but a strong and consistent supporter of the United Nations. The purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are basic to our foreign policy. This year Australia has decided to stand for election to membership in the Security Council. This is evidence of our willingness to accept our share of the general responsibilities of United Nations membership and of our belief that we can represent in a significant sense the Asian and Pacific region.124.	Throughout our participation in the work of this Organization  Australia has sought to find ways by which the Charter and the United Nations as an institution can be used more effectively for reducing world tensions and for bringing increased harmony and stability into the international system. We do not seek a simply static world order; we seek one which can encompass even rapid change. But we firmly believe that change should take place always in a peaceful and orderly way. Most nations will acknowledge that the United Nations has not yet made sufficient progress in stabilizing international political relations within a generally acceptable code of international rules. Around the world we continue to face the tragic results of attempts to settle disputes and impose political solutions by force and terror and violence.125.	We believe that the functioning of any society of men or nations  if it is to be peaceably and soundly based  must depend upon the effective working of a rule of law that is generally understood  generally accepted and generally respected. It is true to say that the work of the United Nations rests on the twin pillars of international law and justice. There can be no more constructive way of contributing to the strength of the United Nations than to look for opportunities of broadening and deepening its involvement in new areas of common international concern  with the object of widening the scope and  I would hope  the acceptability of a just and realistic code of international behavior.126.	We have before us the question whether the Charter might need some revision. We all have in mind that it was drawn up at the end of the Second World War in circumstances that have since undergone substantial transformation. We can all agree that the Charter falls short of perfection. But as an enduring statement of political concepts and values  it has stood the test of time remarkably well. Its potential for practical implementation that will lead us to a well-ordered world system is still very far from exhausted. 127.	My Government would be prepared to support amendments to specific Articles of the Charter which might now be out of date or in other respects now irrelevant  if there were a substantial measure of agreement on the proposed changes. That might be reason to question  for example  whether the wording of Article 23  paragraph 1  makes it possible to ensure that the original intent of that provision is carried out in full. We are not  however  attracted to the idea of wholesale review. There are too many differences of opinion for such a review to be certainly profitable. We would not favor the convening of a large conference which might result in division and dissension and which might even diminish respect for the present Charter without offering any certain prospect of an acceptable alternative. The damage to the United Nations could well be difficult to repair.128.	The program of work for this session offers us opportunities to help the United Nations to establish a world system in which agreed international laws and practices will prevail. Not all of these are equally mature for treatment by this General Assembly  but each offers some scope for removing inequalities and harmonizing relations between States.129.	The maintenance of international peace and security must remain the basic purpose of the United Nations. Australia  for its part  continues to be actively involved in United Nations peace-keeping functions  both in the field and here at Headquarters. As a member of the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations  we regret the failure of the Committee to make any substantial progress in recent years and its virtual stagnation during 1972. It is an unhappy commentary on the state of multilateral diplomacy within our Organization that the impasse reached on matters of substance is such that Members can conceive and develop no initiative which may offer a possible breakthrough and enable the Committee to carry out its mandate.130.	So long as we are unable to keep the peace  Governments will feel they need to go armed in a potentially hostile world. The crushing burden and the gruesome threat of modern armories are thus a symptom of our failure to create the well-ordered world system which remains the basic purpose of the United Nations. This in the final analysis must await agreement on effective measures of arms limitation and control. In respect of the items on this year's agenda  Australia will continue to support any genuinely constructive measures that promise to contribute to the climate of world peace.131.	In this spirit  the Australian Government welcomes the fact that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have advanced to agreement  if not yet to finality. We welcome the entry into force of the treaty on arms control on the sea-bed. Australia was also able to sign on 10 April last  the day on which it was opened for signature  the Convention to ban biological weapons of war.  We would also certainly support the convening  at the appropriate time and after full and careful preparation  of a world disarmament conference that could bring together all nations  and particularly all those more powerful nations whose consensus will be imperative in the words of the Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.132.	Australia would particularly like to see the negotiation of a comprehensive treaty  with effective provisions for verification and control  to prohibit the conduct of nuclear weapons testing in all environments by all States. The first step towards that objective should be  in our view  the universal acceptance and application of the existing Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. But we still do not have universal acceptance of this treaty  and there is still no halt to nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere.133.	Those peoples  including my own  that live in and around the Pacific Ocean have made clear their strong opposition to these tests. Australia and New Zealand have taken a joint initiative in calling together a meeting of nations bordering on the Pacific Ocean that have raised their voices against nuclear weapons testing for the purpose of discussing this matter. Our first meeting proved constructive and useful. We hope  as a result  that we shall  with a substantial body of sponsors  be able to bring forward a meaningful resolution at an appropriate time during the current session.134.	I move now from nuclear terror to plain human terror. In saying this I am  of course  aware that a debate has already taken place here on the question whether or not this Assembly should embark upon a discussion of terrorism and how to put an end to it.135.	My Government welcomed the initiative of the Secretary-General in seeking the inclusion in the agenda of an item designed to give us an opportunity to discuss terrorism [A/8791 and Add.lJ. This item has been included [item 92]. It is for all of us now to seek practical and effective ways of containing terrorism. The Secretary- General has rightly stressed the humanitarian aspects of the problem  and particularly its impact on innocent bystanders and non-participants.136.	I want to make it clear that I do not have in mind any one particular terrorist act. My Government understands fully the kinds of frustration  grievance and despair that can lead particular groups and individuals to embark on desperate enterprises designed to hold persons  often innocent persons  or even Governments to ransom. But there are two things that must be said about the growing incidence of this world-wide pattern of intimidation by terrorism  whether it takes the form of the abduction or killing of diplomats or private individuals  or the hijacking of aircraft  or political assassination. The first is that however deplorable it is that disputes between groups or countries should escalate to the point of violence and terrorism  it becomes intolerable when the side effects of these disputes begin to appear in the harassment of Governments and the endangering of the lives of innocent people in countries that are not involved  and have no reason to be involved  in those disputes. The second point I want to make is that terror creates terror  that terrorism does not solve problems but breeds more terrorism within and among nations. If terrorism is allowed to go unchecked it must lead ultimately towards anarchy  national as well as international. It is  therefore  a matter of concern to every Member of the United Nations. The reputation of the United Nations as a whole will be gravely affected if the Organization is seen to shrink from facing the problem.137.	The Australian Government  in consultation with other Governments  has been examining possible ways of countering terrorist violence against innocent parties. We hope that the Assembly will treat this as a matter of urgency and reach early agreement on measures that may take us at least part of the way towards the solution of a problem which we recognize is full of difficulty for many Member countries  but which nevertheless demands immediate action. Looking further ahead  my delegation has had in mind the possibility of an international convention aimed at outlawing acts of violence and intimidation which arise essentially from local conflicts but which are in effect directed primarily at innocent people and uninvolved Governments. The problem is full of complexity  and there is more than one way of tackling it. The United States Secretary of State has put before us a draft convention on the subject [A/C.6/L.850]  which we shall all of us wish to study with great care. Another possible suggestion that my Government has had in mind is that the International Law Commission might be asked to draft the provisions of such a convention. But these proposals are for the longer term  and are no substitute for the urgent action that is demanded by public and private opinion everywhere for effective preventive measures to defeat the indiscriminate threat of terrorism.138.	The threat is universal. It has reached us in Australia in forms no less grave than elsewhere. A bomb that exploded two weeks ago in a main street of our biggest city  at the entrance of an agency of a European Government  left 16 innocent people injured  some of them critically. Only two days ago some half-dozen of the so-called letter bombs were discovered in the central post office in Canberra. I mention both these incidents only to show how the manifestations of terrorism germinated from local grievances in any quarter of the world can threaten innocent people in countries many thousands of miles away.139.	My Government regards all acts of that kind as utterly abhorrent to our way of life. When acts of terrorism occur in Australia  we are determined to use all our resources to apprehend and prosecute the offenders. We are equally determined that  so far as it lies within our power  we will prevent our country from being used at any time as a base for terrorist acts in any other country. We join other nations in condemning not only acts of terrorism  but also those acts of violent retaliation  understandable as they may be  which in themselves carry the seeds of escalation into further terrorism.140.	The increasing incidence of aircraft hijacking and other kinds of criminal interference with air travel constitutes only one manifestation of the insidious effects of terror by example. More often than not its effects reach beyond the limits of jurisdiction of any single country. This means that it can be contained and ultimately eradicated only by a stringent combination of domestic and internationally agreed penalties. A beginning has been made in the form of the conclusion of three Conventions to deal with this problem  all three of which my Government has either ratified or is in the process of ratifying. But there is obviously more to be done before innocent travelers in every country in the world can feel sure that they can take to the air without the risk of placing their lives at the mercy of human terror.141.	I think we all recognize that a well-ordered system of international behavior depends not only on dedication to accepted and established principles but also on the measure of detailed agreement we can reach on the many practical matters that affect the daily transactions of peoples and governments everywhere.142.	One of these practical matters concerns the seas and the resources that lie in and underneath them. The United Nations is now preparing for a conference on the law of the sea. This conference could be one of the most important of this decade. The Australian Government  as a member of the committee responsible for preparing this conference  is pleased at the progress the committee has made.143.	We welcome the growing acceptance in that committee of the view that the new law of the sea should accord greater recognition than is at present given by international law to the interests of coastal States in the resources  the quality of the environment  and the conduct of scientific research in the seas and sea-bed adjacent to them but beyond their territorial waters. If this is reflected in the final convention  it should be possible to confine the Territorial sea to a breadth of 12 miles and to devise a satisfactory regime for passage through straits used for international navigation. This would be a progressive development of the law  in the best sense.144.	We have spoken of our desire for a peaceful and well-ordered world. We also want a world in which the preservation of a healthy environment goes hand in hand with material progress. Australia recognizes the need for international conventions in this field  most immediately in the field of control over marine pollution. We look forward to further progress as a result of the Conference on Marine Pollution to be organized by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization in 1973  and from the continuing valuable studies of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.145.	The most significant achievement so far in our efforts to preserve the global environment has  of course  been the encouraging outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm. Australia will support the adoption by the General Assembly of the Conference's reports and the recommendations contained therein. At the same time we remain conscious of the fears among developing countries that the preservation of the environment might come to assume priority within the United Nations over the continuing need for assistance for .economic development. And we respect this concern. We consider that protection of the environment and economic development must go hand in hand  and must not be regarded as mutually exclusive or competitive.146.	Australia supports the proposal to establish a governing council for environmental programs.  I believe that Australia can make a valuable contribution to the work of this Council. We will seek election to that body at this session of the Assembly and we have already announced a pledge of $2.5 million to the voluntary Environment Fund.147.	I have so far be ^n dealing with matters which directly affect us all. I should now like to bring to the Assembly some of the significant developments affecting international relations in the Asian and Pacific region.148.	One of the most exciting developments in our own area is the rapid movement towards self-government and independence of Papua New Guinea. The third Papua New Guinea House of Assembly was elected in March of this year and has now voted in favor of Papua New Guinea becoming fully self-governing on 1 December 1973 or as soon as possible thereafter. Independence will follow when the House of Assembly decides the time is right. The transition to independence by a people is an inspiring and important achievement  and I hope that the close and friendly relationship that continues between Australia and Papua New Guinea will provide convincing evidence of success in our efforts in helping to bring that country to the point of self-determination.149.	It is a short step from Papua New Guinea to the islands of the South Pacific ocean  and just before coming to New York I attended in Suva the third meeting of the South Pacific Forum  in which Government leaders of independent countries in the region now meet regularly to review common problems. It was agreed at the Suva meeting that countries like Papua New Guinea which were on the threshold of self-government or independence and wished to become members of the Forum could participate as observers until such time as they became self-governing or independent. Papua New Guinea will consequently be able to attend the next meeting of the South Pacific Forum as an observer.150.	This Forum  offering  as it does  an opportunity for frank discussion and consultation on the widest range of common problems  has already become a significant and influential regional body. The Pacific countries are actively seeking understanding and co-operation through consultation. Their efforts are a conspicuous example of the effective application of the principles of the United Nations Charter. As an indication of Australia's interest in assisting the countries of the South Pacific we have increased our development aid to the region to the figure of $A 15 million over the next three years.151.	I have devoted some little time to Australia's relations with the island communities to our east  across the South Pacific  mainly because all those communities are now beginning to establish their own individual identity. This does not  of course  mean that there has been any diminution in the constant attention we in Australia give to our relations with our neighbor countries to our north to the countries of South-East and East Asia. These relationships continue to prosper in the same frank and cordial atmosphere that has prevailed since they achieved independence. Our bilateral relations with each of them are good. We enjoy very satisfactory multilateral associations with a number of them; and they are establishing closer links among and between themselves through organizations such as ASEAN—the Association of South-East Asian Nations which promises to contribute substantially to the peace and stability of the region.152.	The exception to peace in South-East Asia is Indochina  where the merciless and needless destruction and suffering caused by the now undisguised aggression of North Viet-Nam continue to appall the world. We can only appeal to the leaders in the North to take stock of the terrible havoc this war has wrought. Realization is long overdue that serious negotiation does not signify weakness  that a negotiated settlement does not signify defeat and that it is not impossible for different ideologies eventually to coexist in peace and prosperity.153.	My Government fully supports the terms of the offer made by the President of the United States in May of this year as a practical basis for ending the military conflict  and we can only hope that that offer  or one like it  will ultimately prove to hold the key to real progress not only towards a cease-fire but also towards an agreed settlement that will bring an end to the miseries of the long-suffering people of South Viet-Nam and also of their neighbors in Laos and the Khmer Republic.154.	Australia had hoped that at this session of the General Assembly we should be able to welcome to the Organization as a new Member Bangladesh  with which Australia has especially friendly links. We believe that Bangladesh is fully qualified for membership in the United Nations. We remain hopeful that the Security Council  upon reconsideration of the matter  will recommend in favor of the Bangladesh application and that as a result the Assembly will still be able at its present session to admit this new State to the world body as a full Member.155.	In passing  may I compliment the Secretary-General on the impressive way in which his office has tackled the enormous problem of co-ordinating relief for Bangladesh. Independent reports from Dacca testify to the expedition and efficiency with which relief aid valued at more than $200 million has been made available to Bangladesh by the United Nations Relief Operation in Dacca since the end of last year.156.	The economic problems facing Bangladesh exemplify the need for greater assistance on more favorable terms to the developing world. Australia this year is committed to provide $US 260 million in international aid  an increase of 10 per cent over expenditure in the previous financial year. Together with private capital flows  the net transfer of resources to developing countries this year will account for an estimated 1.27 per cent of Australia's gross national product. Australia continues to be among the first three or four donor countries in the amount of official development assistance extended in relation to gross national product  and almost all Australian aid is given in the form of grants. Among other increases  Australia will be raising its contribution to the United Nations Development Program this year by 20 per cent.157.	Before concluding  I should refer briefly to the financial position of the United Nations. We believe it remains a vital task for each of us to assist in finding a solution to the Organization's debt problem. We hope that real progress will be made when the question is taken up this year in the Fifth Committee.158.	We welcome the steps taken by the Secretary-General to restrain budgetary increases. Australia wants to see each year a budget adequate to support the expanding work- program of the Organization. But that does not mean that every new program or project  however well intentioned  is to be accepted regardless of its cost. The United Nations  like other institutions  has to establish its priorities in the knowledge that not every fresh activity can be accommodated in the budget at one and the same time.159. I have spoken about the role of the United Nations in maintaining a stable  harmonious world order  and about particular situations within and outside the immediate purview of the United Nations which closely affect my country. In all these situations there is a challenge to the United Nations  which means a challenge to all of us here. Let us hope we can accept that challenge."
"6",355,"AUT",27,1972,"Mr. President  I take the greatest pleasure in expressing to you the heartfelt congratulations of the Austrian delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We greet you as a personality of the highest professional and human qualifications and we also greet you as the representative of a country with which Austria maintains close ties through a policy of friendly understanding and an auspiciously developing co-operation. We are convinced that under your guidance this General Assembly will be successful in its work.45.	I also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Adam Malik  President of last year's General Assembly  for the prudence and the skill with which he directed it.46.	The twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly has witnessed the termination of more than a decade of self-sacrificing endeavor on the part of a man whose term of office has coincided not only with one of the most active periods in world politics  but also with one of the most difficult phases in the history of the United Nations. The place U Thant has taken among the tireless protagonists in the cause of world peace is lasting and unshakable and we shall always be grateful to him. The Austrian delegation deems it particularly appropriate to pay a tribute to this historic achievement  as our delegation today has the special privilege-in full respect of Article 100 of the United Nations Charter to say how proud and happy Austria is to see an Austrian  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  holding the responsible post of Secretary-General of the United Nations.47.	Mr. Secretary-General  we offer you our greetings and wish you most sincerely every success in the service of the high ideals of the United Nations. We know your outstanding qualities and your dedication to the task entrusted to you. Accordingly  we look forward with confidence to your activities in your high office. The first nine months of your tenure entitle us fully to this expectation.48.	More than 100 ministers of foreign affairs  other members of Government  and even prime ministers have gathered in New York for this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This affords great opportunities for personal contacts. They are of great value. But personal contacts alone are not enough. The peoples of the world expect more. They expect us to come closer to the goal of peace and security in justice.49.	The Charter and several basic declarations of the General Assembly have defined the purposes and principles which should govern the life of the community of nations. Rather than only discussing them  we should apply them and apply them in good faith. The scientists of our generation have gained access to the universe. Why then should we  who carry political responsibility  and why should sociologists and humanists lag so far behind their counterparts in the exact sciences in their efforts to achieve peace and security in justice?50.	We are painfully aware of centers of crisis throughout the world and also of the danger they represent for peace in every other part of the world. Yet it seems to me that we can assess political developments since the last session of the General Assembly with some guarded optimism.51.	The President of the United States of America has visited China and the Soviet Union during the first half of this year. This highlighted the efforts by the three greatest Powers of the world to place their relationships on a new footing of trust and co-operation.52.	At the beginning of this week an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States of America limiting their strategic weapons  has entered into force  and the two Governments have expressed their willingness to continue their efforts in this field.53.	In Europe we are witnessing a process aimed at detente and co-operation. The status of permanent neutrality has enabled Austria to make its contribution to this process as one of the first countries  more than a decade ago.54.	This year  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the ratification of the treaties concluded in 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and the Soviet Union and Poland on the other gave a strong impetus to a reduction of tensions in Europe. We sincerely hoDe that the necessary prerequisites will be soon brought about to enable both German States to become Members of our world Organization.55.	The first preparatory phase for a conference on European security and co-operation now lies before us. Security presupposes a credible renunciation of force and the threat of force  credible for all States  large  medium- sized and small. It will therefore be the task of the conference to provide the appropriate basis for security in Europe.56.	A step in this direction could be a treaty which would codify  in a legally binding and politically feasible way  the duties and rights of States and would set up machinery to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes. Negotiations on a balanced reduction of military forces in Europe could become a good test of the effectiveness of detente actually achieved.57.	Comprehensive co-operation in Europe in the economic  cultural  scientific and technological fields and also in the field of human environment is of great significance for progress in these areas. It is of equally great significance for a better understanding between men. Co-operation thus promotes the relaxation of tensions and strengthens security.58.	In pursuing these thoughts  I fully realize that the solution of the problems existing in Europe would not by itself eliminate tension  warfare and injustice in other parts of the world. It may  however  be justified to assume that a solution of European problems in the spirit of the Charter would not fail to have its impact on other continents too. The whole world has suffered in the course of this century from the consequences of two wars which spread from Europe. Why  then  should the whole world not benefit from the consequences of a peaceful development in Europe? Thus  the Austrian Government  in contributing to the strengthening of security and co-operation in Europe  does so in the firm hope that such action will also serve to promote peaceful development in other parts of the world.59.	Austria is a permanently neutral country. The concept of neutrality originates in the law of war. This  however  should not lead to the idea that a permanently neutral State needs the setting of war or international tension to play a part in the community of nations. On the contrary  my Government interprets neutrality as a means of preserving Austria's independence and  at the same time  as a stabilizing and peace-keeping element within the international community. What Austria can give to the world are works and values which can grow only in an atmosphere of peace. The objective of Austrian policy is the enhancement of the well-being of the individual. Humanitarian tasks form an integral part of the primary duties of a neutral State.60.	Recent years have shown a strong trend towards acts of violence perpetrated at both the national and the international level. Terrorism has become a social and an international problem. We must be able to assess this development clearly. If acts of terror continue to increase in the future at the same rate as they did in the last years  then  a few years from now  we shall be faced with a situation which may not be called war in the proper sense of the term but which will none the less inflict all the scourges of war upon innocent people  the very scourges of war which the United Nations wanted to rule out forever.61.	In view of the very objectives and principles of its Charter  the United Nations will have to take a stand against terror. The time for such action is already late. The Federal Government of Austria has condemned and will continue to condemn terrorism. Austria itself has taken and will take all measures necessary to suppress and to eliminate terrorism. Moreover  Austria will support all measures serving this purpose on the international level. Hijacking  the taking of hostages and murder cannot be accepted as means of resolving social or international problems if the dignity of man as enshrined in the Charter is to be taken seriously.62.	The existence of terrorism should not  however  serve as an excuse to abstain from an earnest consideration of the social and international phenomena underlying such acts. Should v/e fail in our efforts to provide and make effective the peaceful means needed for the implementation of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter and in the declarations and resolutions of the United Nations  our condemnation of terror will be devoid of success and even devoid of sincerity. The serious nature of the problem and the multitude of facets it involves can hardly be underestimated. The dignity of our world Organization would be best served if the treatment of the problem were to lead to a concerted search for a common goal  rather than to mutual charges and counter-charges.63.	I said at the beginning that people throughout the world expect from us  who have gathered here  peace and security in justice. Peace and security alone may well satisfy a few of the ""haves""-but not  at least  the ""have-nots"". They will also demand justice.64.	The demand for justice confronts us in a variety of contexts. In particular  I am thinking of the elimination of discrimination based on race  religion or other grounds  and  especially  the termination of the policy of apartheid. In this context  I wish to refer to the position taken by the Austrian delegation at all previous sessions of the General Assembly. My Government also welcomes the decisions adopted by the Security Council at its meetings held in Addis Ababa  particularly with reference to Namibia.65.	The demand for justice also centers on the solution of the economic and social problems in the developing countries. We all know  and my Government knows  that more has to be done both in respect of the substance and of the methods to be pursued. In the coming year Austria will greatly increase its official development assistance.66.	In this connexion  I should like to refer to the following considerations submitted by Austria at the annual meetings of the Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  held jointly with that of the International Monetary Fund  which took place in Washington from 25 to 29 September 1972.67.	A number of important international capital movements between the industrialized nations of Western Europe and North America have resulted in the accumulation of considerable amounts of United States dollars outside the United States. Careful consideration should be given to the possibility of using part of this ""overhang"" of United States dollars for low-cost development financing.68.	My Government is considering the purchase of United States dollars from the Austrian National Bank  our central bank  in order to offer these dollars as loans to international organizations which are concerned with development financing  such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. These loans would be made available at interest rates attractive to developing countries.69.	In my contribution to the general debate I have focused attention on only a few subjects. Other questions of equal importance have had to be left untouched  such as  for example  the question of disarmament  an area where Austria is ready to off"" constructive co-operation; and the question of the protection of the environment  which is basic to human life in the future. I also have not mentioned the crisis in the Middle East. Austria's position in this matter is well known and was extensively explained both from this rostrum and during official visits to Israel and Egypt. Austria believes in the continued usefulness of the Jarring mission.70.	For 10 years now  at every session of the General Assembly  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria has reported on the question of South Tyrol  which was the subject-matter of resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) by which Austria and Italy were urged to find a solution for all differences through negotiation. Two years ago I could report to the General Assembly that after nine years of effort the two States had agreed on a proposal for a solution which contained provisions for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol and a relevant time-table agreed to by both States [see 1855th meeting  paras. 169-174].71.	I am happy to be able to state that the implementation of the proposal for a settlement of this question has made further progress since the last session of the General Assembly. Thus  the constitutional law on the extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol came into effect on 20 January 1972. In April of this year  a large part of the ordinary laws provided for in addition to the constitutional law also entered into effect; a certain part is still pending.72.	I wish to express the hope that the development now in progress will continue to advance further in a satisfactory way on the basis of the implementation  in letter and in spirit  of the still-outstanding measures in South Tyrol  and of an understanding attitude on the part of the Italian Government towards the needs of the South Tyrolean ethnic group  which  in turn  will lead to an even better relationship between the two neighboring countries.73.	Permit me to go back to the beginning of my statement. I said that the establishment of peace and security based on justice is the aim the peoples of the world expect us to achieve. This expectation coincides with the aims and purposes of the United Nations. The United Nations is not just an organization in New York  far from our home countries. We ourselves are the United Nations  first as Member States  but also as human beings for whose sake this Organization was created  as individuals-members of nations  of religious denominations  of political parties  of majorities and minorities  of the affluent and of the needy. We must strive to make peace and security based on justice a reality in each and every one of these  our capacities. We should not be judges one over the other  one State over another State. To this we have no right  but we do have the duty to unite our energies to achieve peace and security injustice."
"7",426,"BDI",27,1972,"A country jealous of its independence and sovereignty  achieved at the cost of the blood of the flower of its youth; a nation living in symbiosis for thousands of years  proud of its liberation and cohesiveness in spite of the nefarious actions of those who have imported barbaric systems repugnant to the conscience of mankind; a determined people fighting at the side of other revolutionary peoples in a relentless struggle against under-development and injustice in all its forms; a people that has always fought to bring about the triumph of the noble ideals of the Charter; an authority based on democratic centralism capable of ensuring the security of both nationals and foreigners; a people united and engaged in an irreversible revolution which began on 28 November 1966 thanks to its wise guide and well-loved chief  Colonel Michel Micombero this is today the glory and honor of the Republic of Burundi and the pride of its inhabitants.2.	It is on behalf of that Republic that from this lofty rostrum I have the honor of conveying to the President my warmest congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. He may be assured that my delegation will be at his side and support him in his noble and lofty task of serving faithfully and indefatigably the interests of the whole international community. We are certain that the objectives of our Organization will ultimately be achieved  thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the various world personalities who devote body and soul to this task. The President is one of those  and it is precisely for this reason that he has been elected to preside over the General Assembly. His eminent political attributes and diplomatic qualities  his expertise in international questions  and his personality which transcends the limits of his own country a personality which has long since made its mark on the international scene-his experience  competence and integrity constitute  we are sure  an earnest of the success of this Assembly session. As citizen of a country Poland which has suffered from foreign aggression  we are sure that he will be all the more concerned about the problems of aggression against the independent countries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and elsewhere.3.	At this particular stage in history  when certain Powers are doing everything they can to sow subversion in the less-favored countries  fomenting division among citizens of the same country and also promoting foreign aggression  it is a great pleasure for us to have such an eminent personality as he presiding over this session  backed up by the members of the General Committee  who together make up such a great team. It is for this reason that we are confident that this Assembly session will be crowned with success  and that we greet him with such enthusiasm.4.	May I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  who throughout last year ceaselessly strove for world peace and international security.5.	I should also like to thank and congratulate most sincerely Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of the United Nations  whose competence  devotion and probity are a credit to the Organization. Since his election to his high office a year ago Mr. Waldheim has devoted all his energies to the safeguarding of peace and to the search for understanding among peoples. Let him find in this the sincere expression of well deserved gratitude on the part of the Government of the Republic of Burundi.6.	On 26 June 1945  many of the nations represented here today signed the Charter of the United Nations at San Francisco. Our country was not yet independent  but it was no less appreciative of the principles contained in that Charter. That is why  on 18 September 1962  precisely 79 days after its liberation  the Burundi people wholeheartedly adhered to the United Nations. In that way my Government and country demonstrated their determination to struggle for the safeguarding and success of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.7.	Burundi  in joining this Organization  was thereby taking an oath that it would henceforth spare no effort to maintain international peace and security and to promote development among nations and friendly relations based on the principle of the equal rights of peoples and their right to guide their own destinies and to take all other measures which might consolidate world peace and bring about international co-operation through the solution of international problems in the economic  social  technical and humanitarian fields.8.	It behooves us to note that today  10 years after becoming a Member of the United Nations  Burundi has always acted consistently with the principles to which it solemnly subscribed.9.	All nations represented here may derive gratification from the climate of understanding which has made it possible to avoid new conflicts among States. The world today may take pleasure at the fruitful talks which have been held between the People's Republic of China and the United States  on the one hand  and the United States and the Soviet Union on the other hand. The visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to China  the talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea bode well for the unity of divided nations and for peace in Asia. This climate of detente  so favorable to the search for peace and co-operation  is a direct consequence of the admission last year of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.10.	The friendly meetings and dialog between the leaders of nations and the world are  we are certain  a guarantee of international peace and security  as well as of the unity of the great human family. It is therefore to be hoped that such meetings will take place regularly and periodically. Although our Organization has registered striking successes  we must express our regret at the fact that the worst hotbeds of conflict which constitute a permanent threat to international peace and security still persist and threaten to grow even worse. I would mention particularly the Far East and the Middle East conflicts  and the situation in the Territories under apartheid or the anachronistic colonialism of Portugal.11.	Once again the Republic of Burundi appeals most urgently to international opinion  particularly to those responsible for the tragedy which has been going on in Viet-Nam for almost 30 years now  to see to it that those deliberate and organized massacres committed against an innocent people cease immediately. These massacres have been repeatedly denounced by many representatives from all continents.12.	I  in turn  associate myself with them in asking that the 1954 Geneva Agreements be scrupulously observed and that the foreign troops of aggression be totally withdrawn from Vietnamese territory to enable the people of Viet-Nam itself  as a free nation  to settle its own affairs. For its part  the Republic of Burundi considers this to be the only acceptable solution dictated by common sense  because this war benefits neither the aggressor nor the Vietnamese people  but constitutes a crime against humanity and an unprecedented waste. This state of affairs  moreover  seriously jeopardizes the prestige of our Organization  and prevents it from effectively fulfilling its original and ultimate mission of protecting future generations from the scourge of war. My country suggests that France  which has offered its hospitality to the negotiators on Viet-Nam  could play an even more active role as mediator  thus responding to the statement of its Foreign Minister  Mr. Maurice Schumann  who said  just a few days ago thatFrance ""... has allies but neither has nor wants enemies."" [2041st meeting  para. 62. ].13.	Not far from Viet-Nam is another suffering people- the people of Korea. As long as that country  which wants to be an entity following its reunification  continues to be the object of a power and influence struggle  peace in that region will be delayed. That is why the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland must be brought about rapidly. For our part  we consider that no State in the world has the right to stand in the way of this manifest will of the Korean people. While the delegation of Burundi takes pleasure in noting the fact that talks between the two Koreas are under way  it regrets none the less that the United Nations has not hastened the conclusion of those negotiations  in spite of the consultation asked for by the two parties.14.	A no less disturbing problem is that of Bangladesh  whose fate depends largely on friendship among all the States in the area and normalization of their relations. We hope that speedy achievement of the conditions governing admission to the United Nations-which has so far been lacking may take place soon.15.	Within the same context  our delegation expresses its pleasure at the contacts between the two Germanys. This constitutes a prelude to the strengthening of European security which  we hope  will consolidate international peace and security and the well-being of the people of Germany as a whole.16.	I come now to the Middle East conflict which has become a real tragedy for mankind. The Government of Burundi considers that immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would be conducive to the restoration of peace in that part of the world. Withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Arab territories  together with settlement of the Palestinian problem  would reduce the causes of tension in that part of the world and  consequently  the frequency of individual or collective acts of violence caused by that war.17.	As a member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] we object to any part of the territory of an African country  in this instance the Arab Republic of Egypt  being occupied by armed force. The reopening of the Suez Canal has become an imperative necessity for many African countries whose goods are subject to high transport costs.18.	We invite the two super-Powers to do their utmost to bring about a rapid settlement of the Middle East crisis which is liable to provoke a thermonuclear war at the very time when disarmament is the topic of the day.19.	On the question of disarmament  my delegation would like to make some suggestions. In spite of the signing of many agreements on the reduction of armaments  the misuse of which may well lead to a terrible catastrophe  the danger of a war threatening to wipe out mankind is far from negligible.20.	That is why the Burundi Government welcomes the courageous proposal to convene a world disarmament conference. My Government considers that such a conference is of the greatest concern to mankind as a whole which is earnestly hoping for the day when the present astronomical expenditure on weapons of destruction will be channeled towards its prosperity and happiness. In order to attain this objective fully  the conference should be held at the level of Heads of State or Heads of Government  who would take decisions to bring about total and complete disarmament.21.	We come now to problems relating to decolonization in Africa. While the African continent is dangerously threatened in the north by the Middle East conflict  other hotbeds of unrest and conflict are deliberately and cruelly maintained in the south  thus rendering peace precarious and very seriously jeopardizing its development.22.	I associate the delegation of the Republic of Burundi with the representatives who have spoken before me from this rostrum  to condemn South Africa's hold on the Territory of  Namibia and also the terrible physical and moral exhaustion which it is causing to the black peoples of South Africa. 		23.	The results of the mission undertaken by the Secretary-General in the first half of this year as well as all the contacts and subsequent representations are impatiently awaited. Without prejudging the content of that report  we should like now to express the hope that it will provide for broad consultation with the people of Namibia. The integrity and independence of the Territory of Namibia should be safeguarded. The so-called autonomy which South Africa wishes to give separately to the different tribes instead of liberating the country as a whole  is an old colonialist maneuver designed to divide in order the better to perpetuate domination. My delegation would like to express wishes for success to the Secretary-General in this enterprise for which a Special Representative has been specifically nominated  and he should  we hope  hasten the issuing of the report so that the Organization does not have to prolong indefinitely its analysis of the case of Namibia.24.	We again urge Great Britain to do everything in its power  if necessary by force  to put an end to the rebel regime of Salisbury and to grant independence to the people of Zimbabwe struggling for its self-determination. The United Kingdom should also show its good faith in that unhappy affair instead of taking refuge behind legal subterfuges which deceive no one. The economic embargo against that country called for by the United Nations is a powerful weapon  even if it is not decisive  and it is a weapon which the British authorities could use to bring the Southern Rhodesian regime to see reason.25.	The Members of the United Nations which violate Security Council resolution 253 (1968) on sanctions are deliberately destroying United Nations institutions. An urgent examination of this question is necessary in order to adopt new working methods.26.	The problems of Rhodesia  and those of South Africa  are an exact image of the problem posed by the perpetuation of Portuguese colonialism in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Officially  Portugal considers those African Territories as its own provinces and thus  in the view of Portugal  form an integral part of that shabby  decadent empire which is an empire in name only. Portugal persists in remaining beyond the pale of history by perpetuating its domination in Africa. Notwithstanding the repeated appeals of the world Organization to bring an end to those colonial practices Portugal  in spite of the severe defeats inflicted upon it by the peoples suffering from colonial occupation  still clings  thanks to the aid of certain Powers  to the major cities which alone remain outside the control of the freedom fighters. We think for our part that without the support or the complicity of certain Powers aid with its long tradition of political incoherence Portugal alone would be incapable of resisting the fierce  resolute struggle of the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and Guinea (Bissau). It is therefore incumbent upon our Organization to do its utmost to discourage those Members which  from near or far  support the bloody venture of the Portuguese colonialists. Basing itself on Article 6 of the United Nations Charter  the delegation of the Republic of Burundi has requested at previous sessions that Portugal be expelled from the Organization for having been guilty of grave crimes against peace and mankind as a whole. Since Portugal has done nothing to change its conduct and in fact is continuing to commit the most atrocious crimes  my delegation reiterates this demand for reasons which I have just mentioned and which are well known to all representatives here.27.	These Portuguese crimes are all the more reprehensible and worthy of condemnation because they often extend to independent States. No doubt you all have fresh in your memories the recent and barbaric aggression of Portugal against the people of Guinea which  thanks to their vigilance  were able to neutralize  repel and destroy the enemy. The Assembly is not unaware of the repeated attacks against the Republic of Senegal  the People's Republic of the Congo  the Republic of Zambia  the Republic of Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania.28.	The objective of neocolonialism is quite clear: to recolonize Africa and to continue exploiting its riches. For this purpose the neo-colonialists must place in authority their own men  their faithful servants. It is in this way that neocolonialism takes a particular dislike to the progressive regimes which want to be genuinely independent.29.	Nor does it hesitate if necessary to use organizations and even reactionary Governments in their sinister plan of recolonization. This is particularly the context in which tribal elements supported by foreign mercenaries  encouraged by neo-colonialists  have committed aggression against our own country.30.	More than five months after the failure of the attempt at genocide organized against the people of Burundi  our Government had to depart from the course it had so rigorously observed up to then  that of confining the causes and consequences of the events of last May to the African framework.31.	Thus  thanks to our unswerving attachment to the OAU  we wanted to depict at the highest authority of that organization in Rabat last June the causes and effects of the storm which was unleashed over Burundi.32.	Heeding the appeals for African nobility  dignity and solidarity  we refrained from exposing certain direct or indirect authors of the aggression against our people. Complying with the virtues of discreet consultation within Africa  we banked on the confession and repentance of those who from their own territories had sent elements instructed to participate in massacres of our people. This policy was respected to the letter  both in Bujumbura and by all our embassies abroad. Up to 5 October last  last Thursday in fact  the same silence we had preserved concerning the grievous guilt of one African country in the attempt to commit genocide in Burundi was going to be characteristic of our whole conduct throughout this session.33.	But  alas  since 5 October 1972 Rwanda has abused our full conformity and attachment to the ideals and approaches commended by the OAU. Confusing our recourse to calm dialog with weakness  Mr. Munyaneza  the Foreign Minister of Rwanda  departing from all norms of African wisdom  believed himself to be charged with the task of hurling thunderbolts of condemnation against Burundi. Without doubt trusting to the ingeniousness of his own imagination  the spokesman for the Kigali Government counted on the same spirit of accommodation it had so long benefited from thanks to our great circumspection and our restraint  a gesture which is unique and peculiar to Rwanda  and  after having vilified the Republic of Burundi from this very rostrum its representatives hastened  through certain intermediaries  to commend to us moderation and indeed silence  and this in the interests of the OAU and with the purpose of avoiding hostility on the subject of problems which should be resolved within the context of our own continent. Now  it is precisely in order to safeguard the prestige of our continental organization that all our authorities within the country as well as those outside it have received orders to allow nothing to filter through about the criminal role played by Rwanda in the decimation of our people.34.	Thus arises the inevitable question of why the delegation of Rwanda  under the leadership of Mr. Munyaneza  and certain emissaries remembered the need to keep intact the image of the OAU after having themselves tarnished it by their particularly slanderous allegations against a member State of that organization.35.	This provocative act on the part of the Foreign Minister of Rwanda has made it possible for us finally to shed all possible light on the part played by the Kigali Government in the succession of attempts at coups d'etat and acts of genocide against our people. In the course of the very day in which Mr. Munyaneza was reciting his charges against Burundi  our delegation was obliged to exercise the right of reply [2055th meeting]. Our statement addressed to Rwanda was not confined to a simple routine denial; it was based upon facts and overwhelming evidence against Rwanda  which  although it was the guilty party  actually dared to become an accuser. The massacres.  which in his speech on 5 October  the Minister of National Co-operation laid to what he was pleased to describe as a feudal minority were imputable to the tribalist regime which it incarnates and which he represents.36.	From the Government to the party  including the National Assembly  all the political institutions of Rwanda are tribalized and come from fratricidal procedures  as is shown by the most varied authorized sources  and I would venture to mention these. A report submitted to the sixteenth session of the General Assembly by the United Nations mission to Ruanda-Urundi says:""In Rwanda  on the other hand  a Government has been brought to power which had from the outset followed violent methods and which had been actively supported from its foundation by the Administering Authority .. ."".iIt was also stated that the racial dictatorship of a single party had been established in Rwanda and the events of the ' previous 18 months had consisted in a transition from one kind of oppressive regime to another. That extension was encouraged  and it was to be feared that the Tutsi would find themselves incapable of defending themselves against abuses. It was to be feared that the Tutsi would think they had nothing more to lose and that their only hope of defense lay in recourse to violence  because any possibility of a solution of conciliation had disappeared once and for all. The problem of the Africanization of official jobs had become much more complicated because of the elimination of the Tutsi.37.	I should like to mention another source  a trustworthy source  to substantiate what has happened in that country  which certainly has no right to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. I would venture to quote Radio Vatican  which described the last wave of genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1964 as one of the most terrible and most systematic acts of genocide since the genocide of the Jews by Hitler.38.	There are still other sources. The tribalist inflation in Rwanda was condemned by Rene Lemarchand in his book Rwanda and Burundi   in which he exposes the bloody revolution of Rwanda  stating that that of Burundi was accompanied by no bloodshed when the monarchy was overthrown in 1966. Romain Foucher  in the magazine Esprit of July-August 1972  echoed the universal indignation in the face of the virulent tribalism of Rwanda:""The ethnic crystallization in fact began in Rwanda  where discriminations of this type were always more advanced and more extreme and the revolution which broke out there in 1959  with its sequels which lasted until 1963  established a 'panhutu' regime  which saw the violent disappearance of some 20 000 Batutsi (the most terrible genocide that had occurred since that of the Jews  as Bertrand Russell said) as well as the forced expulsion of 200 000 others. These refugees are still today in camps  as are their Palestinian counterparts. The Rwanda example was decisive with regard to the evolution of Burundi  to the extent that the Hutu putsch of 1965  which was also accompanied by massacres"" of the Tutsi-children  women and old people-""in the Muramvya region  seemed to be bringing the country into the same vicious circle.""But fortunately the authorities were vigilant.39.	As the annihilation of our peoples was hatched with the complicity of Rwanda  the Foreign Minister of that country dares to state  in regard to the number of victims in Burundi  that ""more than 200 000 innocent victims have been massacred"" [2054th meeting  para. 22.]40.	This is the same number as was propagated from Rwanda and spread throughout the world. The Belgian newspapers Le Soir  La Cite and Remarques Africaines  in connivance with the Rwanda authorities  competed with each other in spreading and advertising this ""made in Rwanda"" product.41.	The number of targets was predetermined between Kigali and the exterminating agents  and without doubt Mr. Munyaneza is confusing his plan and the results actually achieved. Under that plan hundreds of thousands of Burundi citizens were doomed to systematic elimination. Nevertheless  some 25 000 assailants  which included a number of Rwandese  did not succeed in fully fulfilling their plan  for they met with the heroic resistance of the Burundi people  hence the crushing defeat inflicted on the attackers  which reduced to a quarter the number of targets which the Rwanda plan provided for in its first phase. Certainly the 50 000 Burundi citizens who were annihilated in the course of the first few days by the attackers represent a terrible calamity and a sad loss for our country 42.	This turn of events thwarted the diabolical consequences planned on by the Rwanda Government. We have already invoked the reasons why we made these great sacrifices  particularly in view of our wish to bring about the fraternization of the African continent. With the purpose of camouflaging its enormous guilt in these fratricidal crimes  Rwanda sent its Foreign Minister in June to foreign capitals in Asia and Europe  But it is more than high time that the country of Rwanda dispelled its own illusions  because Rwanda must be told that it does not possess the monopoly of the friendship of Asian and European Governments  which  contrary to the hopes of Rwanda  are very little disposed to believe naively everything it says implicitly.43.	The magnanimity of our Government towards Rwanda was not confined to keeping silent on the role of that country in the program of extermination. While there were quite a number of Rwanda citizens among the 20 000 attackers who died on the battlefield  Burundi preferred reserve to open denunciation of Rwanda. Can any more convincing proof against that Government be asked for than the fact that the 300 Rwanda nationals who were captured were repatriated  except for 36 of them  who are still in the hands of the Burundi authorities? In the light of the mildness that our Government lavished on Rwanda in spite of its direct and flagrant participation in the plot designed to decimate our people  it is staggering to hear the Foreign Minister of Rwanda proclaim at once his innocence and his indignation. Certainly the nightmare which haunts him stems both from the overwhelming facts against his country in our possession and from the crushing defeat of his compatriots whom he sent to commit aggression against Burundi. According to the Rwandese thesis  the Hutu of Burundi are sunk in poverty and are exploited by the ""Tutsi overlords"". If Rwanda were to be tempted to fail to recognize the criminal role which it assigned to its nationals  we would be reduced to asking it about the motives of the hundreds of Rwandese irregulars who were found on our Territory.44.	Let us admit for a moment the theory of the Rwanda regime that the Hutu in Burundi are in distress and those in Rwanda are wallowing in opulence. We still have to ask Kigali whether they sent the successive waves of Rwanda irregulars to our country to join in the martyrdom of the Burundi Hutu or to commit crimes.45.	Those irregulars  after having undergone intensive training in subversion  were sent to Burundi by stealth and clandestinely. Fearing that they would run into our forces of order from the very first moment they attempted to tread on Burundi soil under irregular conditions  the subversive agents coming from Rwanda infiltrated into Burundi through neighboring countries  whose good faith they abused. Such fraud is liable not only to bring about open conflict between Rwanda and Burundi  but also to embroil the latter country with its neighboring brotherly countries. The Foreign Minister of Rwanda was very ingenious in trying to condemn publicly the ""systematic genocide"" of which his own country was the principal organizer!46.	Mr. Munyaneza from this very rostrum repeated this imaginary number of 200 000 people massacred  a number which initially was waved around by Rwanda in order to arouse pressure abroad which would tend to make the guilty innocent. Could Rwanda reveal to us the genius thanks to which it was able to count the victims? While it is undeniably established that the Rwandese contributed to the massacres  it nevertheless seems impossible for their agents to know the number of victims  since the agents who came from Rwanda were  for the most part  mowed down in the course of battle or captured.47.	The Government of Burundi  for its part  was in a position to count the victims by means of all its military personnel  the Party  the national youth  the Union of Burundese Women and the Union of Burundese Workers  who were all mobilized in order to honor the mortal remains of their brothers and sisters who were immolated for this high ideal  namely  the indivisibility of the Burundese people.48.	All this is to the credit of the unity and determination of our people to struggle against invaders who want to import systems which have been condemned by history.49.	In the light of these facts and in such circumstances  how can Rwanda and those who have so ingeniously manipulated this random number be in a position to be better informed about the number of dead than the Burundi Government itself? We should like an answer to this question.50.	What are we to say about the hundreds of thousands of human heads which fell in Rwanda in the course of the genocide committed in the name of the Hutu tribe from 1959 to 1964? We do not hear the Rwanda Government decrying this holocaust which it caused in order to establish a Hutu State.51.	Leaving aside Pretoria  there is not in the world any country other than Rwanda with a regime that systematically excludes all other ethnic entities from the Government  from Parliament and from the Party.52.	In the event that Rwanda is inclined to contest this fact  the Government of Bujumbura on behalf of which I have the honor of speaking here  would be ready to have a mission sent-preferably from the OAU  or  if not  from the United Nations. That mission would go to our two countries in order to carry out an inquiry. In Burundi it would note that all of our successive Governments  ever since the reconquering of our independence in 1962  have included  without any exception  Hutu and Tutsi which were alternately majorities according to the criterion of individual abilities. The list of all the candidates and the elective posts were drawn up by the Union of National Progress [UPRONA]  the mass party which  in the legislative elections supervised by the United Nations in 1961  obtained 94 per cent of the votes on the basis of the universal suffrage of all men and women 18 years of age and above  illiterate as well as literate.53.	However  the Rwanda system hermetically closes the doors of Government  of Parliament and of the Party to all its sons and daughters who  by accident of birth  did not happen to be Hutus.54.	Hitherto we have confined ourselves to drawing up a list of all the misdeeds and atrocities committed by the Rwanda political regime. It is time now to trace the causes. Indeed  the theoreticians of that apartheid a la Hutu advocated as long ago as 1959 the creation of South African-type ""Bantustans"". In order to permit members to judge this  it suffices to read out the text of a telegram addressed in 1959 to the United Nations and to the Belgian Government by Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda  founder of the Hutu Party and the present President of Rwanda. It reads as follows:""We Hutu represent 85 per cent of the people of Rwanda. We insistently call for racial peace with collaboration of the Belgian authorities and fear the worst for the whole country if they do not accept the geographical partition into Hutu zone and Tutsi zone. We Hutus declare furthermore that we wish to collaborate with the Belgian authorities as long as the democratization of the country  peace and progress require it for the Hutu emancipation movement. (Signed) Kayibanda.""55.	After the gloomy picture depicted above  what further proof is needed that Rwanda remains the most fertile breeding-ground of those forces which are determined to undermine and weaken the independence  sovereignty and racial harmony of Africa  forces which yesterday seriously threatened the integrity of Zaire  severed from Katanga  and which  immediately thereafter advocated the creation of a Biafra torn from Nigeria. And is it not that very same Rwanda which served as a haven for mercenaries whose claim to fame was the sowing of desolation in a sister republic  an influential member of the OAU?56.	The repeated participation of that country in genocidal plots successively organized against our people  its tribalization of all the political organs on the model of the colonialist and nazi regimes  and its granting of refuge to a mercenary clique  constitutes a trilogy which in itself suffices to demonstrate that Rwanda is nothing less than a bridgehead of the recolonization of Africa  or rather a pocket of unrepentant colonialism.57.	The extreme gravity of Rwandan interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and the low blows it struck in the unsuccessful attempt at genocide require redress by Kigali.58.	Moreover  any renewed attempt is liable to lead to dire ""results for which Rwanda will be fully responsible.59.	The obligation upon the Government of Kigali to renounce for ever its interference in the events and situations occurring in Burundi  on the strange pretext of universalizing Hutu militancy in a sovereign State  is necessary also in the case of the refugees.60.	Our Government has complied with the letter and the spirit of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  .signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and with the Protocol on Mediation  Conciliation and Arbitration of the OAU  to such an extent that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has  in his annual report ever since 1966  described Burundi as the ""pilot country"" in this area.61.	Thus  more than 100 000 Rwandan refugees have found refuge in our country in their attempt to escape from the genocide of 1959-1964 and have been  for the most part  settled in regions distant from the center. The necessary measures have been taken to prevent them from adversely affecting the security of Rwanda and those measures have been and continue to remain quite effective.62.	At a time when every effort is made and all forces combined to consolidate the OAU in particular  at a time when all countries are busy forming great regional and continental groupings  it is imperative to put an end to the primitive conception of power which hampers the surge towards economic co-operation amongst peoples and the harmonization of relations among States.63.	Burundi  for its part  profoundly attached to the well-being of the human race  is determined to associate itself with the growing universal movement to bring about a general improvement in the economic and international monetary system.64.	Important events which have occurred recently have revealed the fragility  the disadvantages and the disappointments inherent in the international situation within the field of economic development.65.	The monetary crisis which broke out in August 1971 and its consequences have revealed clearly the need for a revision of the international monetary system. Developing countries  which are in no way responsible for that crisis resulting from an imbalance between developed countries  are obliged to be the sufferers today of the principal adverse effects of the uncertainties born of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the subsequent monetary readjustments.66.	A solution of the monetary crisis must not impose any additional burden on the developing countries  which have unreservedly co-operate in the efforts undertaken to maintain the stability of the international monetary system. Quite the contrary; special corrective measures should be taken to compensate them for their losses.67.	It is particularly important for the developing countries to make an effective contribution to the establishment of an international monetary system which would be most in keeping with their interests. The revision of the international monetary system should be studied with the effective participation of third world countries at every stage. It cannot constitute a preserve of the ""Group of 10"" alone. This revision of the Bretton Woods system should serve to bring about a solution of our development problems.68.	We note with regret that the position of the developing countries in the field of international trade  upon which their economy largely depends  continues to worsen.69.	Burundi endorses the idea that developing countries should not be kept out of the preparations for new world-wide negotiations on international trade which are to take place next year.70.	In the course of those negotiations  special arrangements should be worked out to give an important place to the developing countries. Those countries should be given the opportunity to participate fully  continuously  at every stage of the negotiations.71.	Our Government attaches particular importance to solutions which will be found to problems of commodities and all measures affecting access to markets J and price policies  including international machinery for the stabilization of prices  the effectiveness of existing international agreements on commodities  and any new agreements reached will be of the utmost importance to us.72.	The generalized system of preferences  in order to be more effective  should provide for the inclusion in its plans of all primary commodities which constitute the very basis of the economy of most developing countries.73.	We note with pessimism that government aid to the poorer countries is declining and that the burden of their debt is growing heavier. The recent devaluation of the dollar and the revaluation of other currencies resulted in raising the nominal value of the external debt of the third world  expressed in dollars.74.	There persists profound disagreement between developing countries as to the nature of measures to be taken to resolve the problems of indebtedness. The debates of the recent session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] confirmed this once again. We agree with the content of resolution 59 (III)   which calls upon the Trade and Development Board to institute within the framework of UNCTAD a special agency to find practical solutions to the problems which the developing countries face in the matter of debt-servicing.75.	In view of the gravity of the situation in which the developing countries find themselves in regard to their indebtedness  it is highly desirable that the conditions upon which aid is provided should be reasonable.76.	The attainment of the objective of 1 per cent of the gross national product or a financial contribution of the target of 0.7 per cent for public assistance to development and the establishment of a link between the special drawing rights and additional financial resources for development  will contribute  we are convinced  to a resolution of the difficulties of a financial type which are encountered by the developing countries.77.	Burundi attaches great importance to economic co-operation and regional integration among developing countries.78.	The United Nations must pay particular attention to the long-term prospects of economic and social development  in order to view development within the broader framework of an indivisible world  in which all nations are interdependent. An over-all conception of development means that the United Nations should  here and now  assume greater responsibility in the achievement of economic development which would be better balanced at the international level.79.	In order to bring about an over-all development  it is important to recognize the role of regional co-operation. The regional economic commissions have already acquired great experience in this field and hence constitute  within the framework of the United Nations  a point of convergence of the national  subregional  regional and world development efforts.80.	An important question which is at the center of our attention is the inalienable right of the developing countries to exercise their sovereignty over their own natural resources and to take all the necessary measures to develop those resources in the interests of the economic and social development of their people. All measures or economic or political pressures from the outside  prejudicial to those rights  constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. That is why we support any measure which would provide for the creation of a revolving fund of the United Nations for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources.81.	We share the concern of most Governments at the sometimes nefarious role played by international companies in the economic and social development of certain developing countries and associate ourselves with those countries which call for an expert group to study the influence of international companies in the process of development  in order to formulate conclusions which would be taken into account by Governments when they set their development policies.82.	We understand the importance attached today to the problems of environment. However  we must agree that the problems of environment which face the developing countries differ from those which face the developed countries. That is why we must allot resources to the preservation and improvement of the environment  while taking account of the particular needs of the developing countries.83.	At the present time we are witnessing great sympathy and international solidarity towards the developing countries that are the least developed. Our country properly appreciates and understands the measures contemplated for the benefit of that group of countries  to which we  unfortunately  belong.84.	In tackling problems of development the organs of the United Nations especially the United Nations Development Program like certain bilateral donors recognize that the least advanced countries and the land-locked countries should benefit from measures which would make it possible for them to profit equitably from international development policies  and we should lay stress on some of these measures.85.	Technical assistance  including training  can increase the capacity for absorption of capital inflows to developing countries  especially the least advanced of them  and in this regard it is important to co-ordinate technical assistance efforts from all organizations  both multilateral and bilateral.86.	Economic regional integration and co-operation constitutes one of these measures to the extent that it can solve problems such as the smallness of domestic markets and the question of natural and human resources  as well as the problem of limited financial resources which these countries suffer from.87.	The most advanced countries among the developing countries can plan an important role in helping the least advanced. This assistance can be given both within and outside the framework of regional economic co-operation agreements.88.	Within the realm of trade policy  we must have special supplementary measures favoring the least developed countries. There is the possibility of reducing  for example  the quota restrictions applicable to the exports of the least advanced countries and lowering taxes on tropical products  limiting non-tariff obstacles  identifying and eliminating restrictive trade practices  stabilizing the prices of tropical products and increasing the number of products to which the generalized system of preferences would apply so as to embrace products whose export is of particular interest and importance to the least-advanced countries.89.	The least developed of the developing countries  whose economy is based essentially on agriculture  cannot develop as long as their resources within the field of agriculture are backward. It is important  therefore  that special measures to improve the agriculture of the least- advanced should be adopted.90.	Our country also encounters difficulties because of the fact that it is land-locked. In order to meet these difficulties it needs technical assistance  particularly in order to improve its transport infrastructure.91.	Burundi will endorse any regional or subregional project in the transport field and will support any measures designed to help the land-locked countries by special freight rates and by facilitating the transit of their goods through neighboring countries.92.	Economic exchange and co-operation have always been the basis of the deepest links of the solidarity between men belonging to the same family  the same village  the same town and the same country; so why should international economic co-operation not play a unifying role for the whole world community?93.	The development of means of transport  radio  newspapers  international meetings are in the process of eliminating geographical barriers which separate or which formerly separated peoples  and promoting international economic relations. As is the case within States  economic mutual assistance should contribute to a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth among nations and put an end to the systematic exploitation of the poorest by the richest.94.	The elimination of injustice and exploitation among States is without doubt the most powerful factor promoting world peace  prosperity and the continued progress of mankind.95.	But all these objectives  all these noble goals which are contained in the United Nations Charter can be achieved only if all the peoples of the world join hands in an upsurge of solidarity and fraternity to rekindle the flame of San. Francisco  which has stirred the hearts of all men of goodwill who have joined together against the great scourges of humanity.96.	It is in that spirit that we wish every success to this session of the General Assembly and happiness and prosperity for all peoples."
"8",473,"BEL",27,1972,"Every year  during the general debate  we inform each other of the undertakings and hopes of our respective countries; but our overriding duty is to deal with problems that are common to all mankind  those which we must tackle together in the knowledge that  if we fail to solve them  we run the risk of frustrating the hopes and efforts of each and every one of our nations.75.	I am struck by the fact that the analyses made in order to identify the key problems of mankind converge  to an increasing extent  on the same issues.76.	In the introduction to your report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l]  Mr. Secretary-General  you told us that co-operation and solidarity were essential in four main areas and that we must face up to and overcome without delay four global dangers: insecurity  overpopulation  the deterioration of the environment  and the persistent poverty of the majority of the world's population. This enumeration confirms the one to which U Thant drew our attention from this same rostrum four years ago. It also coincides  in the main  with the documents published this year by the ""Rome Club"". This does got mention the political factor of fear  of insecurity but  on the other hand  it does add a further element: the danger that the non-renewable natural resources may be exhausted for lack of control over industrial development.77.	Everything then indicates that we must act at three different levels. First of all  we must rid ourselves of insecurity and violence in all their manifestations; 25 years after the foundation of the United Nations  the balance of terror can no longer suffice for us. Next  we must reassert our will to base our relations on a permanent dialog. The Secretary-General referred in this regard to the ""balance of prudence"". Should we not go further still and aim at ""stability through co-operation""?78.	Last but not least  there is a new task which the international community as such must undertake  an objective which is even more difficult to attain than the others because it aims at creating a balance which we are just starting to think about: the balance of growth.79.	We cannot ignore the warning issued by U Thant four years ago. He said:""I do not wish to seem over-dramatic  but I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary-General that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps 10 years left""-six now ""in which to get together  forget their ancient quarrels . .. and to supply the required momentum to achieve a fairer and more balanced kind of growth. If such an agreement is not reached within the next decade  then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control.""This is the same question you asked of us today  Mr. Secretary-General.80.	Belgium's answer to your threefold question is a positive one. We do want to build up a system of security on a less fragile basis than the balance of fear. We have set out resolutely on the path of co-operation and we wish to go further than the balance that is the result of mere prudence. Above all we want to help to establish the only balance capable of guaranteeing peace in the years to come: the balance of growth.81.	The first and most obvious of the threats  the threat of Armageddon  is still the continuing build-up of armaments of every kind. On this subject there are some projects  some partial achievements that foreshadow  albeit tentatively  the resolutions which we await with almost too much impatience. We do not wish to underestimate the results of a general nature which are being sought through the organization of a world disarmament conference or by reaffirming our support of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  but what seems even more important to us is concrete action in the following three areas.82.	Three years ago we all stressed  as was appropriate  the probable political significance of the entry into force of a treaty prohibiting the spread of nuclear weapons.83.	During the recent meeting in Moscow between President Nixon and Mr. Brezhnev an agreement was reached on 26 May 1972 limiting the development of intercontinental nuclear weapons. This is a first step  which we welcome as a consequence of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]. It is worth remembering that the nuclear States have in fact undertaken to limit their nuclear potential. Had there been no result  moreover  the non-nuclear weapon States would have been able to ask for a review of the Treaty on the expiration of the first five-year period.84.	The members of the European Community  for their part  have actively pursued negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna with a view to reaching an agreement oil the application of safeguards. Fortunately  this agreement has been finalized; it upholds the provisions of the Treaty on non-proliferation and takes into account the particular characteristics of the European Community and Belgium  therefore  like its European partners  will shortly be asking its Parliament to ratify the agreement.85.	Thus  a major step forward has been taken and it is worth while highlighting it. We earnestly hope that before the end of the first five-year term further progress will have been made towards nuclear disarmament.86.	There is a second specific reason for concern. Belgium has long been convinced that it would be difficult to establish any kind of security system unless there is some rule to govern the supply of arms. This  as we are well aware  is a delicate problem which concerns both the countries that purchase weapons and those which supply them. A discussion here of this subject could lay the groundwork for an international convention establishing at least some principles which both the supplying and the purchasing countries would undertake to apply.87.	This discussion would be all the more thorough if  in the meantime  One or mOte institutes concerned with  war and peace were to concentrate their research on the preparation of such a draft international convention. The General Assembly will remember that  on our initiative  it adopted last year a iesQlution on research into peace and War [resolution 2817 (%XVI)J. It agreed that the Secretary-General should submit to it the next year his first summary report on the main Achievements of the institutes engaged in War theory research. My country hopes that  starting from 1973  this research will include one or more studies on international rules governing the supply of arms. We could then discuss them here. Right now  Belgium would be prepared to Support arty draft which would meet with the acceptance of a sufficiently large number of States that purchase arms.88.	A third effort to promote disarmament is under way. Some European States  including our own  made specific proposals iii 1968 for a balanced and mutual reduction of forces in Central Europe. This initiative is particularly well justified at a time when the suggestions for organizing a conference on European security and co-operation have taken shape; for the two proposals are actually interrelated. How could oUr peoples accept us as responsible statesmen if  after a solemn European conference  at which we affirmed our will to reach an understanding  we were unable to demonstrate any real progress in the area of regional disarmament? What credibility could be placed in our endeavors if our military stockpiles continued to grow even after we had stated our intention of not using them?89.	To judge from recent talks with the USSR  a desire for progress in this area too seems to be emerging. We should make certain of this by initiating actual negotiations at the earliest opportunity.90.	It is my hope that at the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly the nations of Europe will be the bearers of good tidings  both as regards the organization of security and co-operation in Europe and as regards regional disarmament.91.	But another fear exists today  a fear generated by the spread of violence throughout the entire world  a violence whose motivations are sometimes political and sometimes ideological  social or racial  where they are not simply based on greed. These crimes are always odious  and the fear they generate is justified  for the victims of the hijackings  kidnappings  the taking of hostages  wanton destruction with plastic bombs and firing on crowds are more often than not innocent people thrust into the forefront like shields. These crimes are proliferating in every corner of the globe  even the furthest removed from the areas of conflict; they are not the dubious privilege of any particular region  and the whole world is thus faced with a unique kind of problem. The Secretary-General was therefore right to raise it.92.	And the unique problem  as we see it is  what protective or punitive action can our Organization suggest or take? What rules can be proposed for all States to apply when faced with such crimes? And if these rules were adopted  what should be the collective behavior of our States  were these rules to be violated? Secretary of State Rogers has made some specific proposals on this [2038th meeting].93.	Belgium hopes that this unfortunately universal problem which has been referred to our Legal Committee will be taken up without reference to any particular manifestation of this evil  but in an effort to determine what joint collective attitudes might have been useful at each critical moment in the recent past  and those which might prevent their recurrence wherever it may be. For the work of our Legal Committee to be fruitful  we believe that it should be informed by three common ideas.94.	First  there is no question that we all bear responsibility for seeking to eliminate the known causes of often desperate acts. Repression cannot save a society whose citizens are convinced that revolt is their only recourse.95.	But  second  we must recognize that no injustice suffered will ever justify the injustice of acts of terrorism. Since  according to the philosophy of the United Nations  war should always give way to negotiation or arbitration as our Charter states it follows that whenever wanton violence is fostered by individuals or groups of individuals  that  too  must be condemned by the canons of the same international order.96.	Wanton violence can never justify equally wanton revenge. When international public order is disrupted  an escalation of violence is just as reprehensible.97.	My country also shares the concern of the Secretary- General regarding another form of violence  that which has arisen several times in recent years in Asia  Africa and Europe  involving the death of many innocent civilians. I am referring to the most serious forms of internal warfare. Belgium has been deeply shocked in the last few years  and again quite recently  by several such cases. None of our countries by itself can  without creating serious public confrontation  go further  in making its representations to a State that is torn internally  than to express the anxiety or condemnation of its own public opinion. But we realize that the victims in those countries do not understand our official semi-silence. Of course the organizations of the United Nations family and also the new agency for co-ordinating efforts in the event of disaster do come to the aid of the survivors; that is fine  but we do not believe it is enough. The voice of the world's conscience the only one powerful enough to halt the slaughter ought to be able to make itself heard on these occasions. Will the United Nations be able  and does it indeed have the will  to lay down principles of action - to limit by mutual consent the exclusive sovereignty of our States? Can we reconcile respect for the sacredness of human life with Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter?98.	We would like to address an appeal to the international non-governmental organizations which are seeking to ensure respect for human rights. Could they not devote their efforts to this serious problem which is so important for human dignity and make specific suggestions on action they advocate? Belgium pledges itself to do everything in its power to ensure that these proposals  based on the opinions of men of goodwill throughout the world  will be taken up at the next session of the General Assembly.99.	This appeal addressed to the international non-governmental organizations  gives me an opportunity in passing to underline their growing importance. Today The Union of International Associations numbers more than 2 500 such organizations as compared with 560 in 1965. It is a sound idea  therefore  to consider in the spirit of the Charter the increasingly effective participation of the non-governmental organizations in international action.100.	It was you  Mr. Secretary-General  who coined the expression ""balance of prudence"" to denote a certain degree of progress  namely the fact that groups  nations and States  hitherto hostile  were manifestly striving towards dialog  understanding and negotiation and  indeed  sometimes reconciliation. You quote some recent cases which are in all our minds: the German States  North Korea and South Korea  India and Pakistan. Mr. Rogers  for his part  has mentioned all the other efforts at rapprochement which are being made.101.	We cannot just sit back and congratulate ourselves on this. What part can the international community play  either on a world-wide basis or at the regional level  to create a state of stability through co-operation? This is a vast subject and I shall confine myself to some ideas about two lines of action.102.	As regards peace  our ^Organization bears special responsibilities in the Middle East. We must ask ourselves if it is accomplishing all that is expected of it. The cease-fire is still in force  but it has not been possible to halt the destructive sequence of acts of violence and reprisals. The Soviet disengagement from Egypt has reduced the danger of a polarization of the conflict between the super-Powers  but after five years the peoples that confront each other are still somewhere in between war and peace.103.	For us the basis of a negotiated solution remains Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which the great Powers and the principal States concerned supported. I know it is five years old  but it is not obsolete; it contains the principles of an agreement. It would be otiose  in our view  to interpret it or to try to improve on it. Its practical implementation is principally the responsibility of the parties  aided by those designated by the United Nations to assist them. In this connexion I wish to pay a tribute to the efforts we have witnessed  particularly those of U Thant and Mr. Jarring and those which you  Mr. Secretary- General  have made.104.	Another definite prospect was President El-Sadat's proposal of 4 February 1971 and the interest likewise shown by Israel in seeking an interim solution which would include the reopening of the Suez Canal. If this agreement is acted upon it will prove that mutually beneficial arrangements can be reached between States which are still somewhere between war and peace. Other partial approaches can be imagined. The important thing in our view is that a constructive move should be made to end a dangerous state of immobility. It would then be possible to tackle  with higher hopes  other problems connected with an over-all solution. And a particular place must be reserved here for the problem of the Palestinian people.105.	We would like to think that  at the outset of the search for an interim solution  it would be possible to identify the principles common to all the parties which are already explicitly set forth in resolution 242 (1967). We  for our part  have always attached particular importance to the twofold preliminary declaration which stresses both ""the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war"" and ""the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security"".106.	Is this not an established fact? If so  it would be easier to agree that the declared positions of each of the parties on matters under dispute are not ultimatums but only negotiating terms.107.	Peace will never come without the agreement of all the parties  but it is for our Organization to help them in this as effectively as possible. I should like to say in conclusion on this problem that if the European Community can make some contribution to peace-making -Belgium would repeat what it has often stated here: its assistance in the economic and social rehabilitation of the peoples which have suffered most from the war would be  and I hope will be  the most effective contribution of the European Economic Community.108.	I have just described the mission of Europe in the world-wide movement for closer ties. My country openly rejoices at the fact that Europe  as a continent  is moving ahead resolutely towards co-operation  stability and detente. The continuing development and enlargement of the European communities are a solid guarantee of this; the active preparation of the conference on European security is another. Let me to tell you something about these two events which are such important milestones on the road  towards that future world harmony which in our opinion will find its most reliable basis in regional structures and stages.109.	As regards the process of building Western Europe  no one can remain indifferent to the fact that neighboring countries  governed by the same principles of parliamentary democracy  are joining together in a common destiny-after having  for the last few centuries  shaken the world with their confrontations. The only reason for concern to which this progressive union might give rise would be that this Europe  in becoming a leading commercial and economic Power  might not assume all the world responsibilities flowing from its new status.110.	From this very rostrum Sir Alec Douglas-Home vigorously rejected this idea in his statement at the 2042nd meeting. He expressed our common conviction. I shall shortly refer to all that this enlarged Community should contribute in order to promote a genuine balance of growth.111.	But  however proud we may feel at having built a new community  we are well aware that it does not represent all of Europe. The States of our continent have chosen different paths: some have chosen a common destiny within the Community; others prefer neutrality or non-involvement  which debars them from any delegation of sovereignty; the last group is governed by a system of State economy. But among these three groups  or in these States as a whole  there has been a proliferation of bilateral agreements over the past few years  and now the prospect of the forthcoming conference on European security paves the way for a multilateral meeting such as has not occurred since 1815 at which the problems of common interest will be discussed simultaneously by all the States concerned.112.	The time has not yet come to lay the basis for a permanent understanding among the countries of our continent. The fundamental values on which our systems are based are too different and the goals we pursue are too dissimilar.113.	But if we succeed in this first attempt we will have initiated a process. We know it will be long and difficult  but it could lead to a permanent understanding on a continental scale. We would then have proved that it is only through co-operation that the conditions for genuine stability and peace can be created something which no one would dream of challenging.114.	I come now to my third subject. Up to now I have spoken about the strictly political aspects of relations between States  but we are aware that they are no longer the only ones to claim priority as matters of international concern. We are faced with a whole new dimension in world problems. We see the suddenly increasing complexity of a problem which both affects and involves all living beings  because we have to answer a global question: can we  and for how long preserve a physically and socially inhabitable earth? Each human being  each thinking man on our planet  whether he lives in an affluent or a needy society  is asking himself that question. It is then that basic questions are asked. How far can human reproduction go? Must we save non-renewable mineral resources? How can we prevent the destruction of the natural environment? Is food production limitless? Is the interminable material growth of certain types of production in the developed societies conceivable in itself  and this in the face of the continuing stagnation or retrogression of the underdeveloped societies?115.	All these are questions which no State can any longer solve on its own and for itself. But all these are questions to which our specialized agencies  each in the field of competence indicated by its title  can supply partial answers. And here  there is some reason for gratification that this year of 1972 has witnessed the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago  Chile  and the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. An important world conference on population is to be held in 1974. But we are aware that all the partial or sectoral answers provided by specialized world conferences or agencies must hence forth be co-ordinated. Where will the co-ordinating be done? How can we organize for the whole world a new balance of growth in which the ecological  economic and social plans would of necessity be interdependent?116.	At present there is only one organization in the world which can ask that question with authority and recommend the gradual formulation of a policy in which each component will have to be linked with several others. That is our own Organization.117.	We would like to make a suggestion: that we begin with the preparation of a joint declaration on the aims of and means for a new balance of growth. If you believe that this is a necessary and an urgent task  to whom should it be assigned?118.	On 3 October [2050th meeting] my colleague and friend  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands  Mr. Schmelzer  raised a very similar question  even though we had not consulted together beforehand. He told us that the Economic and Social Council was the central forum for formulating a co-ordinated policy. We are well aware that that prospect has been followed very closely by the Latin American countries. Mr. de Seynes  in his report to the Second Committee at its 1449th meeting  made another proposal and suggested UNITAR. We would draw the attention of the Assembly to this matter  and we know that the Secretary-General will take it up.119.	The balanced growth of mankind in each of its components is a problem on which we can see a collective awareness is emerging. It is in any event the duty of the United Nations to tackle it.120.	The global question I have just raised totally transcends the question of underdevelopment  but in putting it in this way it is not our intention to play down or in any way to set aside the responsibility of the developed countries towards the developing countries. On the contrary  I wish to express the hope that the enlarged European Community for its part will  at its forthcoming solemn session in Paris  provide the beginning of a reply to this problem when it outlines its foreign policy for the coming decade in its relations with the southern hemisphere.121.	In this area  it seems to me  everything points to Europe as the area for taking the first step.122.	Now  through its enlargement it has become the world's leading trading power and in many respects the world's leading economic power.123.	Now  after having closed the colonial chapter in the world's history book  it has found in the equality of States and the mutual respect of independent States  and also in long-established mutual understanding  a kind of privileged relationship with most countries.124.	Now  by dint of its very situation between the super-Powers  its friendship with North America  by the detente in the east  it has no designs for remote political control and its defense responsibilities are limited to its own area in other words  its military establishment and budget are both of moderate size.125.	Finally  for a quarter of a century now  it has been accustomed to seeking the progressive redistribution of the benefits of its growth to promote the social welfare of its own citizens. All it has to do now  therefore  is to get used to extending the same solidarity to the third world.126.	At this point in its history  such a Europe seems to me to be well placed to make the first offers to other regions of the world  without at the same time overlooking its duties to the developing countries.127.	Let us therefore help to ensure that the tariff negotiations of 1973 will provide the developing countries with the maximum advantages; that the new monetary structures will forge new links between the wealthiest countries and the others. In this connexion the decisions taken last month by the International Monetary Fund are on the right lines. Let us also provide greater access to a common market for the manufactured goods produced by the Group of 77 developing countries. Let us contribute  on a case-by-case basis  to the stabilization of commodity prices and  finally  establish the order of magnitude-which will increase over the next 10 years of how much can be voluntarily siphoned off from European prosperity towards development. Belgium  for its part  is in favor of all these steps.128.	I have just described what we hope the countries of the European Community can do to break away from the balance of fear  to rise above the balance of prudence and to achieve the balance of growth. But all of Europe  in the process of rapprochement  will make its contribution  too.129.	Mr. President  you are a European  a citizen of the great nation of Poland in which the civilization of our continent flourishes. Belgium welcomes your leadership of this Assembly. I remember that the renowned Minister of Foreign Affairs  Mr. Rapacki  was in 1966 one of the first to speak to us about a conference on European security and the balanced reduction of forces. Indeed  one of the drafts bore his name.130.	It will be understood why  in mentioning and saluting your presidency  Sir  I should call to mind and associate with our tribute to the President of the General Assembly the memory of another great European: a statesman who  27 years ago  presided over the first General Assembly of the United Nations  Paul-Henri Spaak who passed away a few weeks ago. How can we forget a voice and a mind of such resonance  devoted to the noble cause of peace and European reconstruction. That is why I wish to evoke his memory today.131.	Mr. Secretary-General  knowing you as the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations  as belonging to one of the most noble peoples of old Europe  and as a Minister for Foreign Affairs whom we have seen at work  we have been able to appreciate your devotion to the cause of a more united Europe  transcending ideological differences and respecting the identity of each of its States. Belgium conveys to you  through me  its congratulations and the assurance of its full co-operation. By today responding  in essence  to the questions posed in the introduction to your report [A/8701/Add.l] we have sought to demonstrate the importance we attach to your initiative.132.	And so my concluding words are a promise: Mr. Secretary-General  you can count on the support of Belgium."
"9",519,"BEN",27,1972,"Mr. President  representing my country once again in the General Assembly of our Organization  it is a pleasant duty for me to express to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This honor done to your personal qualities is also a tribute to the great country you represent for its indefatigable contribution to the cause of peace. And there is no reason to conceal the fact here that Poland itself has recently given evidence of its attachment to peace when its leaders agreed a little more than a year ago to settle peacefully an old frontier quarrel which rendered precarious a true normalization of the situation stemming from the Second World War. The Treaty of Warsaw  concluded and signed on 18 November 1970 between the People's Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany  13 can in itself justify the confidence we have in your country  through you  in organizing and conducting the proceedings of this session. With its acute sensitivity to measure and balance  the heritage of a culture drawn from the sources of the Europe of classicism  the people of Poland has always set an example of moderation and justice in its relations with the rest of the world. This people  which was divided more than once in the course of its history  has preserved its unity thanks to its genius and the force of its persevering and enduring nationalism. This nobility and this breadth of soul of your countrymen  together with your personal qualities  which are familiar to us all  allow us to predict that your election to the presidency of this Assembly will inject new life in the Organization  which will truly make of it a center for the search for peace and international security.194.	Permit me now  Mr. President  to pay a particular tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  for his great competence  tact and courtesy in conducting the proceedings of the twenty-sixth session.195.	It is in the nature of things that any human enterprise from time to time requires an injection of new resources of invention and ingenuity to ensure its normal progress and to improve its results. Our new Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  about whom you will allow me to say a few words  has already showed that he measures up in more than one respect to the task that faces him. His many trips to Africa  Europe and more recently to Asia have been the occasion for broad diplomatic action whose impact on the international situation will be very important for the future of our Organization. His efforts to improve the financial situation of the Organization cannot be overlooked because they have already yielded appreciable results. We must recognize that in such a short time our Secretary-General has performed some positive tasks in the service of the Organization. For that alone he deserves our warm congratulations and admiration.196.	Everything suggests that Africa will be for a long time to come the sick continent of the century and the most long suffering one or our planet. With the multitude of problems which beset it on all fronts and the procession of misfortunes and frustrations which have afflicted entire generations in this world which is supposed to be so modern and civilized  we are entitled to wonder whether men have not reached a point of resignation where they 'take a kind of gloomy delight in witnessing the contrasts constituted by liberty and unconcern. The passivity with which some people view the repeated violations of fundamental human rights which manifest themselves in the form of a cruel racial discrimination in southern Africa and the atrocious wars of reconquest in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) calls into question the whole international code of ethics which gave birth to this Organization. But if there are nations which still believe in the validity of the purposes and the objectives of the Charter then the time has come for them to take a stand in choosing between a new awakening for the construction of a better world for everyone and a return to a quite recent past when the right of might prevailed over the might of right. We should like still to hope that the reasons of the heart and of morality will succeed in replacing the cold logic of material interests which the folly of men has tended to place in the position of highest priority.197.	Some striking facts of contemporary political affairs in recent months do justify some hope. The meetings of the Security Council in the African city of Addis Ababa in January and February of this year was the occasion for us to convince the great Powers of the Tightness of our cause and to bring to the attention of world public opinion the fact that our struggle against racial oppression and colonialism perpetrated against a large portion of our continent is a just one. In spite of the reluctance of the administering Power and of some others to associate themselves with the Security Council resolutions on Rhodesia  the conclusions of the Pearce Commission  have made it quite clear that henceforth there is no point in trying to decide the destiny of African peoples without their own participation. This is a lesson which should be pondered  particularly by the South African  Rhodesian and Portuguese Governments.198.	Furthermore  the agreement recently reached with the South African authorities for the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General for Namibia constitutes a step forward  for which we wish to congratulate our Secretary-General. Nevertheless  I should like to make it clear that for us the final goal still remains self-determination and independence for the people of Namibia.199.	The tragic internal conflict which rent the Sudan for almost 17 years has just been brought to a happy end thanks to the mediation of the African Conference of Churches and His Majesty Haile Selassie I  Emperor ofEthiopia. This is a great victory for the people of the Sudan and its leaders  who brought about the triumph of tolerance and wisdom in order to make national reconciliation possible. I should like to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General our appreciation for his efforts on behalf of the United Nations to render assistance to the Government of the Sudan and to help it in rehabilitating the people of the southern region of the country.200.	The state of affairs in the Middle East has remained stagnant since our last session in this same hall  and one might wonder with some concern whether this ""no peace  no war"" situation will persist for a long time to come. On both sides of the cease-fire line  armed enemies in possession of the most advanced and sophisticated forms of human and material destruction are in a state of confrontation. All the efforts of our Organization to persuade the parties to proceed from declarations of intent to the actual negotiation of a true and lasting peace have not yet met with any success. However  in spite of all the difficulties which still persist in bringing about a peaceful settlement of this conflict  we continue to believe that reason will finally triumph on both sides and that external influences will be brought to bear in the direction of safeguarding peace rather than that of maintaining a precarious order dictated by mere material interests. It is to this end that we very much hope that there will be continuation of negotiations under the aegis of the Secretary-General  and we would request all peace-loving nations to give him their support.201.	Our optimism as to the possibility of bringing about a peaceful situation in the world has just found some justification in the direct contacts which have recently taken place last May between South and North Korea. Thus  on its own initiative  Korea has found its own path towards reunification without foreign intervention thanks to the wisdom and determination of its leaders. We take great pleasure at this happy course of events and hope that all the members of the international community will refrain from adopting any position which might jeopardize what has already been achieved and will endeavor to encourage the two parties to persist in their search for a restoration of peace.202.	Another date which will go down in the history of international relations is that of 3 July 1972  on which the leaders of India and Pakistan decided to let bygones be bygones and sat down at the negotiation table at Simla. The Indo-Pakistan agreement on bilateral relations based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter was brought about thanks to the wisdom of the heads of the Governments of the two countries  who thus affirmed their faith in the virtues of dialog for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.203.	The difficult heritage of the past cannot be swept away at a single stroke. But what counts is the will of all parties to hold themselves ready for the discussion of problems that are often quite acute. This will was clearly expressed by the two Governments  and we want from this rostrum to express to them our admiration and our pleasure  as well as our hope that there will be rapid agreement on the fate of the prisoners of war and displaced persons in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Security Council.204.	Our Organization is now at the crossroads. The entry into the United Nations on 25 October 1971 of the most populous nation on earth is in itself a sign that a new era has begun for the great family we form in this Assembly. If we have welcomed that admission as the prelude to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations  we are entitled today to express our gratification at another event that will inevitably have a beneficial effect on the evolution of international relations. The historic visit of the Chief Executive of the United States to the People's Republic of China at the beginning of this year was for the whole world an illustration of the essential truth that differences in ideology are not incompatible with the search for peace and coexistence. It is for that peace and peaceful coexistence that we should be happy one day to see the Chinese of Peking and the Chinese of Taipei sitting around the same table  animated by the same desire to bring about the normalization of a situation which more than 20 years of history have imposed upon China.205.	Still within the framework of detente and international security  the nine-day visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union after a quarter-century of cold war marked a decisive turning-point in the process of detente and disarmament. Indeed  the great success of that visit will be the agreement on the limitation of strategic arms.  Although in practice this agreement constitutes nothing but the freezing of the number of missiles in the nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers  it does permit the hope that discussions with a view to general and complete disarmament will have a favorable outcome.206.	Thanks to the sustained efforts of the international community  many agreements have now been reached in the field of the limitation of arms and  indeed  in the field of the prohibition of nuclear tests. We would with the Secretary-General express the hope that those efforts will go on and rapidly bring about the necessary political decision for the final conclusion of an agreement on the total prohibition of nuclear tests.207.	An opinion often expressed from this rostrum as also in the course of many international conferences is that total disarmament would be the surest guarantee of international peace and security. We should like to reaffirm that  and to make it clear that the allocation of the tremendous resources devoted to the manufacture of military devices to the needs of the third world would be the noblest and most effective form for the international co-operation humanity requires in order to assuage substantially the poverty and tribulations of the ""have-nots"" in both the developed and the developing countries.208.	In the economic and social field  all efforts converge towards the search for balance  and all nations are trying to overcome the numerous difficulties they face by incessantly increasing co-operation and assistance.209.	In spite of all these efforts the United Nations still remains powerless to solve the great problems of development faced by the third world.210.	In the realm of trade  the efforts of certain industrialized countries to apply an appropriate policy of access to their markets in order to increase the export earnings of the developing countries are certainly substantial. But the process is slow  and the products concerned often represent only a small proportion of total exports  particularly so far as concerns processed products. That is why my country notes with infinite regret the failure of all attempts to find appropriate solutions to the principal problems raised at various international meetings.211.	Thus^ at the third session of UNCTAD  held at Santiago  Chile  with regard to the primary problems  the search for solutions which might have given rise to some hope for the third world came up against the opposition of the rich countries  whose concern to avoid undertaking commitments of a general kind became even clearer than it had been at previous conferences. In fact  everyone preferred to make use in his zone of influence of concessions as instruments of pressure. It is  incidentally  remarkable that in actual practice in the last decade the elements of inequality and domination in relations between rich and poor countries have been intensified. Consequently  the least we can ask of the affluent countries is that they refrain from aggravating a situation that is already extremely alarming. Furthermore  we think it is urgent for general agreement to be reached on the stabilization and improvement of commodity prices.212.	Furthermore  the present monetary situation has aggravated the deterioration in terms of trade and the various readjustments made necessary by the situation have even further increased the indebtedness of the developing countries. Our Organization should without further delay contemplate compensatory measures for the countries of the third world and associate them with all negotiations on reforming the international monetary system in the light of the influence any reform will inevitably have upon the economies of the developing countries.213.	As far as concerns assistance  the objective of the International Development Strategy is  as we know  that of bringing to at least 6 per cent the average annual rate of growth of the gross national product of developing countries. We are therefore entitled to hope that the new Decade will see a qualitative increase in assistance from the rich to the poor countries. Unfortunately  in this regard it is regrettable that the means advocated by the third world in Santiago have not won the total support of the donor countries.214.	For its development  the third world fundamentally needs capital  as also technical expertise and the practical abilities necessary to use such expertise. The success of this development requires that the transfer of this capital and technology take place without overwhelming the recipient countries by exorbitant repayment schedules and without placing them in a situation that prevents them from controlling their own economic priorities and their own social structures.215.	In spite of the great concern aroused by the conduct of the affluent countries in the face of the problems of development confronting the third world  my Government appreciates the resolutions adopted in Santiago in favor of the least advanced countries and hopes that the special measures to be taken will rapidly be made effective in order to reduce the enormous lag of those countries.216.	From all the speeches that have been made from this rostrum there emerges the unanimous and constant will of all States to live in peace  to rid themselves of the threats facing humanity  and to ensure coming generations of a better future  a future of greater justice and dignity. We are convinced that the United Nations can and must be the instrument of our actions if we want to meet those aspirations. We issue an urgent appeal to countries large and small to strengthen the means available to our Organization With a view to permitting it rapidly to triumph over its difficulties and meet the hopes reposed in it by all the peoples. Let us join our efforts to make of the United Nations a real  effective source of solutions to conflicts and of the improvement of the standards of living of hundreds of millions of human beings who still live in need and poverty  because the objectives of peace must be based  to quote Seneca  ""on a common mode of existence  on a way of living for others  if we really want to live for ourselves"".217.	Let us together  then  solemnly undertake to translate into fact those wise words of Seneca so that the Second United Nations Development Decade can be the decade of peace and a better future for everyone."
"10",564,"BFA",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is a pleasant duty for me to congratulate you on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Upper Volta on your brilliant election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You are eminently qualified for the post. There is no doubt that  thanks to the wisdom and experience for which you are known  the work of the present session will be crowned with success. I would assure you that  in the accomplishment of the delicate task that has been entrusted to you  you may fully reply upon the collaboration of my delegation.18.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  who as President of the twenty-sixth session gave us the benefit of his wisdom and rich experience.19.	I would also address the warmest congratulations of my Government to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has taken office in an unstable world in which violence and injustice and the disparity in development between States constitute the most urgent threats to the future of our civilization. The United Nations needs men who have faith in it  and Mr. Kurt Waldheim is such a man  as was his predecessor  U Thant  to whom I wish to pay a tribute for his great work as Secretary-General of this Organization for a whole decade.20.	May I likewise on behalf of my delegation pay a tribute to the memory of the late Paul-Henri Spaak  who was President of the first session of the General Assembly. He was a great statesman who unceasingly proclaimed his faith in the United Nations.21.	In considering the agenda of the present session  what surprises and astonishes us most is the presence indeed  L might say the permanent presence of a large number of items that have already been examined by this Assembly at a number of previous sessions. This state of affairs rapidly leads us to pessimism and to doubt  because what can one truly feel if not a sense of failure in the face of the paucity of practical results obtained by the United Nations over the past few years in its fundamental task of maintaining international peace and security? The trouble-spots that subsist or break out  the injustices born of colonial domination or racial discrimination  the feeling of frustration of peoples who have the painful impression that they have been left out because of the wastage brought about by war  military domination and the arms race these are the melancholy realities that lead us to pessimism.22.	Upper Volta and a large number of small and medium-sized countries are and always will be available to turn the United Nations into an institution in the service of peace  justice  progress and the freedom of peoples. The experience of the past few years has shown that it is these small countries which the great Powers often for uncharitable or dubious purposes like to designate by the term ""irresponsible majority"". It is these small and medium-sized Powers that are the sap of the United Nations. In them can be found the faith and enthusiasm that presided over the birth of our Organization.23.	If today the United Nations has in various circumstances given the impression of an ineffective  even passive  organism  it is because after a quarter of a century of participation in the Organization that enthusiasm has worn off some of its Members  which may be understandable. But what the small Powers such as Upper Volta have difficulty in understanding and accepting is that great Powers are trying to divert the United Nations from its true vocation to the exclusive defense of their own interests.24.	This state of affairs does not  of course  lead us to question the importance or utility of the United Nations  because  apart from the forum it represents for the examination of the problems of our times  this Organization remains invested with a historic responsibility based upon the need to build a world where fruitful relations between human beings and Governments depend on peace  tho recognition of fundamental human rights  the freedom of peoples still under colonial domination  and a constant quest for economic and social progress. Of course  the obstacles blocking the attainment of that noble purpose are numerous and sometimes unforeseeable. The composition of this Assembly  which reflects a complex world  is not the least of these.25.	At this session this Assembly will see the confrontation of ideologies and interests. Unanimity will be difficult to achieve on a large number of questions. Nevertheless let us have the courage to rise above ourselves. Let us see to it that the United Nations does not become a synonym for failure  as was the defunct League of Nations. The Charter is an appeal addressed to all the peoples of the world  asking them to work together in order to build peace and international security.26.	We must acknowledge that at the beginning of this session an analysis of the facts does not allow us to show any optimism. Indeed  throughout the world tragedies are being played out  sowing suffering  mourning and ruin among innocent populations. By an irony of fate violence and injustice take place in the poorest continents.27.	What  then  can one say concerning the persistence of colonial situations in Africa? The General Assembly and the Security Council have had to consider colonialism in Africa for a number of years. Numerous resolutions  and in particular resolution 1514 (XV)  on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  have been adopted without the proponents of colonialism yielding on any point. They have refused to abandon positions they have inherited from past systematic exploitation of the African continent. The international order the United Nations defends should not accept this situation. Everything should be set in motion by the world community to eradicate any domination in Africa and elsewhere.28.	In referring to colonialism  it is especially to Portugal that we turn once again. Portugal's will to maintain itself through repression in Angola and Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) makes no sense whatever today. It is erroneous and Utopian for Portugal to believe that it will withstand the struggle for national liberation on which the populations of these countries have embarked.29.	What we find most distressing is that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which on numerous occasions have proved their devotion to the sacred principle of the freedom of peoples provide considerable assistance to Portugal  thus making it possible for it to pursue its colonial war.30.	It seems to me that the time has come for Portugal to enter into a healthy discussion with those who have risen in order to recover their freedom and dignity  so as to find solutions to problems which weapons have thus far been unable to solve.31.	To the States which grant their support to Portugal  we say that they are wrong to do so  because this people is clinging to a lost cause: moribund colonialism. From the United Nations  over and above the resolutions  we now ask for concrete action in favor of the liberation movements in colonized Africa because these are proceeding from victory to victory and control vast expanses of their territory which had been under foreign domination.32.	For our part  we affirm once again that we shall not cease to work for the total liberation of the African continent from the colonial yoke  both in the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ and as well as in this Assembly.33.	Now  I come to southern Africa: colonialism and racism constitute a threat to international peace and security in that region.34.	In Rhodesia we were going to say in Zimbabwe-it is almost seven years since Ian Smith and his band defied the international community and the United Kingdom by deliberately choosing illegality. In the face of the unfortunate ineffectiveness of the international action  still being undertaken by the United Kingdom  the white racists of Rhodesia are gradually giving hatred and racial separation the status of a system  aided in this by South Africa and Portugal. The black population of Rhodesia has clearly manifested its rejection of white domination by turning down the Anglo-Rhodesian ""proposals for a settlement"" of November 1971.  In view of the impasses  the honorable solution for the United Kingdom and for all concerned would consist in convening as soon as possible a national constitutional conference with the participation of the authentic political representatives of the Rhodesian people to resolve together the problems of Rhodesia. As for the international community  it can make a positive contribution to the restoration of legality and justice in Rhodesia by stringently applying the sanctions decided upon by the Security Council; we are aware that unfortunately this is not the case  inasmuch as results show that the sanctions decided on by the Council as far back as June 1968 in its resolution 253 (1968) have been a failure and have thus far been unable to bring down the Ian Smith regime. My country regrets that a super-Power-the United States of America a permanent member of the Security Council  is setting a bad example by purchasing chrome from Rhodesia.35.	In the case of Namibia  a mission was entrusted to the Secretary-General by the Security Council in its resolution 309 (1972) adopted at its meetings in Addis Ababa in February. That mission has now been extended. My country is not accustomed to passing a priori judgment upon the efforts of the Security Council concerning any given situation. Nevertheless  the known facts  in particular the conduct of the policy which is that of the ""national homes""  cannot prevent us from having doubts concerning the real desire of South Africa to co-operate with the United Nations.36.	It goes without saying that  independently of the present mission of the Secretary-General-which is one attempt among so many others-the international community must continue and intensify its efforts to help  by appropriate means  the Namibian people to reach independence in unity and in territorial integrity.37.	In South Africa still  human rights continue to be flouted through a system that has been universally condemned  and I am referring to apartheid. That doctrine of white supremacy is absurd and we shall condemn it ceaselessly. It is unthinkable that in the midst of the twentieth century individuals should invoke racial supremacy in order to oppress others. Recent history has shown the grave dangers for the peace and the future of mankind inherent in such doctrines. International opinion has condemned apartheid This Assembly has declared that that system is a crime against humanity. The racist authorities of Pretoria have embarked upon a vast campaign of propaganda in order to rid themselves of their guilt in the face of this unanimous condemnation. The failure of that campaign proves that the policy of racial discrimination practiced by South Africa is indefensible. The responsibilities vested in this Organization require of all its Members a responsible attitude towards the problem of apartheid; in other words  the acquiescence  nay  the complicity of certain great Powers members of the Security Council with respect to South Africa give the peoples of Africa grounds for concern.38.	Lately  however  there have been some encouraging events in the world. First of all  within this very Organization  the presence of the People's Republic of China is a major step towards the universality prescribed by the Charter. TTiis event is demonstrably a prime mover in the international detente of which the visit of President Nixon to Peking is an example. In Asia we were pleased to note the historic decision taken by the two Koreas in order to bring about the peaceful and independent unification of that country divided  as it has been  for almost a quarter of a century.39.	Furthermore  in Europe the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and between the Federal Republic and Poland  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  pending the conference on European security  are also so many additional elements of international detente. But we cannot overlook the fact that the clash between the ideologies and the ambitions of States in that region led to two world wars  and we must say how encouraged we are by the new atmosphere of detente and co-operation which is emerging there.40.	If all peace-loving nations have seen a glimmer of hope in these events  there are still serious problems facing the international community.41.	In addition to incomplete decolonization  we now have centers of tension and crises  all of which represent particularly dangerous situations throughout the world. For five years the Middle East has attracted the attention of world public opinion. For five years we have heard mention of the peaceful solution; and yet  thus far  no solution for peace has been found. We must state again that it is not realistic to challenge the existence of a State  regardless of which it is  in that region; furthermore the acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible and must be condemned. However  the more time passes  the more difficult the problem becomes to solve; peace must be achieved as soon as possible. Thus  we have always been convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is still a sound basis for the settlement of the conflict. We at the OAU have also tried to make our modest contribution to the implementation of that resolution. Unfortunately  the Committee of African Heads of State  the 10 wise men of Africa  encountered the same obstacles as the Jarring mission  namely  the refusal by one of the parties to accept the terms of resolution 242 (1967).42.	In South-East Asia  the same tragedy is being played out. The populations of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos are at one and the same time the protagonists and the victims of a tragedy which is beyond their control.43.	We are particularly conscious of Viet-Nam  where an entire generation has known nothing but war and all the miseries in its train. The road to peace is still long  but we must admit that any solution to Viet-Nam must rest on the choice by the people of Viet-Nam of the political system that they desire without foreign pressure or interference.44.	The Indian subcontinent was shaken a year ago by a fratricidal war; it is encouraging to see now that peace has been restored in that region. We pay a tribute to the wisdom of the parties to that conflict which allowed the Simla Agreement of 3 July to be concluded.45.	The building and strengthening of international peace and security are closely linked to the achievement of progress towards general and complete disarmament.46.	This Assembly last year took up eight points relating to disarmament  and that is a good indication of our concern over this problem. But we must admit that a certain discouragement and lassitude has taken over our minds in the light of the meager practical results obtained in the conferences  documents and statements made. In the meantime  the two super-Powers and I am thinking here of the United States and the Soviet Union continued quantitatively and qualitatively to develop and improve formidable weapons  and the smaller countries are perfectly justified in wondering fearfully to what ends these weapons will be put. Hence we welcomed with relief the Agreement for a limitation of the strategic arms race  arrived at in Moscow in May 1972 between the two super-Powers.  We should like to believe that that Agreement is the first step in a deescalation that will banish once and for all the prospects of a nuclear war. We would also hope that the two great Powers will not rest on their laurels but will continue to ponder the question of disarmament because as we hardly need to remind you the survival of our civilization is at stake.47.	The survival of our civilization is not only threatened by the arms race but also and perhaps even more so by disparities in economic development. In this field  the responsibility for the effort to be be made lies first and foremost with the developing countries. Unfortunately  in many sectors this effort is checked by foreign forces which are entirely outside the control of the developing countries. The success of the International Development Strategy lies in the capacity of the poor nations to control these external forces  and the aim of international co-operation is to assist them to achieve that control. We appeal particularly to the wealthy countries  which represent 25 per cent of the world's population but which own 80 per cent of its wealth  to become aware of the role they have to play in the economic future of the developing countries. In this respect  the third session of UNCTAD  held at Santiago in April and May  is the best yardstick for measuring the evolution which has taken place since the second session at New Delhi in 1968. With some chagrin we are forced to recognize that the economic and trade system of the world is far from having undergone the qualitative changes indispensable to the establishment of a new system which would be more equitable towards the third world  and is thus less likely to assist their efforts towards economic and social development. The third session at Santiago has indeed showed that in trade matters the intention was to reject out of hand the requests of the developing countries for a total liberation of exchanges in their favor  for a share in the market for commodities competing with those of the developed countries and for a price policy through international agreements.48.	The developed countries preferred to refer all these matters to the trade negotiations to be held in 1973 within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]  whereas the experience of the Kennedy Round has clearly shown that at that level the main action consists of mutual concessions between the wealthy countries to the detriment of the interests of the third world.49.	Upper Volta remains convinced that as long as an appropriate solution is not found to these questions within UNCTAD  the international community  in particular the developing countries  has no chance of achieving the targets set in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  because  in fact  the developed countries would continue to take back through trade more than they give through technical and financial assistance and the imbalance of the operation will remain in their favor.50.	To illustrate this bad faith  we only have to mention the lack of agreement on coffee  the uncertainties about a sugar agreement and so on. In this connexion Upper Volta  like its neighboring countries  was disagreeably surprised one morning in August to note that we had been forced to purchase a kilo of sugar at 110 CFA francs as opposed to 80 CFA francs  which had been the price the day before. Our countries are therefore nothing but pawns in the hands of the financial magnates  and the indignant populations are powerless to stop this exploitation. Such plunder must cease  at all costs.51.	On the financial level  the participation of the third world in seeking solutions to the present monetary crisis seems to be an accepted principle; we are gratified at the recognition albeit a tardy one-of the need to give the third world a voice in negotiations on a problem which affects it just as much  if not more  than it affects the wealthy countries.52.	With regard to the supply of public and private resources for development  the developing countries have expressed their disquiet at the net reduction of the total volume of capital flow and the failure to reach the target of 1 per cent set by the Strategy. There have been very few actions aimed at improving terms for the granting of aid and  in particular  for ""untying"" aid.53.	Furthermore  the cost of debt servicing has increased very rapidly  thereby decreasing the importing capacity of the developing countries. Upper Volta hopes that UNCTAD will set up an organization to investigate ways and means of lightening the debt load of the developing countries.54.	The connexion between special drawing rights and supplementary financing of development has yet to be determined  and the reason for this is the lack of goodwill of the wealthy countries.55.	Concerning the special measures to assist the least developed countries and the additional measures to assist land-locked countries  I think some gratification can be expressed on the results achieved. However  that is but a document that is worth only the value the signatories place on it. In other words  the measures envisaged to assist the less advanced countries have to be implemented for the international community to decide whether it can state objectively that this was one of the rare successes of the meetings at Santiago.56.	We do not need to reiterate our position on the different aspects of these special measures. We have already done so in many forums these past years. The international community in general  and the developed countries and the international institutions in particular have before them a document which is the result of mutual concessions and which is accepted by all. It is now a question of translating these declarations of intention and the acceptance of the resolution into specific and immediate actions.57.	Thus  if after more than 25 years  the United Nations can claim credit for a large number of achievements  this Organization still has serious shortcomings: the persistence of colonial regimes  the bastions of racial discrimination  the fact that many crises are kept out of the United Nations or solved outside it  inequality in economic and social development of peoples-all show that the United Nations have not always or not yet lived up to our hopes. In this connexion we do not believe it fair to blame the Charter and to connect the ineffectiveness of the United Nations with its review. No human undertaking is perfect  and the Charter cannot be an exception to this principle.58.	What stands in the way of our Organization acting in a dynamic and effective way is the lack of will on the part of certain Member States to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly  the Security Council and other organs.59.	Upper Volta believes in peace and in the need for international security and we should like to reiterate our confidence in the immense possibilities of this Organization through the concerted action of all its Members. It is true that today the general interest continues more often than not to be subordinated to selfish interests. But we have the duty to rise above all this and to be worthy of the mission which the peoples of the world have entrusted to us  namely  to work towards the achievement of an era of peace  justice and equality among men."
"11",653,"BGR",27,1972,"Comrade President  in making my first speech from this rostrum  I should like first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and on my own behalf  to extend cordial congratulations to you on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you success in carrying out your noble task  and I am certain that under your guidance the present session of the General Assembly will take new  concrete steps towards the affirmation and practical attainment of peaceful  constructive relations between peoples a goal towards which Poland has made its contribution together with the other socialist countries.84.	I should also like to welcome the Secretary-General  Kurt Waldheim  and to take this opportunity at the opening	at the twenty-seventh session  the first session since his	I election to that high post  to wish him success in his demanding work.85.	At a time when the most authoritative representatives of States Members of the United Nations have an opportunity to speak from this rostrum and to set out the position of their Governments on the principal problems of the present day  we should like to state that we join a number of previous speakers in noting with satisfaction that the process of detente is one of the most significant and encouraging factors of the present moment in history. For that reason  we associate ourselves with all those who laid stress on the favorable trends in international life that have appeared since the end of the twenty-sixth session.86.	Indeed  we have witnessed events which only a year I ago appeared far off and improbable. Exceptionally important agreements came into force within a brief period during the current year  summit meetings were held between the leaders of great Powers  and historic treaties were signed. Of course  these events cannot be regarded as s accidental or coincidental. We are deeply convinced and I should like to stress this-that what is involved is a natural development  the result of the growth of the forces of peace and their unyielding struggle for detente and the strengthening of peace and international security.87.	In noting the importance of the favorable developments which have occurred during the year  one cannot but	I stress their link with the consistent and active foreign	policies of the socialist countries  particularly the Soviet Union  which has for 50 years been pursuing an unwavering	 policy of peace  mutual understanding and co-operation. It was because of that policy that such useful steps were taken as the coming into force of the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the Treaty of 7 December 1970 between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany  the Quadripartite Agreement  of 3 September 1971  on West Berlin and the agreements concluded on 8 December 1971 by the German Democratic Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany and with the West Berlin Senate. This put an end to an extremely serious problem which had been troublinginternational relations in Europe for many years.88.	There can no doubt that the talks held in Moscow  the Basic Principles of Mutual Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States signed in the Soviet capital on 29 May 1972  and the concrete agreements reached in the field of strategic arms control  are also beneficial to the cause of strengthening peace. 89.	Another encouraging factor has been the contacts initiated in a key area of the Far East  where the possibility has arisen of achieving direct mutual understanding between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea. An important agreement on bilateral relations has been reached between India and Pakistan  and this is a step forward towards the establishment of a lasting peace on the Hindustan peninsula.90.	All these events bear witness to an increasingly pronounced trend in international life towards the establishment of new relationships between States and an improved outlook for the peaceful settlement of longstanding disputes  without the use or the threat of force. There are thus encouraging prospects for new efforts to achieve a further detente  to prevent a revival of the cold war  to eliminate existing hotbeds of conflicts and to strengthen international security and peace throughout the world.91.	In this positive process  great importance naturally attaches to the question of convening a European conference on security and co-operation  which would be an extremely significant contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and international security. I believe that today no one can deny that the socialist countries' initiative evoked a wide and favorable public response not only in Europe but throughout the world. This initiative revitalized the political activities of European States  produced numerous contacts and useful exchanges of views between statesmen  and facilitated and accelerated the development of various types of closer co-operation in all spheres of public life.92.	There is no question that the achievements of this year have established the necessary objective preconditions for the convening of the conference  which is now an urgent matter facing the peoples of Europe. It is essential to take advantage of the favorable political climate prevailing on the ancient continent in order to hasten and strengthen this process of clearing the air.93.	In addition to the need to convene a European conference on security and co-operation  there are pressing issues like the normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  including recognition that the Munich Agreement was invalid ab initio  and the admission of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations. There is no question that the settlement of these issues would give new and powerful impetus to an even more rapid improvement of the political climate on the continent and throughout the world.94.	The admission of the two German States to the United Nations is undeniably one of the most urgent steps that could be taken to strengthen security in Europe  and it would be in the interests of all European States and the entire world community. This would be a significant contribution to the cause of strengthening the United Nations itself by reinforcing one of the basic principles of the Charter  the principle of universality.95.	The argument that a settlement of this question is dependent on the establishment of normal bilateral relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany does not stand up under examination. It runs counter to the logic of present developments in Europe. The immediate admission of the two German States to the United Nations would provide a decisive stimulus to the establishment of a climate of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborliness between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and would contribute to a solution of the problems which are impeding the establishment of normal relations between them.96.	As a representative of a socialist country whose foreign policy has at all times been inspired by the principles of peaceful coexistence  I should like to deal specifically with the favorable development of the situation in the Balkans. For almost three decades  the Bulgarian Government has been making every effort to support  develop and strengthen friendly and good-neighborly ties with the Balkan countries and to contribute to an improvement in the political climate in that area. I should like to express my satisfaction at the fact that our country's efforts are appreciated and welcomed by other Balkan States. The favorable signs and tendencies pointing towards mutual understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation between the States of the Balkan peninsula are becoming a permanent  encouraging trend which all Balkan peoples have an interest in furthering.97.	In its attitude towards the favorable results of the visits  meetings and contacts which have taken place between high-ranking representatives of the Balkan countries and which have provided opportunities for the discussion of problems of mutual interest as the President of the State Council  Todor Zhivkov  has emphasized several times the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to be inspired by the same unchangeable principles and will  as before  be ready at all times to follow this path  to contribute actively to a further affirmation and strengthening of the spirit of mutual understanding and trust in the Balkans.98.	However  I cannot but express here my concern at the attempts of certain circles in the West to provoke and promote tension in areas in close proximity to the Balkan peninsula. Their purpose is to disturb the tranquil atmosphere which the peoples of the Balkans are so anxious to maintain and improve.99.	The main problem and  if I may be permitted to say so  the object of universal concern in the thoughts and feelings of peoples is the question of strengthening international security and maintaining peace. There is no need to point out how real and justified are people's fears of a new international conflagration and its disastrous consequences. It is an elementary truth that only in conditions of lasting peace and security can the extremely complex problems facing mankind be solved.100.	That is why the international community gives priority to questions connected with the strengthening of peace and security. It is also the reason for its sensitivity to anything that directly or indirectly relates to security. Clear proof of this can be seen in decisions adopted at the last two sessions of the General Assembly the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] and the resolution concerning its implementation [resolution 2880 (XXVI)].101.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is profoundly convinced that the problems of international security are of central importance in the work of the present session. The United Nations  which was created in order to watch tirelessly over world peace  does not and cannot have any greater task than that. The States Members of this Organization must and given a spirit of goodwill- can breathe life into these extremely important documents.102.	The twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is called upon to make a valuable contribution to the effort to strengthen international security and prevent military conflicts by making progress  in particular  towards solving the most important problem of all that of the non-use of force and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. The new Soviet proposal on the ""non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [A/L.676] is therefore a timely and extremely important initiative. In calling upon all States to renounce the use of force by any means of warfare  the Soviet Government is affirming one of the most important and fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. Moreover  renunciation of the use of force is inseparably bound up with the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons  the most powerful means of mass destruction.103.	The draft resolution submitted by the Soviet delegation is a concrete and timely step towards the practical implementation of this proposal. The Bulgarian delegation firmly and whole-heartedly supports it and believes that its consideration and adoption by the General Assembly would open the way to giving its provisions binding force in accordance with Article 25 of the United Nations Charter and would promote the further strengthening of international security.104.	At the same time  this should not be construed as an infringement of the right of any nation to Individual or collective self-defense or as a renunciation of the use of force against aggression in the struggle of oppressed peoples for national independence or self-determination. Moreover  a positive solution of this problem would give new impetus to the recent trend towards reducing international tension and limiting the arms race.105.	The logic of international developments creates a direct  indissoluble link between the problems of disarmament and the entire complex of problems relating to security.106.	The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has always supported and continues to support all useful initiatives in the field of disarmament. By taking part in the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament meeting at Geneva  it is making its contribution to the adoption of a number of concrete decisions and draft treaties and conventions. From our own experience  we know well the difficulties and obstacles which stand in the way of such decisions. For that reason  we cannot agree with those who under-estimate the agreements that have already been achieved. The Bulgarian delegation takes the view that new impetus should be given to the disarmament negotiations and that it is essential to take advantage of every opportunity to join efforts in promoting the widest possible international discussion of this crucial question.107.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the broad program for disarmament negotiations proposed by the Government of the Soviet Union in April 1971 as well as the Soviet proposal at the twenty-sixth session for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference [A/8491] at which this question so vitally important for mankind-would for the first time receive the most thorough consideration in all its aspects with a view to achieving the great ultimate goal: general and complete disarmament under strict international control. In its reply to the Secretary-General's letter on this [see A/8817  annex]  the Bulgarian Government urges the immediate establishment of an appropriate preparatory organ for the World Disarmament Conference so that the Conference will be convened in the near future-in 1973  or at all events not later than 1974.108.	As we are all aware  events have occurred in recent months which bespeak a desire to improve the international situation in other parts of the world. I refer to new developments on the Korean peninsula  which are reflected in the joint communique issued by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea on 4 july 1972 [A/8727  annex I]. This positive development shows that the socialist countries are correct and justified in the urgent demand they have made in the United Nations General Assembly by the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea and the withdrawal of United States troops from the peninsula in order to enable the people of Korea to solve their problems themselves [A/8752/Add.9]. It also shows that the resolutions adopted in the past on the question of Korea do not reflect the desires of the people of Korea and are a major obstacle to the establishment of contacts between the two parts of the country. Today  the real issue is that of eliminating outside interference. The United Nations should assist the people of Korea in realizing its clearly expressed desire to decide its own fate. One can only deplore the fact that  through the efforts of those same forces which for many years have been obstructing the peaceful unification of Korea  consideration of the question of removing the principal obstacles to the reunification of the country has once again been deferred this year.109.	The agreement on bilateral relations signed by India and Pakistan is an important step towards establishing normal relations and laying the foundations for a lasting peace and good-neighborliness on the Hindustan peninsula. This sound policy being pursued by two major Asian States is a significant contribution to the task of improving the political climate in southern Asia.110.	The admission of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations would further help to promote the process of establishing a genuinely peaceful atmosphere in that part of the world and would also be an affirmation of the principle of United Nations universality. Like any sovereign State  Bangladesh meets all the requirements for membership in the world organization  and no one has any basis for disputing its right to become a Member. The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is convinced that the United Nations General Assembly will take the only correct decision and support Bangladesh's request for admission to the United Nations [A/8754].111.	Being concerned about the maintenance of peace and bearing responsibility for it  States Members of the Organization cannot and do not have the right to remain silent about the most acute and most urgent crises and conflicts of our time.112.	The war in Viet-Nam is continuing  with use being made of everything that modern military technology has to offer. The annihilation of the peaceful  defenseless population is arousing righteous indignation and outrage throughout the world. The interventionists are attempting to do what is clearly impossible to destroy the will and the unparalleled courage of the heroic people of Viet-Nam.113.	The Bulgarian people  who have always maintained solidarity with the just struggle of Viet-Nam and the other peoples of IndoChina  support the demand for the unconditional cessation of the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the blockade of its ports  as well as the demand for the withdrawal of all United States armed forces from that area in order to permit the peoples of IndoChina to determine their own fate. After 10 years of military operations  it has become quite clear that the war will be ended not through escalation but only through negotiations on the basis of the proposals put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam.114.	Another constant source of alarm and anxiety in the world is the situation in the Middle East. As events of the last few weeks have shown  a storm can blow up there at any time  producing a dangerous crisis with unforeseeable consequences. The United Nations has been involved in the search for a just and peaceful solution of the problem  and the anxiety with which the matter has been viewed here over a period of many years is justified. A huge majority of States Members of the United Nations are rightly insisting that Israel should accept full responsibility for the increasing tension which now exists. By their refusal to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and their entire policy of expansion  aggression and disregard for the rules of international law  the Israeli leaders are frustrating the efforts of this international organization  undermining its authority and sabotaging the mission of the Secretary-General's representative  Ambassador jarring.115.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always insisted that Israel should desist from its dangerous policy of provocation in this highly tense area and that  in order to facilitate Ambassador Jarring's task  Israel should finally begin to implement Security Council resolution 242(1967). We believe that the present General Assembly session will once again demonstrate to Israel that it cannot expect to obtain  and will not obtain  foreign territory as a reward for committing aggression and flouting the Charter and the authority of the United Nations.116.	We unreservedly support the efforts of the Arab States to eliminate the consequences of Israeli aggression and the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for the restoration of their rights. At the same time  we repudiate the terrorist acts committed by certain elements in the resistance movement. Such desperate and reckless acts as the incident in Munich harm chiefly the cause of the Palestinian people and are used by Israel in the interests of its aggressive Zionist policies.117.	A number of important questions are on the agenda of the current session. My delegation regards all of them as very significant and will set forth its position in the appropriate Committees. However  I should like to state from this rostrum that we oppose today  as we have in the past  all attempts of any kind to revise the United Nations Charter. I wish to emphasize again that the reason for the shortcomings of this international Organization should be sought not in the Organization itself but in the policies of those countries which  now as in the past  are not observing the United Nations Charter and are violating its fundamental principles.118.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches great importance to the question of preparing a convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting. This question has immediate relevance and deserves to be considered in a properly serious and careful manner.119.	The United Nations is also confronted with the task of resolving a number of important questions relating to economic co-operation  including the problem of accelerating the economic development of the recently liberated peoples.120.	We believe that in the struggle for a new and just international division of labor which will take account of the interests of all States and ensure favorable conditions for rapid economic development  the United Nations should play an important role and take a firm position on the side of the developing countries.121.	We are profoundly convinced that the United Nations is also .called upon to play a historic role in carrying out the program of action for the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  including  first and foremost  its application to the peoples of Guinea (Bissau)  Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe and Namibia in their struggle for the final elimination of the criminal policy of apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination.122.	The position of the People's Republic of Bulgaria on all these questions has been set forth on more than one occasion in the appropriate organs of the United Nations and is well known.123.	In concluding my statement  I should like to express my delegation's conviction that the current session  in giving serious and thorough consideration to the items on the agenda  will take into account the important present stage in the development of international relations and will give new impetus to the trend towards acceleration of the process of detente and the strengthening of international security. In doing so  the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly will help to ensure that the positive factors in contemporary political life tip the scales of history and that mankind advances even closer to the realization of its great objective: the establishment of lasting peace and security throughout the world."
"12",698,"BHR",27,1972,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the Government of Bahrain  heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. I feel confident that you will guide our proceedings in a manner that will enable us to solve the difficult problems that face us at this session.2.	May I extend my thanks  too  to our outgoing President for his patient and wise conduct of the work of the last session  without which our task today would have been more difficult.3.	I should also like to thank our Secretary-General for the zeal and vigilance he has shown in carrying out his duties during the short time that he has been in office  and for the valuable and informative report he has submitted to us on the work of the Organization [A/8701 and Add].4.	Since Bahrain's admission to the United Nations during the last session  my country has pursued with interest and satisfaction the many useful activities of the Organization and its various organs and bodies in the economic  social  cultural  humanitarian  health and other fields. The advances made by the Organization in harmonizing international co-operation in these various fields through the dispatch of missions  the opening of regional offices or the convening of conferences have facilitated the study of world problems and the communication of technical knowledge and assistance to those who need it most in the developing world. The assistance and succor given to refugees and victims of racial  colonial or military aggression have reflected the awakening conscience of peace- loving nations and their desire to stamp out from world society the evils of racism  opportunism and exploitation.5.	One of the outstanding achievements of the Organization this year was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which was held in Stockholm. My Government attaches great importance to the recommendations of that Conference  which  we hope  will gain wide support.6.	The outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  held at Santiago in April and May 1972  gave rise to disillusionment and disappointment in the ranks of the developing countries  which had hoped that the developed countries would agree to the implementation of convergent measures that would bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. It is a sad fact of international life that millions continue to live below the minimum levels required for decent human existence. The problems of the least developed among the developing countries have become so urgent that they require immediate and effective remedies. Other  advanced  countries must co-operate to make the concept of international development a reality so that the United Nations may fulfill its promise of ensuring a better world for all peoples.7.	The General Assembly has included in its agenda an item on measures to prevent international terrorism  including a study of the underlying causes of acts of violence  which are rooted in misery  frustration  grievance and despair [item 92]. This is indeed an important item because  in a sense  it reflects the failure of the United Nations to implement its own resolutions and mete out justice for all. In the United Nations there is still a wide gap between words and deeds  between decisions and enforcement measures  between ideals and reality. It behoves the United Nations  while debating this item  to examine its own record and draw a moral from its own shortcomings. It is not my intention to condone terrorism or acts of violence  which are alien to our history  civilization and culture. But while studying the underlying causes  we should avoid applying double standards and we should not allow this item to be used as a means of undermining liberation movements  challenging basic human rights  or exonerating from blame those States which  by their disregard of political and human rights  have driven some people to despair.A/PV.20478.	Israel  for instance  expelled the people of Palestine from their homeland and seized all their land and worthy belongings. It also occupies the territories of three Arab States and commits periodic attacks on Arab countries  during which atrocities are committed against civilian populations and innocent people. Who should be condemned: the perpetrator of those acts or the victim  who may sometimes react by imitating the methods that have been used against his own people.9.	Some may say that the United Nations lacks the physical power to take enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. It is common knowledge that the Charter envisaged the creation of a world force  and such force would have been established but for the disagreement among the great Powers. But if physical measures are wanting  do we lack other moral and material forces to implement our decisions and ward off any threat to international peace and security? We honestly believe that the United Nations can marshal enough moral and material force to coerce the aggressor and oppressor to return to reason and to abide by the common will of the international community. How can we say that we have done everything we can  when we see in the Middle East that one party namely  Israel has been excessively armed to wage short and aggressive wars against neighboring countries which are Members of the United Nations. It has occupied parts of three Arab countries and replaced the lawful occupants by hastily drawn immigrants from abroad  contrary to the decisions of the United Nations and to the very letter of Article 2  paragraph 4  of the Charter. All appeals to the aggressor to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations calling upon it to vacate land illegally occupied and to restore the lawful rights of the dispossessed Arab people of Palestine and extend to them proper humanitarian treatment have been continuously ignored and rejected.10.	Would I be asking much if I requested us to call upon those Powers that unceasingly supply strategic and offensive weapons to the aggressive forces of Israel to help them fulfill their expansionist policies and kill innocent women and children  among their other victims  to reconsider their policy and desist  for the sake of peace and humanity? Or would it be much to request  further  that the United Nations use all available means  including sanctions  as provided for in the Charter to put pressure upon the aggressor to comply with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and all other resolutions of the United Nations pertaining to the restoration of the rights of the people of Palestine.11.	I think I should ask for your forbearance and indulgence if I happened to have dwelt a little too long on a problem which is of the utmost importance to my country. This does not mean that I am unconcerned with other problems and questions facing us and the world at large. We live on this small planet as one family of nations  and any act of injustice or oppression committed in any part of the world is of concern to us all and should call for our collective action to redress the wrong and suppress the oppressor.12.	Bahrain  therefore  condemns all policies of racism  discrimination and apartheid followed by the Government of South Africa and other sectarian and authoritarian regimes  and gives its whole-hearted support to all measures taken to alleviate the sufferings of the victims of such policies and their eventual liberation from their oppression.13.	We also support all measures taken or to be taken to liberate people who still live under colonial regimes and to assist them to obtain their freedom and exercise their right to self-determination  in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.14.	In pursuit of its policy of peace and prosperity for all nations  the State of Bahrain proclaims its support for the disarmament of the Indian Ocean and the creation of a zone of peace in that area with the agreement of the States concerned. Such a step would tend to eliminate the dangers of war and strengthen world peace and security. We call for similar measures to be extended to all other seas and gulfs where littoral States and lands would be within the reach of destructive naval and aerial forces.15.	In the field of the human environment  my country  as I have already mentioned  participated in the Stockholm Conference  and looked forward to further measures to be taken to develop the study and protection of the human environment  particularly in the interests of smaller countries which lack the technical knowledge and expertise to protect their people and material resources from environmental pollution or contamination.16.	Those are the views of my delegation on some of the problems and questions placed on the agenda of this session. Our stand on other matters and questions before us will be revealed during the coming discussions and proceedings of this session."
"13",808,"BLR",27,1972,"Comrade Trepczyriski  the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR sincerely congratulates you  the representative of Poland  a fraternal country in the socialist community of States  on your unanimous election to the office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and wishes you success in this responsible task.42.	We welcome the new Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and the efforts he is directing towards the maintenance and strengthening of peace and international security  which is the principal task of the United Nations.43.	In characterizing the contemporary international scene and ways of strengthening international security  the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR would first like to draw attention to a momentous event which took place 50 years ago  since it has a direct bearing on the development of relations among States and nations and on today's international situation. What I have in mind is the fact that this year the peoples of the Soviet Union and all progressive mankind will be celebrating the fifty-fifth anniversary ofSoviet rule and the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The triumph of the great October socialist revolution brought about the close unification of all popular forces in our country  headed by the working class  with the aim of abolishing the system of capitalist exploitation  and with it the system of national oppression. The complete victory of the ideas of socialist revolution and Leninist national policy has forged all the nations and peoples of our great motherland into a single international brotherhood and has directed their efforts towards the establishment of a new society  based on the unity of the class interests of all workers in the name of that noblest of causes  the building of communism.44.	The voluntary joining of 15 republics in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a clear expression of their socialist sovereignty and provides firm guarantees for that sovereignty. Indeed  the First All-Byelorussian Congress of Soviets states in its Declaration of 2 February 1919 that negotiations should be started with the Russian Soviet Republic towards the establishment of federal links between it and Soviet Byelorussia and addressed to all fraternal independent socialist republics the proposal that they should follow the example of the workers and peasants of Byelorussia and should engage in negotiations towards the establishment of federal links with Soviet Russia and among themselves.45.	The establishment of the USSR and co-operation and mutual aid between over a hundred nations and peoples within a single multinational State  with constant regard for both the interests of our Union as a whole and the interests of each of its component republics  has created favorable conditions for the restructuring of society on socialist foundations  for advancing the economies and cultures of all the Soviet republics and for strengthening the defensive might and the international positions of the multinational workers' State. This may be seen from the example of the Byelorussian SSR.46.	In pre-revolutionary Byelorussia  the per capita industrial output was nearly five times lower than in Russia as a whole. Today  the output of the industry of the Byelorussian SSR in three days in equivalent to a year's output 50 years ago. The Republic uses in one day an amount of electric power which it would have taken over 17 years to produce in pre-revolutionary times.47.	In agriculture  we have passed from the wooden plough and primitive soil-tilling to highly developed collective and State farm production using modern techniques and have turned agricultural labor into a form of industrial output.48.	In education and culture  we have passed from the eradication of illiteracy (before the revolution 8 out of 10 inhabitants of Byelorussia could neither read nor write) to a situation where three out of every five members of the working population have completed secondary or higher education. Moreover  every third inhabitant of the Republic is undergoing some kind of education. On the eve of the First World War  only three books were published in Byelorussia for every 100 inhabitants  while this figure now stands at three books for each individual.49.	During the years of Soviet rule  the life span of the population has more than doubled  and now stands at 72 years.50.	Human well-being is the supreme goal of social production under socialism. Production is constantly growing  and the level of living of the population is rising commensurately. Over the eighth five-year plan period alone (1966-1970)  the real income of the population increased by 40 per cent  while payments and grants from the social consumption funds  ensuring free education at all levels  free medical services for the population  the upkeep of children's institutions and the payment of pensions  students' scholarships  social insurance benefits and other public services and payments  increased by 60 per cent. Housing construction is increasing at a rapid rate: during the last five-year plan period  every fifth inhabitant of the Republic celebrated a housewarming.51.	These advances have been achieved in spite of the fact that during the lifetime of a single generation we have twice been obliged to begin our development practically from scratch. One need only recall the destruction in the wake of the First World War and the civil war and the fact that in December 1944  six months after the liberation of the territory of the Byelorussian SSR from the German Fascist invaders  the industrial output of the Republic was only 10 per cent of the pre-war level  and that immediately after the liberation some 3 million of the population or nearly every other person-were homeless. One out of four inhabitants of the Republic perished in the heroic struggle against the dark forces of fascism.52.	The peoples of most of the countries represented in the United Nations fortunately did not have to undergo similar sufferings and destruction. We know what war means and are endeavoring to ensure that no people should experience the horrors of war and foreign invasion.53.	By its every step and its every act in the international arena  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics confirms that it has been  is and always will be a mighty bastion and the most tireless defender of the peace and freedom of the peoples and of their friendship and co-operation. The first socialist State  created under the leadership of V. I. Lenin  stated in its declaration to all the working Moslems of Russia and the East that the working people of Russia burned with the one desire of attaining a just peace and helping the oppressed peoples of the world to win their freedom.54.	From the earliest days of its existence  the Soviet State has blazed the trail for completely new principles in relations among nations and peoples. Peace and freedom for the peoples; friendship  equality and fraternity between all races and nationalities; peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures; fraternal co-operation and mutual assistance-these are the basic principles which were proclaimed by the Soviet land and which the Soviet Union and the peoples of all its 15 Union Republics have consistently implemented and are implementing today.55.	Today we see that these principles are gaining increasingly wide recognition  that they represent a decisive factor in contemporary international relations  that theyserve as a basis for the concerted policy of the countries of the socialist community and that they have become a banner for all progressive forces. Significant and encouraging changes in relations between States with different social structures are taking place before our eyes.56.	The events currently taking place on the international scene again confirm the profound vitality and effectiveness of the active peace-loving foreign policy of the socialist countries and the great international significance of the program for peace advanced by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  which sets out a series of measures for the settlement of international problems affecting the future of all mankind.57.	Although a relatively short period of time has elapsed since the Twenty-fourth Congress  it is already possible to state quite definitely that it would be hard to find in the past another short period marked by so many important foreign policy initiatives  actions and fruitful negotiations.58.	One of the principal results of the endeavor of the Soviet Union and the other fraternal socialist countries in the sphere of foreign policy has been the strengthening in international relations of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures. The changes that are taking place in this area are positively astounding. After all  only quite recently  as many representatives will remember  there were people who were afraid even to utter the words ""peaceful coexistence"" and did everything they could to obstruct the inclusion of such concepts in the resolutions adopted in the United Nations and other international organizations. But now the principle of peaceful coexistence is proclaimed in the most important international political and legal documents governing relations between States with different social structures.59.	The principles of co-operation between the Soviet Union and France  treaties between the USSR and a number of other countries  the signing on 29 May 1972 of the basic principles of relations between the USSR and the United States  the conclusion and entry into force of treaties between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany   the Quadripartite Agreement  on West Berlin all these represent an effective concretization of the idea of peaceful coexistence. What has been done brings benefits to all the parties concerned and is advantageous to all the peoples  since it serves the cause of peace and progress.60.	The Soviet-American summit talks were an event of major international significance. The Byelorussian people unanimously approves the results of these talks and the important documents signed in Moscow. The outcome of the Soviet-American talks have proved yet again that in today's conditions controversial international problems cannot be solved by the policy of proceeding from a ""position of strength"". They can and must be settled bynegotiation based upon observance of the principles of equality and equal security of the parties  respect for each other's interests and the general strengthening in international relations of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social structures.61.	No objective person can fail to recognize that the documents signed in Moscow are not only advantageous and beneficial to the Soviet and American peoples. As the overwhelming majority of speakers from this rostrum have emphasized  they also promote the interests of all other peoples  the interests of a general relaxation of international tension. The issue now lies in implementing these treaties and agreements.62.	In pursuing their consistent  peace-loving foreign policy  the socialist States are advancing purposes and goals which are in conformity with the interests of strengthening peace and international security and are waging an unremitting struggle for their attainment. When the leaders of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  at their conference at Bucharest in July 1966 6 set out a program for the struggle for peace and security in Europe and proposed the convening of an all-European conference  this sincere appeal was met with a certain amount of skepticism in some Western quarters. Considerable efforts were required on the part of the socialist States and the peace-loving community to persuade the European countries to slough off the accretions of the past  to set aside outworn concepts and to take a fresh look at ways of strengthening peace and security in Europe. Yet it is truly a great aim to transform the European continent into a region of stable peace. And however hard they try  those speakers here who do not seem to like the idea of relaxation of tension in Europe and who are attempting by distorting the truth and juggling with words to substitute the word ""insecurity"" for the word ""security""  will not succeed in stemming the efforts of the peoples to strengthen peace and security on the European continent.63.	The principles of European security are clearly set out in the Declaration adopted in January this year in Prague at the Conference of the Political Advisory Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. They include first and foremost the inviolability of frontiers: any attempt to violate the existing frontiers which were established in Europe as the result of 'the Second World War would jeopardize European peace. Of great importance  too  are the other principles stated in the Declaration  such as the non-use of force  peaceful coexistence  good-neighborly relations and co-operation in the interests of peace  mutually advantageous ties between States  disarmament and support of the United Nations. All these are the lofty principles and purposes which must serve as a basis for relations between the States which will take part in the all-European conference.64.	It is now clear to everyone that a significant improvement has been achieved in the European situation. Now it is essential to move ahead  to take further steps towards the strengthening of peace on that continent  the creation of a reliable security system and the development of all-European co-operation. And one of the most urgent tasks at the present time is the prompt preparation and early convening of the all-European conference.65.	The interests of a relaxation of tension would also be served by the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the generally recognized norms of international law and by the settlement of problems outstanding between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  primarily that of declaring the Munich Agreement to be null and void ab initio.66.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR fully and whole-heartedly supports the views of those countries which consider that current developments also bring to the fore the question of creating a system of collective security in Asia. As Mr. L. I. Brezhnev  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  has stated  such a system should be ""based on such premises as refraining from the use of force in relations between States  respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of frontiers  non-interference in domestic affairs and the broad development of economic and other forms of co-operation on the basis of fully equal rights and mutual advantage"". In these key directions the Asian States could unite their efforts in the interests of the peaceful future of their peoples.67.	Apart from the bilateral and regional efforts of States  great importance must be attached to the collective action of all countries with a view to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In this matter  the United Nations and  in particular  this session of its General Assembly  has a special part to play. The agenda which has been adopted for this session provides the most extensive possibilities in this regard. We have in mind the need to take positive decisions on such vital questions as ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [item 25]  ""World Disarmament Conference"" [item 26]  ""Implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security"" [item 35]  ""The situation in the Middle East"" [item 21]  ""Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples"" [item 22]  ""Preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting"" [item 37]  ""Principles of international co-operation in the detection  arrest  extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity"" [item 52]  ""Report of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression"" [item 88] and many other issues.68.	The United Nations has on a number of occasions reaffirmed in its decisions the key principle of the United Nations Charter concerning the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force in. international relations and the necessity of settling controversial problems exclusively by peaceful means. Further  a Declaration on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear and Thermo-nuclear Weapons was adopted [resolution 1653 (XVI)] which provides that ""any State using nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons is to be considered as violating the Charter of the United Nations  as acting contrary to the laws of humanity and as committing a crime against mankind and civilization"". The United Nations has also advocated the conclusion of an international convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.69.	The dire consequences of imperialist aggression using conventional weapons in conflicts and wars during recent years are well known to everyone. The United Nations has also made a study of the catastrophic consequences for all mankind of the possible use of nuclear weapons.70.	The time has come to take the next step  that is to say  to consolidate the will already expressed by States Members of the United Nations and  as it is proposed in the draft resolution of the USSR delegation [A/L.676]  to make a solemn declaration on the renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and to give such a declaration binding force through adoption of an appropriate decision by the Security Council  to which Members of the United Nations are obliged to submit  under Article 25 of the Charter.71.	Such a decision will fully comply with the principle of ensuring equal security for all States  will promote the termination of existing armed conflicts and will prevent them in the future. At the same time  as Mr. A. A. Gromyko  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  pointed out in his statement [2040th meeting]  the obligation of countries to refrain from the use of force  including nuclear weapons  in no way affects their rights to individual and collective self-defense  affirmed in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  or the inalienable rights of States and peoples subjected to aggression to resist such aggression  or the rights of colonial peoples to struggle for their freedom and independence.72.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR calls upon all delegations to reject firmly the fabrications of any speaker who asserts that a reduction of the danger of nuclear or any other form of aggression will be detrimental to everyone  and it urges them to lend active support to the important initiative of the USSR  which serves the cause of strengthening the peace and security of all peoples.73.	Disarmament continues to be one of the most important problems confronting the international community. This problem is of universal concern and it is therefore essential for all States without exception to concentrate their maximum efforts on its solution. In this connexion we fully agree with those speakers who stated that disarmament is the keystone of the activities of the United Nations.74.	The peoples are naturally particularly concerned by the problem of nuclear disarmament. Its successful solution might be furthered by convening a conference of the five nuclear Powers  an idea which has been advanced by the Government of the Soviet Union.  Such a conference could play an important part in the practical implementation of measures for the elimination of this dangerous weapon.75.	The Byelorussian SSR has advanced specific proposals on the question of convening a world disarmament conference in its letter to the Secretary-General [see A)8817  annex IJ. At this time  we shall merely stress once again that the General Assembly should discuss constructively the whole complex of questions relating to the convening of this conference and should take positive decisions which will allow preparations for it to be started  despite the opposition of individual objectors.76.	We still have before us the problem of the speedy elimination of chemical weapons from the military arsenals of States. As we know  the socialist countries  including the Byelorussian SSR  have submitted to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament a draft Convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction [see A/8818-DC/235  annex B (CCD/361)]  which can serve as a good basis for the preparation of a definitive agreement. This draft was drawn up with due consideration for the opinions and positions expressed by many States  both in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and in the General Assembly.77.	In the circumstances the General Assembly should take steps to activate the question of the elimination of chemical weapons  in order that agreement on the problem may be reached without any unnecessary delay  since every partial disarmament measure is a step towards general and complete disarmament  that ultimate goal for which all negotiations in the sphere of disarmament are being conducted.78.	With regard to the problem of strengthening inter-national security  the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR notes with satisfaction that the basic provisions of the Declaration on this subject adopted at the twenty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)] have become a standard for the foreign policy activities of the overwhelming majority of States. As a result of this  the general trend towards the normalization and improvement of the international situation has been further developed and States are undertaking endeavors at the bilateral and regional levels to promote the strengthening of the security of nations. Under these circumstances  in taking measures for the elimination of military hotbeds and conflicts existing in various parts of the world  we think that it would be desirable to support the efforts of States to set up regional security systems and to call upon States to conduct negotiations with a view to concluding bilateral and multilateral agreements on co-operation in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security on the basis of undeviating observance of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States.79.	It is self-evident that regional security systems should in no way be directed against any other States. They should be the instruments of voluntary co-operation between all the States of the region concerned and should completely preclude attempts of the kind still being made to set certain States against others or attempts to divide the nations by establishing military blocs or groupings.80.	While noting with satisfaction the advances which have recently been occurring in the world  as well as the existing possibilities for the solution of a number of problems  we are nevertheless obliged to note that the military conflicts continuing for many years in various parts of the world are hindering the normal course of international development and the improvement of the international situation.81.	The events in IndoChina are a cause of serious anxiety. While broadly advertising the withdrawal of part of its land forces from South Viet-Nam  the United States has expanded its air warfare to a hitherto unprecedented scale. The American air force is bombing civilian targets  peaceful cities and population centers  is mining ports  is destroying crops  plantations and forests and  most recently  has been destroying dikes and irrigation works.82.	But barbarism and cruelty will not break the spirit of the peoples of IndoChina. Their courageous struggle is gaining increasing support throughout the world. The Byelorussian people  like all Soviet peoples  expresses its solidarity with the peoples of Viet-Nam  Laos and Cambodia in their legitimate struggle and calls for the immediate cessation of United States aggression in IndoChina. The well-known proposals advanced by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam  the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  the National United Front of Cambodia and the Laotian Patriotic Front provide a constructive and realistic basis for the solution of the IndoChinese problem.83.	During the period that has elapsed since the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly  no positive changes have occurred with regard to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. One report after another has been received concerning Israel's aggressive actions against the neighboring Arab States and the aggressors' new criminal acts in the occupied territories. The rulers of Israel  neglecting the fate of their own people  continue to adhere to the policy of aggression and territorial expansion.84.	All the actions of the Israeli rulers over the past period bear witness to the fact that they are determined once again to torpedo the mission of Mr. Jarring  as well as any other effort of the United Nations to attain a stable peace in the Middle East.85.	There can be no question that as long as the Israeli aggressors continue to occupy Arab land  the situation in the Middle East will remain explosive. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and the implementation of all the other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would serve as a basis for the establishment of lasting peace in the Middle East. To attain this goal it is essential  at this session  to unify the collective action of all countries  making use of all the possibilities offered by the United Nations Charter.86.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR decisively rejects the demagogic and slanderous allegations made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel in his statement in the general debate [2045th meeting]  the purpose of which amounted to misleading public opinion  dividing the Arab countries  undermining the efforts of the anti-imperialist forces to achieve a peaceful political settlement in the Middle East and interfering in the domestic affairs of other States. In connexion with his attempts to interfere in the domestic affairs of  the USSR  I shall only say the following: the hat is too big and cannot be fitted on to Zionist heads  even with the help of powerful protectors.87.	An important factor for strengthening peace and international security is the intensification of the role of the United Nations in the solution of important international problems  the enhancement of its effectiveness and authority. To this end  the first requirement is strict and undeviating observance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter by all States  together with renunciation of all attempts to revise the United Nations Charter. In order  to enable the United Nations fully to respond to the requirements of contemporary life  it is essential to cast aside the ignominious legacy of past years and the decisions imposed on the United Nations by the imperialist forces in violation of the Charter.88.	United Nations interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people must cease and discrimination against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations must be brought to an end. The Byelorussian SSR is a sponsor of an agenda item entitled ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea""  and has made active representations for the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We did this because of the necessity of a speedy solution to the problem of the withdrawal of American and all other foreign troops which are occupying South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea  thus laying the foundations for the reunification of Korea on peaceful and democratic bases by the Korean people themselves  without any outside interference.89.	With regard to problems of decolonization  may I say that we advocate the full implementation of United Nations decisions on the abolition of remaining colonial regimes and the eradication of racism and apartheid. Our delegation condemns the actions of the colonial Powers which are hampering the implementation of the Declaration on the elimination of colonialism [resolution 1514 (XV)]  including their military activities in dependent Territories  their use of the veto against the proposals of the African and Asian countries in the Security Council  their supply of arms to the racist regimes in southern Africa  the violation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia  particularly in the form of chrome purchases by American monopolies  and the constantly increasing support given by the leading countries of NATO to the racist and colonial regimes in the Republic of South Africa  Portugal and Southern Rhodesia. The Byelorussian SSR resolutely supports the struggle of the peoples of colonial Territories for their freedom and independence.90.	Many delegations rightly paid considerable attention to the problems of economic development. We share the views of those who advocate the expansion of co-operation among all countries  on the basis of equal rights  in commercial  economic  scientific and technical matters. Such co-operation is bound to lead to a rise in the standard of living of peoples  to promote social and economic advancement in all parts of the world and to exclude all direct or indirect pressure on States which are undertaking progressive social and economic transformations. Our delegation has always defended the right of the peoples of the developing countries to complete sovereignty over their natural resources and to the development of their economies in the interests of their populations. We support the right of the peoples of the developing countries to assume full control over the activities of foreign monopolies in their territories  including problems of the influx and outflow of foreign capital  the distribution of profits and changes in the status of national and foreign property.91.	It is also important to ensure that the activities of regional and other commercial and economic organizations grouping various countries together should not cause damage to the interests of other countries and to international commercial and economic co-operation and also that the various commercial and economic associations of States should observe the principles of reciprocity and equal rights in their relations among themselves.92.	We attach particular importance to the attainment of universality in the United Nations and insistently advocate the admission of the German Democratic Republic  as well as the Federal Republic of Germany  as Members of the United Nations. We also urge that the Security Council should reconsider the application of the People's Republic of Bangladesh [A/8754-SJ10759] and should open the door to membership in the United Nations to that new Asian State. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR considers it essential to put an end to discrimination against countries which are not Members of the United Nations in granting them the right to send their observers to the United Nations even before the question of their admission to the Organization is settled. We have in mind primarily the urgent need to comply with the justified requests of the German Democratic Republic to be allowed to have its observers at the United Nations.93.	The position we have stated with regard to major issues is an expression of the consistency and attachment to principle characterizing the foreign policy course pursued by the land of the Soviets which  together with the other socialist States and peace-loving forces  is carrying on a policy of peace  friendship and equal rights among the peoples  is combating colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and all forms of national oppression  is counteracting the aggressive strategy of imperialism and reaction and is actively campaigning against expansionist wars  for the security and freedom of the peoples and for social progress."
"14",890,"BOL",27,1972,"The presence of the illustrious economist and Polish diplomat and politician  Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski presiding over the General Assembly of the United Nations is an open tribute to his outstanding ability and an implicit tribute to his great country. Poland  the land of heroes and artists  a nation of heroism and sacrifice  has always given us persons of great valor. We are sure that our President will guide the work of our Organization with the hand of a master.137.	I also wish to take this opportunity to express to Mr. Adam Malik the appreciation of my delegation for the wise and correct way in which he presided over the twenty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly.138.	On 1 January of this year  Mr. Kurt Waldheim replaced U Thant as Secretary-General of our Organization. UThant carried on his shoulders for many years the enormous responsibility as the executive and co-ordinating organ of the United Nations before relinquishing his post. The Bolivian delegation wishes to reiterate our tribute and admiration to the ex-Secretary-General  and we express our hopes for success to Mr. Waldheim  who has arrived at a moment of great concern  of grave risks  but also one of noble hopes and expectations. We trust that Providence will enlighten his mind and that the United Nations  under his administration  will regain the faith and confidence of the peoples of the world under a single ideal of peace and justice.139.	A year ago when I first appeared before this great forum  in speaking of my country I was able to state:""Revolution is proceeding now in Bolivia on the basis of a unanimous consensus and along the glorious path of full nationalism. It will always be welcome in America  as elsewhere  so long as it preserves its autonomy and the hallmark of genuine authenticity. When the revolution tries to transfer its own sovereignty it becomes anti-national and hence anti-American."" [1957th meeting  para. 56.]140.	Today  after a reasonable time has elapsed which has allowed us  as a dynamic young nation to get an over-all view and glimpse the main trends and goals  I can say now that the impression I had then  far from being lost or attenuated  has become clearer  and today the Government is supported by a great majority of the people  which is a source of great satisfaction to those of us who entered into a solemn commitment with history.141.	Bolivia today is living through a glorious moment in its republican history  because it lives in peace and order  which are daily being strengthened  because it is based on the peaceful governing of the national life  on the rebirth of our institutions and on the moral and economic rehabilitation of the country after a number of years of turmoil and of anxiety.142.	I expressed to this Assembly at that time my hope for the flowering of my country. At that time it was a certainty based on faith  on my knowledge as a fighting man and a man who knew my people well. But I was also encouraged because I shared the concerns and the dangers of a leader of outstanding virtues and patriotism  Colonel Hugo Banzer Suarez  who at that time was beginning his term of office. Today it is different. Intuition based on a sound approach to one's civic duties has given way to a conviction strengthened by what the nationalist regime has done for the people of Bolivia  and I am honored to represent that nationalist regime in this distinguished gathering today.143.	I digress for a moment because I believe that the United Nations is not  nor can it be  disinterested in what happens among its Member States. In an organization of this nature I believe that there are no irrelevant problems  that mankind's destiny is a single one  and for those of us who compose the international community the hope and disappointments  successes and failures of any Member must affect all the Assembly  which is the home of all where both our joys and our sufferings must be heard.144.	The main concern of the nationalist and popular regime of Bolivia has been to bring law and order to our society. We have guaranteed all forms of freedom  the only restrictions being those that flow from a need to maintain social peace and to fight against all terrorist tactics that had plunged the citizenry into a state of constant fear. Here the Government has been inflexible and severe but just  because the excesses that occurred during the two previous Governments took a heavy toll of innocent victims and brought the country to the brink of chaos.145.	Due to the overweening arrogance of the extremist forces and the impotence of the authorities which were very often guilty of complicity  unprecedented crimes took place in Bolivia  including the cowardly crimes that caused victims among journalists  the assassination of the peasants' leaders  the trials of the combatants who were accused of desertion  and the kidnappings that  on the pretext of raising money for subversion  paved the way for a new form of extortion hitherto unknown in my country.146.	The basic desire of my Government to encourage the rule of law and the unimpeachable majesty of the courts of justice led to the enactment of a new organic law of the judiciary. This body of law is based on a broad sense of humanism  and in accordance with the most modern of juridical techniques  gives added vigor to procedural and administrative acts for more speedy and just administration of justice.147.	But we did not stop there. The Republic of Bolivar and Sucre was living under the ancient codes of the Napoleonic law proclaimed by Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz  whose name they bear. But in a spirit of juridical renaissance  President Banzer has just prepared the new books of law in Bolivia that will enable him to remain in office as a wise and intelligent leader.148.	Another problem that we tackled with decision and courage  as well as with probity and patriotism  is that  of the reopening of the universities. The new statute of the Bolivian university was received with obvious enthusiasm  and it returns to the university its specific function to promote cultural growth and education. Without in any way impinging on the university's autonomy  in the true revolutionary and humanistic sense  but on the other hand  defending its authority and its right to disseminate ideas  the universities have resumed their specific activities in an atmosphere of security and with guarantees for all those who come to the classrooms with the sincere intention of receiving training in the arts and letters  in science and in technical fields. It is with great satisfaction that I can declare that we have restored to the university its high standing  and we are sure that  after the experience acquired in the recent past when it was turned into a terrorist arsenal and a laboratory for nefarious subversive practices  such shameful and criminal acts will never recur.149.	I want clearly to state to this world-wide gathering  where the fate of man on earth is at issue  that in Bolivia we have the widest freedom of opinion. No one is persecuted for his ideas. Human intelligence is not imprisoned in dogmatic cells or sectarian molds. We prefer to run the risk of freedom of expression  the source of culture and the cradle of mankind's growing civilization. We firmly believe that economic and social development must be agreed to and shared and not the result of imposed decisions. Those who suffered sanctions did so not because they disagreed with the Government or because they professed one doctrine or another  but because of the degree of danger that they represented to the life of the nation.150.	Thanks to the moral authority with which the Government is now acting  and its determination to defend peace and fraternity among Bolivians  my country has taken a stride forward in the material achievements leading to economic development.151.	Here we might mention the completion of the oil pipeline that carries 150 million cubic feet of gas a day from the eastern part of Bolivia to Argentina. Because of the chauvinistic demagogy of the previous Government  this work had been long held up and the national economy seriously damaged.152.	In the course of the year that has elapsed a number of estimates have been requested regarding wide-scale industrial projects  such as the oil plant in Villamontes  in the Department of Tarija  which calls for the sizable investment of $12 million.153.	Another project under way is the construction of silos for grains that has recently been signed in the city of Santa Cruz with a very important and trustworthy Colombian firm. And thus our agricultural workers will have a modern system of storage for their products and enjoy better marketing conditions.154.	We might also mention the volatilization plant that has been established in order to improve the grade of our minerals for export; this has been done with the efficient co-operation of the Soviet Union. The smelting plant of Vinto has been expanded with the technical and financial assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany. This will be a true liberation from the economic dependency which was keeping us in the position of a country that only produced raw materials.155.	Quite apart from all this is the highway from Cochabamba to Villa Tunari and from Puerto Villarroel to Puerto Patino  roads known as 1 and 4  which  from primitive roads to the fertile area of the Chapare  have been converted into first-class paved roads. I am sure that they will very soon be a powerful factor in helping to promote national integration.156.	The Abapo-Izozog project  designed immediately to irrigate 300 000 hectares  with this figure being raised soon to 2 million  has also been provided with considerable finances. Once this irrigation project is concluded  Bolivia will export products of the land and we shall carry out great settlement work and shall have sufficient foodstuffs. This will save currency  today being spent in the amount of $40 million a year  for the purchase of food.157.	Hospitals  new roads linking zones and provinces that are today far removed from progress and the productive activity of the nation  public works of local progress  exploration of underground waters in the plateau for the purpose of irrigation  freezing plants  highways  mining camps and settlements  schools  the draining of rivers  national and international airports such as that of Viru-Viru  with an investment of more than $16 million  city halls  the paving of cities  the urbanization of rural areas these and many other works very difficult to list in a speech of this nature reflect the beneficent and progressive work of the State at present.158.	I should like to give a brief outline of the important and significant contribution of private enterprise to the creative efforts of the Government. It has not been alien to the great changes going on. Indeed  it has shown great social awareness as well as a great sense of historic and patriotic responsibility. Without the assistance of private enterprise  it is obvious that national progress would limp along and would be unilateral and it would not be in keeping with a society that belongs to the Western world by its philosophy and its fundamental structures. In the area of cotton alone  despite difficult climatic and other conditions and adverse circumstances  employment and the volume exported this year lived up to what had been planned in March.159.	We have increased capital and reinvestment as announced by the national bank and foreign banks  which provided financing in the amount of $12 million to the Mining Corporation of Bolivia  which is in charge of the nationalized mines.160.	Eighty-two new large  medium  and small industries have been set up in my country. The National Institute of Investments is at present weighing 48 new projects with a total investment of $35 million. It is an organ to encourage new fields which offer opportunities for foreign capital and to guarantee its flow to the country.161.	The spontaneous contribution of private industry of 10 per cent of its profits for the encouragement of new projects in a few months has provided considerable amounts of capital. The interest of investors from Argentina  Brazil  Colombia and other countries has been awakened  and we have thus set up bi-national companies for the development of certain industrial projects.162.	These and other initiatives of the private sector in such a short time are already eloquent proof of the confidence that has been awakened in the minds of investors by the popular and nationalist regime directed by Colonel Banzer  with its sights set squarely on a great future for the Americas and the world.163.	As my Government has carried out intensive work to ensure harmony in the Bolivian family and also to encourage development  we have not overlooked projecting Bolivia's image to the outside world. The President of the Bolivian people has made State visits to the leaders of Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay. At these interviews  which went beyond mere formalities  the most important aspects of bilateral relations were studied. Principles of an international nature were reaffirmed. Future action was projected  both in regional and subregional relations and with regard to our contribution to the maintenance of peace and the settlement of the grave problems that endanger our civilization.164.	These bilateral relations at all diplomatic levels have been established with our continental and geographical neighbors. We do not carry out a policy of preferences but one of harmony  complementing the economies of the other Latin American countries. Thus  with Peru last year we submitted to the Inter-American Development Bank a request for credits to finance the paved road between Ilo and La Paz. With the Buenos Aires Government we agreed to carry on the construction of the road that links Bermejo with Tarija and Potosi. With the nationalist administration of Paraguay  led by General Alfredo Stroessner  we have agreed on the necessity of immediately completing the trans-Chaco road and linking it with the Bolivian roads of Santa Cruz and Sucre  which would bring the Pan-American highway and the marginal road of the forests to the capital of Asuncion  which presided over the task of opening up and settling the Rio de la Plata region in colonial times. At the same time  we have been pursuing a similar policy with Brazil  the country of Pedro II  Rio Branco and Ruy Barbosa. With that Government  we have planned to link up the eastern network of Bolivia with the western network  thereby joining Santa Cruz de la Sierra with the terminal point of the railroad of Cochabamba. This is an important undertaking for Bolivians  on which we base our policy of national unity and also our policy of promoting our development  a task that cannot be postponed any longer. Similarly  an undertaking of continental significance is the linking of our countries and also the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is an undertaking that has its important and transcendental counterpart in the railroad going from Santa Cruz to Trinidad in the north  which was carried out by Argentina and which will link the plateau with the Amazon  thus bringing a fertile land into international trade and joining peoples in the common task of working together for the future of the Americas.165.	Yes  Bolivia located in the very heart of South America  will be criss-crossed by international traffic in the future and will provide shorter routes from the Strait of Magellan and the Panama Canal for certain countries.166.	That is our function today and our destiny. We are the bridge between the coastal countries of our hemisphere  bringing new benefits to mankind. To fulfill this function and destiny  we count on the enlightened understanding of our neighbors and the forthright co-operation of their distinguished leaders.167.	The visit to Bolivia of the Foreign Minister of Colombia  Mr. Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa  opened up a new stage in the relations between my country and the country of Santander  whose armies covered themselves with glory in Junin and Ayacucho  consolidating the independence of upper Peru. That visit led to the creation of a joint commission to study trade relations between the two nations. There is also the forthcoming trip of the Foreign Minister of Ecuador  Mr. Lucio Paredes  to my country  which will link even more closely the peoples that saw the fame of Sucre in Pichincha and Potosi.168.	A separate subject is the foreign policy of Bolivia vis-a-vis Chile. This year  in accordance with what was stated by me last year[1957th meeting]  we have started an open dialog with representatives of the Government of the Palace of La Moneda by the establishment of a joint committee. It is by directly studying the factors of integration that Chile and Bolivia can unite  over and above whatever differences we may have  so that we may arrive at a policy of understanding. There are no insoluble problems or insurmountable differences. Reason  which persuades men and peoples  can lead us to modern and constructive ideas. Security does not lie in our own capacity to commit aggression or to defend ourselves  but in joining our efforts with those of others and putting together the resources we have. For all those reasons  I wish to express my hope here that through sound integrationist reasoning  within the framework of the Andean Pact  Bolivia and Chile will find a way to unite and build a better tomorrow.169.	In times like these  characterized by the principle of universality  there can be no partisan or exclusionary positions. The La Paz Government  convinced of this  is cultivating relations with all those countries that express a desire therefor. We are closely tied diplomatically and commercially to the members of the capitalist as well as the socialist communities. A number of cultural agreements and agreements of technical assistance and scientific cooperation and exchange are eloquent proof of this and they represent what we trust is a far-sighted policy.170.	This conduct in no way jeopardizes our doctrines. Today the peoples of the world cannot ignore one another for we all need one another. Man has awakened to a new era in which he has decided to improve his future and widen his sphere of action in the universe. But to do this the combined efforts of all nations are necessary. The struggle to conquer outer space has confronted ih with a new reality  and that is that our limited frontiers are narrow and egotistical. We can no longer say that our State is ours and concerns us alone. The commitment not to interfere in the affairs of other countries become today more understandable and categorical. We trust that all Governments will act accordingly and thus ensure fraternity throughout the world.171.	In keeping with this universalist philosophy I must infer specifically to the relations which Bolivia would hope to establish with the prodigious constellations of countries of Africa that victoriously have entered the international community. It is an ancient world which appears new  a continent pillaged for centuries that is now emerging to civilization and culture with the formidable talent of a race that is equal to any and which in a very short time has given proof of such creative capacity. The African nations are beginning to be heard when great historic decisions are made and their importance will continue to increase. Therefore it is our duty to offer them cordial and fruitful ties of friendship.172.	From this experience to which I have referred so briefly my Government has arrived at a very favorable conclusion as to the meaning of this international Organization. Its deficiencies are doubtless many. It may well be that it lacks sufficient decision-making power. But it is a positive fact that it exists and that in its short existence it has fostered the birth of many nations.173.	This fully justifies the existence of the United Nations. It is an Organization that can not only bring together almost all of the nations of the world but constantly create new States in the everlasting struggle against colonialism It is a living  dynamic organization  in keeping with the aspirations and the desires of the peoples. The harmonization of the widely differing interests of Member States is indeed a complex undertaking. These are sovereign wills that should try to act in concert to maintain peace  but we must have faith that full knowledge of the risks of a modern war will permit the United Nations to strengthen itself as a universal parliament in which nations compare their interests and try to find harmonious positions in the interests of civilization.174.	Bolivia was represented at the meetings of the third session of UNCTAD  at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Lima  which preceded them and at the meetings of the non-aligned countries  to which we brought our sincere aspiration for political plurality in international relations  mutual respect and friendship for all the nations of the world and indefatigable defense of the self-determination of peoples and the rejection of any form of dependence.175.	My country believes that we have fully carried out our obligations as a Member of the United Nations  because our presence in this building is a consequence not of fleeting circumstances but of profound democratic conviction.176.	We believe that the Charter is a basic document for peace among peoples and for the rule of social justice  without hegemonies  without exclusive sectarianism  without unfounded privileges and based only on the law. If all the Members of this great conclave of nations were to proclaim our faith in the Charter  if we were all to combine to comply with the terms of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I believe that mankind would have gone far towards the achievement of permanent peace. Unfortunately that is not the case. We are still living in a dangerous period of armed peace  a peace based more on fear than on love.177.	We have the Charter and we recognize that it is a most valuable instrument of understanding and harmony  but we lack the decision and the sincerity to comply with it in all its aspects instead of just when it is in line with our interests. The Charter must not become a mere expression of hope or of an unattainable Utopia. But that will depend not so much on the smaller nations as on those that have the resources of power; it will depend on the great Powers.178.	My country  together with all the other countries of Latin America  has subscribed to and ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  We  the Latin American nations  are still on the threshold of the atomic era. To a great extent that might appear to be one more disadvantage that separates us from the developed countries  but if we consider the substance of the problem we must agree that it is instead an advantage. We hope for and desire reactors and laboratories where we can take advantage of this marvelous source of energy for peaceful purposes while still preserving our geographical area from nuclear pollution. In this connexion our position is firm and determined and we supported Peru and other countries which expressed their justifiable fears a short while ago when France exploded nuclear devices over the Pacific.179.	So far the Protocol to the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been acceded to only by the United States of America and the United Kingdom. My Government considers that the Latin American aspiration to isolate our geographical area from the dangers of radiation is perfectly justifiable. Therefore I would remind those countries which have added nuclear weapons to their arsenals that Latin America fervently desires to see the Treaty of Tlatelolco strengthened by the firm adherence of others.180.	On the initiative of Ceylon and the United Republic of Tanzania the General Assembly last year declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. My delegation believes that this felicitous idea should be applied to other seas and continents which have so far been spared the dangers of war. In this .way we should be preserving geographical sectors  and would thus be able to isolate areas of conflict so as to eliminate the germs that generate danger.181.	Latin America  which gave proof of its peaceful spirit with the Treaty of Tlatelolco  would be very interested in a similar declaration regarding the Indo-American area.182.	The history of the world could well be summed up in one phrase: man's struggle for freedom; for without freedom there is no dignity  since in indigence man can only be humiliated and not free. Man has always struggled for this inalienable right  which is just as much part of his vital needs as air  or bread  or water  and he has done so devotedly. As Jesus exalted the most humble and preached equality among men  so my country rebelled against the authoritarian Powers and liberated itself from a slavery which it could not bear. Thus we follow with great interest the process of independence in which many peoples of the world are involved. We are aware that misery and oppression spawn rebellion  but we consider rebellion to be the last stage in justified protest. If the dikes of prudence and fear are shattered and man engages in a heroic undertaking against his oppressors  he must meet them face to face. The struggle against misery is always unequal as far as means are concerned  but it is usually impelled by an ideal and the powerful stimulus that is given by the knowledge that the fight is in a just cause.183.	But terrorism is not that. When you struggle for the rule of justice in the world it is neither lawful nor human nor acceptable  nor even tolerable  to compensate for the hunger for change by the sacrifice of innocent victims who have nothing to do with the maintenance of the situation that is being fought against. The greed for power very often hides in the most extreme tendencies. It seeks supporters among the disgruntled. Psychology is made to serve politics and becomes a very powerful weapon.184.	In this international parliament I must speak sincerely and with vehemence against the use of these practices  which are an affront to our civilization. Today more than ever before the oppressed people have a rostrum here from which to denounce their oppressors. Each year  at each Assembly  we hear denunciations of abuses by the strong against the weak.185.	This means that the peoples which struggle are not without means. The international community has not turned a deaf ear to their cries. Furthermore  there are always institutions  peoples and individuals ready to assist them to achieve the justice to which they aspire and are entitled. Therefore  we cannot complacently watch acts of insanity such as those that recently shocked the world  because the victims were not those who caused the sufferings but were merely the victims of an outpouring of irresponsible hatred.186.	My Government believes that the United Nations should put an end to this new type of violence  particularly because it is premeditated  evil and destructive; it seeks its victims among those who have nothing to do with the problem  as though cruelty wished to drink the blood not only of its chosen victims  but also of humanity as a whole.187.	I should like now to refer to the fight against pollution. At the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  this problem was debated at length; but the problem calls also for some comments from us. We must recognize right away that the concern must be shared by all men. Its significance could be compared to the concern of an astronaut on this spaceship which we call earth. He  too  must worry about his environment  means of life and safety during this extraordinary adventure of life.188.	We agree with principle 20 of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It is quite in keeping with the Declaration of Asuncion  approved on 3 June 1971 at the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Plata Basin. In the matter of the utilization of international waters  the up-river countries must do whatever is necessary to meet their needs  with the sole condition of not causing tangible damage to the nations down-river. This principle  added to the principle of not changing the river bed from one geographical basin to another is a doctrinal concept that Bolivia has consistently supported  in keeping with universal principles of law and reason.189.	Although there is a general trend today not to accept the creation of new international organs because of the burden they represent for Member States  we believe that the case for creating a small body to study the human environment is one worthy of applause. The suggestion by the United States has the widest support of my delegation since it fills a felt need.190.	One final comment. With reference to the question of pollution  it is only natural that this ""phenomenon alarms those countries suffering from it. We are speaking of the highly industrialized nations. But it is for us to tell then; that in the young and still unexplored continents of African and America there is sufficient green space  the necessary oxygen and it is neither rare nor contaminated. In our opulent land can be built new industries without endangering human health. Those industries  in the process of industrial de-concentration and promoting the development of the backward countries  could strengthen their economies and lessen the degree of their dependence.191.	This does not mean that we are unaware of the situation of the countries and cities which suffer from the pollution of their environment. We are at one with them in their search for adequate solutions.192.	From the very moment when  on the initiative of Malta  the question of the sea-bed and the ocean floor was raised in the United Nations  Bolivia has taken a great interest in that question. We were elected a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and our representatives have contributed greatly to clarifying the problems of land-locked countries as far as the sea is concerned.193.	This concern over the questions of the sea by a country which has no coast is neither paradoxical nor extraordinary. Bolivia  together with the other land-locked countries  has a direct  immediate and urgent interest in anything that deals with the oceans of the world.194.	Our participation in the clarification of those problems will not for obvious reasons which we consider circumstantial at the moment-be extended to questions relating to the width of the territorial sea  the continental shelf  fishing or international straits  on which we lack experience. We will therefore limit our discussion to the questions of land-locked countries  their consequences and possible solutions.195.	The process of elaborating principles in the legal field is now under way. The recognition of the sea as belonging to mankind is a positive fact. That means that the wealth of the sea-bed is the common heritage of mankind.196.	We must note that the practical application of those truths is very unequal and  in some cases  non-existent. Although the land-locked countries were ignored in the past  since the Barcelona Agreement and the Geneva Conference of 1958 the international community has turned its attention to the problems confronted by the land-locked countries. We must recognize  however  that the principles thus far approved are deficient. We must  without referring to the specific condition of each landlocked country  recognize the general nature of the right of all countries to benefit from the use of the wealth drawn from the oceans and the rivers; otherwise the universality of the sea would be purely nominal so far as the land-locked countries are concerned and their possibility of utilizing the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor would be illusory.197.	Naturally  in the exercise of those rights in one case as well as in another  there must be different characteristics and features  and their legal formulation is the second point that must be considered by the General Assembly and the sea-bed Committee.198.	Some of these concepts have already been included in the topics and issues to be dealt with at the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at the plenipotentiary level. We have contributed drafts and amendments which  fortunately  to a large extent were accepted at the Geneva meetings. We expect to put forth those same concepts in this Assembly in the forthcoming meetings of the sea-bed Committee and particularly at the conference of plenipotentiaries in 1973  whose convening we support.199.	Only a few more words  addressed particularly to my colleagues the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the permanent representatives of the other land-locked nations. My Government considers it right and proper that  in the course of the present year and prior to the holding of the conference of plenipotentiaries  the land-locked countries meet to study joint formulations which while improving their depressing geographical situation are acceptable to the coastal States. We know that there are various regional realities which require different approaches; but we must recognize that they must be in keeping with certain principles of universal validity. Therefore  my Government intends to act systematically and to make the necessary efforts to make possible the conference of the land-locked countries. In due course we will hold the necessary consultations.200.	In the meantime  we want to draw attention to the two resolutions approved at Santiago during the third session of UNCTAD.  They place a singular responsibility on the land-locked countries to ensure implementation. The first refers to the danger to the under-developed countries of the exploitation of minerals on the sea-bed; and the second warns the industrialized nations that no claims based on past  present or future activities over any part of the zone or its resources will be entertained  and appeals to those States which have made such claims to refrain from doing so until an international regime governing exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor has been established.201.	Land is a universal common asset; and  therefore  it is natural and logical that the sea and its wealth also be considered the general heritage of mankind  to be used for the benefit of all nations. This same general idea relates to what we said last year in our statement concerning the economic equality of States  in keeping with the principle of their legal and sovereign equality. We must say the same regarding the Mexican proposal made during the third session of UNCTAD for the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States. The daring idea of collective economic security put forward by the Brazilian delegation [2038th meeting] is in keeping with the same idea. By studying these ideas and discerning these fraternal purposes  we are led to believe that mankind is heading towards a future of peace and wider international justice. Success in mankind's earnest efforts for a better future depends  in the last analysis  on the determination of the great Powers and on the understanding their leaders show in assisting the development of the less favored nations of the world."
"15",937,"BRA",27,1972,"Brazil is attending the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly in the conviction that the intense diplomatic activity which has in recent months attracted the attention of our foreign ministries should be the subject of thorough study  not only because this diplomatic activity will have an impact on the general interests of the international community  but also because we shall thus be able to gage its compatibility with our Organization's specific competence and objectives.3.	Before I undertake such an analysis  allow me  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your unanimous election and to express my gratification at seeing you preside over our work; for I also bear in mind that you represent a country whose sons migrated to Brazil in substantial numbers and  by their productive efforts and perfect integration into the open and multiracial Brazilian society  contributed in large measure to the progress of their adopted homeland.4.	In addition  I would avail myself of this opportunity to convey to Mr. Adam Malik my appreciation for the serene and correct manner in which he presided over the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly.5.	It is also my wish to reiterate to Mr. Waldheim  whom I have so often met in other diplomatic forums  the satisfaction that my Government and I myself experienced upon his assumption of the responsibilities of Secretary- General of the United Nations. His sense of mission  already evidenced during the brief period in which he has been exercising the functions so worthily discharged by his predecessors  and his diplomatic experience which we all acknowledge and which contributed so decisively to his unanimous election to a post so exacting  yet so full of possibilities-all these qualifications are the best assurance of a reactivation of the role that the United Nations  through its Secretary-General  should play in the international political field. I am certain that in my words of greeting Mr. Waldheim will detect not only the affectionate message of a colleague and friend of many years standing but also and chiefly the conviction held by the Foreign Minister of a country whose international involvement keeps up with its growth that our Secretary-General possesses the indispensable qualities of moderation and dynamism required by the office he occupies. Proof of his capacity for taking the initiative to bring to the attention of the United Nations major problems we are now facing was the solemn appeal he addressed to the General Assembly to find the most appropriate means to combat terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger and take innocent human lives [A/8791 and Add.lJ.6.	It is  in my view  most deplorable that the Assembly has failed to endorse the wording of item 92 as recommended by the General Committee [see A/8800/Rev.l  para. 18]. After the voting on the amendments presented at the plenary meeting last Saturday night [2037th meeting]  the Brazilian delegation stressed two points that we deemed essential to clarify our position: first  we cannot accept terrorism  or any form of violence  as a legitimate political instrument; secondly  the wording of the item as finally adopted contains expressions which have been frequently used in attempts to justify or even tolerate terrorism. We are seriously concerned lest this wording encourage attempts at undue interference in matters falling within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of States and consequently lead to acrimonious and sterile debates.7.	It is not only in recent days that we have been concerned with the problem of terrorism which has affected so many countries  including my own  as is generally known. In January and February 1971 the General Assembly of the Organization of American States met at Washington in extraordinary session to attempt to establish on the regional level a juridical order capable of facing up to and overcoming this intolerable threat to the peace and well-being of our peoples. However  the limited results then obtained did not constitute  in our opinion  an adequate instrument with which to meet this pressing need  as subsequent tragic events have unfortunately proved. I do not feel it necessary to recall the clear and forceful position that Brazil has always adopted with regard to this grave problem. Nor is it my purpose to recall here recent history which must certainly still be in the minds of all. What I wish is to launch now  in this world forum  a vehement appeal for us to hanker to the outcry which requires our statesmen and government leaders to take practical and immediate measures to defend the most elementary principles which should preside over social relationships.8.	We are not prompted by any political preference or any ideological bias when we declare that it is urgent  that it is indispensable  for us to unite and organize ourselves with firmness and determination against the hideous and indiscriminate violence of terrorism to which each and every country has become exposed; indeed  this brooks no delay. We continue to maintain that this indiscriminate violence gives the outright lie to the thesis that terrorist subversion is the fruit of social injustice or of the poverty of a given society.9.	At this juncture let us be truly the ""United Nations""  regardless of our respective and different ideological convictions or patterns of political organization  and let us heed this clamor and be firm and united in the struggle for the final extirpation of violence in any of its forms.10.	The Brazilian nation celebrates this year the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence. The civic enthusiasm with which we commemorate our entry  a century and a half ago  into the community of sovereign States strengthens our determination to build our national destiny in the certainty that  to progress  Brazil must rely on itself and on the work of its people  and to build it in the conviction that this development can be accelerated by the establishment and maintenance of that peace and security which will ensure to each and every one of the members of the international community the right to progress and to stability as well as a sovereign voice and an active presence in the formulation of the world political order. Brazil's diplomacy  which it is today incumbent upon me to conduct  abides fully by the traditions of understanding and negotiation bestowed upon us by our elders.11.	For the past 26 years Brazil has been given the privilege and responsibility of opening our general debate  a custom which brings me to this rostrum as the first speaker for the third consecutive session of the Assembly. This tradition also presents the challenge of initiating a critical analysis of the international political scene in the light of the diplomatic events of the past 12 months and from the angle of the repercussions that same activity will have on this broad and irreplaceable forum for the harmonization of the external behavior of States which is the United Nations.12.	Contemporary international political relationships are characterized by the complexity  extensiveness and swiftness of their evolution. No less characteristic of the times in which we live is the unrelenting persistence of situations and ways of action which Brazil considers ethically unjust  politically anachronistic and juridically condemnable. The conflicting interaction between a new concept of peace and security-new because it is as young as the aspirations we inscribed in our Charter-and the old patterns of international behavior  which we have not yet succeeded in superseding  is basically responsible for the crises and tensions which still exist on the large stage of inter-State relations. 13.	It is not that I am unaware of  or appreciate any the less  the encouraging progress that we are achieving  little by little  along the intricate path of reconciling differences and in the search for the easing of tensions. But I cannot fail to deplore the fact that this slow progress towards the realization of our ideals of peace and security is being attained amidst contradictions and paradoxes  for there continue to weigh on the horizons of the world  albeit apparently less heavily  the dense clouds of nuclear confrontation; a kind of suspended sentence of doom hovers over mankind as a whole. Neither the doctrine nor the practice of strategic balance  nor arbitrary compositions among the poles of international power  have succeeded in extinguishing the fires of regional conflicts. The attempt to coexist within a strategic arrangement or  in other words  the contemporary ""balance of prudence"" referred to by the Secretary-General [A/8701lAdd.l  p. ./] determines the outstanding bilateral diplomatic activity in which the great Powers are currently engaged and reflects the complex problems of today's international reality.14.	But it so happens that the easing of tensions and coexistence are not synonymous with the peace and security we pursued when founding the United Nations. Rather they are palliatives  perhaps opportune in the circumstances  but inadequate and insufficient  serving only to render the political atmosphere less oppressive  yet still not succeeding in brightening it. In fact  to be lasting and fruitful  the easing of tensions should be more than a mere expedient resorted to by the predominant Powers as a function of their national interests.15.	Our sense of reality obliges us to recognize the pragmatic merit of the various initiatives which have enabled us to leap over the walls of dissension and irreducible ideological conflict and pass from the sterile and sombre cold-war years to this period of dialog. But it is indispensable and urgent that the spreading awareness of the impossibility and irrationality of a final nuclear confrontation should result in the institutionalization of an equitable system of international peace and security. I submit that this system  to be enduring and universally accepted  has to be built within the framework of the United Nations and legitimized by it; for this is the true  the genuine  normative forum of inter-State relations.16.	A few months ago  after a long period of waiting that became more and more anxious in view of the unbridled increase in the means of mass destruction at the disposal of the super-Powers  the international community was informed of the first and meager results of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks results which in the final analysis reflect the interests of the microcosm of strategical parity.17.	It is worth-while asking whether the subsystem of lateral pacts is to supersede the United Nations and even override it  or whether our Organization prevails over these pacts and retains its right to appraise and sanction them. So long as strategic parity per se remains the goal  or so long as this parity is construed as the only possible condition and guarantee for peace  this peace will  by definition  be unstable and fleeting.18.	Recent and explicit references to an alleged primacy of the security interests of the great Powers to which lesser interests and  viewed from that perspective  supposedly parochial interests should be subordinated betray the original assumption that some countries can act in consonance with special responsibilities which would politically validate their conduct. The logical consequence of such a doctrine and its ensuing application relegate to a category of secondary objectives the implementation of an effective system of international security in conformity with the conceptual terms of the purposes and principles of the Charter.19.	The considerations of Realpolitik  which at San Francisco influenced the composition and functioning of the Security Council  are not enough to justify bypassing the mechanisms for action envisaged in the Charter  as is increasingly occurring  through negotiations in lateral forums of restricted membership  without the active presence of the medium-sized and small Powers. It is beyond question  in our view  that the participation of the medium-sized and small Powers would be highly constructive and creative; it would be tantamount to an infusion of new blood  which might serve to heal the sclerosis of structures that have aged apparently without being aware of it. How can one deny the validity of the claim to a broader role for the international community in the solution of problems that  after all  are of collective' world interest?20.	We are asked to be realistic. Well  then  let us be truly realistic and take advantage of the atmosphere of detente  the momentum provided by the initiatives that in Europe have resulted in the accommodation of interests through the German-Soviet and German-Polish treaties and the Berlin agreements  which have opened favorable prospects for a future conference on European security. And let us apply this momentum to the international scene as a whole by making full use of the diplomatic mechanisms available in our Organization. Let us give a voice and role in building true peace and lasting security to all of us gathered here  persuaded as we are that the destiny of each of us is closely intertwined with that of all the others  that the development of the poor segment of mankind is a condition for the stability of the wealthy segment of humanity  and that peace and security both political and economic-are inseparable.21.	These same purposes of reconciling points of view and of accommodating legitimate sovereign interests enabled us at Santiago to further negotiations on so many important matters falling within the competence of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]; and in Stockholm to achieve fairly appreciable results towards the solution of the major problem of safeguarding the human environment.22.	The Brazilian Government considers that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment attained its stated objectives  namely  to arrive at a common ""to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment"".    The normative and operational framework adopted in Stockholm provides the bases for broad international co-operation in the preservation of the environment and indicates rational criteria to serve as guidelines for the sovereign action of States in the exploitation of their natural resources  in accordance with their national plans and priorities and without undue interference.23.	The unwavering defense that Brazil has undertaken  and will continue to maintain  of the sovereign right of each State to make full economic use of the resources of its territory for the benefit of its own people does not preclude recognition of its responsibility to carry out its development plans without risk of significant damage to the environment of bordering areas. Our attitude in this regard can be illustrated by the positions we have been taking  in all good faith and in the best spirit of good neighborliness  at the regional forum which specifically deals with this subject and where  we believe  practical solutions that meet all the interests at stake can always be found.24.	Despite the persistence of serious situations of conflict I recognize that  in many aspects  the evolution of international relations appears to be following a more constructive course. But the conspicuous absence of the United Nations from the whole process of the easing of tensions  as though the flow of the major currents of negotiation had been diverted in order to bypass our Organization  has engendered a crisis of confidence and a feeling of frustration which limit the normative capacity of the United Nations. We are obliged to acknowledge that we have not as yet been able to assert the juridical and ethical preeminence of our constitutional document  nor have we been able in the political and security field to render the Organization fully operative.25.	I am stressing the political and security field inasmuch as in the economic and social spheres the performance of the United Nations is less discouraging. Economic cooperation and assistance  as we understand them today and as we intend to develop them further  are products of the consciousness which was born and raised in this very hall and which has in fact enlarged the scope of Chapter IX of the Charter and converted into reality many ideas originally expressed as timid aspirations. I emphasize this fact because the General Assembly christened and sponsored many initiatives which were later shaped in other organisms of our system because the Economic and Social Council did not bestir itself in time to deal with the multifarious problems of economic development and did not exercise its responsibilities in the area of policy-making and co-ordination.26.	In any critical analysis of the United Nations there must be a chapter acknowledging the merits of our Organization or  if one prefers  the merits of its General Assembly-in activating  in giving form and substance to the aspirations to assistance and co-operation nurtured by the large majority of its membership.271 There remains  of course  much very much more to do  in this field. Many myths must be destroyed and much conservatism must be eliminated if we are to make more effective and more active the rendering of international assistance by the rich countries to the poor ones; in order  in a word  to reshape at last the international division of labor  so that the mechanisms of co-operation can function in a manner less hindered by such preconceptions  myths and conservatism. It has been a long and patient effort which is beginning to thrive and which can flourish if we are willing to fertilize other ideas sown in the Charter  ideas that interrelate collective economic security and collective political security.28.	That is the path recently shown us by the Secretary - General  with the authority vested in him  when he said:“... development issues which in the past might have been local or regional in character today affect the entire world and should therefore be dealt with at the international community level... economic problems  just as political and military disputes  affected world security. Collective economic security was therefore a necessary correlate to the concept of collective political security. The concept of collective economic security would give added life and meaning to the International Development Strategy and its review and appraisal mechanism.“It was most timely and appropriate that  at a time when the Economic and Social Council was in the process of self-renewal  it should give serious and careful consideration to this idea and to the practical ways it could be realized.”29.	Here I wish to convey the satisfaction of my Government with the endorsement by the Secretary-General of the Brazilian concept of collective economic security. He has granted this concept the passport with which we hope it will travel through the international economic thinking of the 1970s. It is not Brazil's intention to advocate that we should hasten to arrive at a final formulation of this concept  or that we should hurry to put it into operation  thus risking its faulty  incomplete or insufficient implementation. Quite to the contrary  what we propose is wide-open  frank dialog; what we expect is that we shall work together to refine this concept and to formulate its operational principles. The Brazilian delegation will return to this subject on the proper occasion  in the proper forum  with the sole intent of contributing to the strengthening and improvement of the foundations on which world peace and security should rest.30.	Let me now sum up the main line of reasoning of this presentation.31.	If the process of international organization is irreversible  inasmuch as it embodies a universally shared aspiration and inasmuch as it is a constant in the historical evolution of inter-State relations  why does our Organization so frequently find itself bypassed? Does this situation derive from an option by .some countries not to utilize the Organization as an organ of collective decision? Or is the weakening of the United Nations to be attributed to structural deficiencies stemming from its institutional stagnation  from its inadequacy vis-a-vis contemporary international reality  already so distinct from that prevailing at the end of the Second World War  which the Charter had to mirror?32.	Whatever the reasons for the progressive political  diplomatic and even financial impoverishment of the United Nations  it is urgent to reinvigorate our Organization  to fortify it as a converging center for international politics  to make it regain control over the revamping of the system of inter-State relations  for only the United Nations can provide the juridical-political parameters of conciliation between legitimate national interests and what suits the collective interest.33.	The diplomatic marginalization of the United Nations has been and still is derived to a large extent from its institutional aging process  which reduces its procedural capacity to transform words into action  will into deeds  determination into reality. The Charter of the United Nations is to international relations what national constitutions are to the domestic political-juridical order of Member States. No written constitution has historically succeeded in remaining unaltered. As the societies to which they apply change and evolve  national constitutions evolve and change to avoid becoming a dead letter as the result of refusing to acknowledge and to institutionalize new situations and new social facts. We are currently witnessing at the international level a growing gap between constitutional norms and reality. This is the normative gap  I would say  now being added to the other gaps which so afflict two thirds of mankind.34.	Obviously  the degree of effectiveness of the United Nations is less dependent upon the text of the Charter than upon the political will of States to respect and implement its purposes and principles; it is no less true that any anachronistic norms become in themselves a hindrance to evolution and that the over-validity of supplanted institutions discourages the exercise of that same political will.35.	The Brazilian Government holds that the only alternative is adaptation and reform.36.	My Government fully acknowledges all that is permanent and valuable in our Charter. From this very rostrum  on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  I launched an appeal for us to apply the Charter in its high normative sense  and for us to make full use of the diplomatic capabilities of our Organization.  Thus  as I reiterate Brazil's total adherence to the purposes and principles  I also maintain that it is high time to improve the Charter. I find it a fallacious argument that if we were to redraft the Charter  the political conditions of today would prevent us from producing a document as valuable as the one drawn up in 1945. In this argument there is implicit the pessimistic assumption that  in the course of these past 27 years  the world has become worse and statesmen have become less rational.37.	It is not the intention of the Brazilian Government to suggest that we rewrite the Charter; what is in fact incumbent upon us is to revitalize our constitutional document  to correct its inadequacies  to update it  and  if I may say so  to adapt it to a world that is already distant from the international reality of the post-war period.38.	Interpreting the will of our Governments  the drafters of the Charter themselves acknowledged  with the humility of true statesmen  that they had not produced a perfect and everlasting document. In Article 109 they themselves foresaw and affirmed the need for reform in setting a time-limit for review  a process considered indispensable for the United Nations to endure and advance. I should like to recall that  as early as in San Francisco  the Brazilian delegation  aware of the changeability of the times  suggested that the Charter should be reviewed automatically every five years irrespective of the veto.  When are we to follow the course of action so wisely set forth in Article 109?39.	The Brazilian Government believes that a review and eventual reform of the Charter would decisively contribute to stimulating the political will of States to utilize the avenues of the international Organization in the most effective and comprehensive manner  to render the Organization itself operative and dynamic  at the service of a world in such an obvious phase of transition.40.	In replying to the questionnaire of the Secretary- General [see A/8746]  my Government has already indicated those matters which in its opinion should be assigned first priority in connexion with a review of the Charter. Specific reference was made to the concept of collective economic security and to peace-keeping operations. We also presented suggestions regarding the enhancement of the effectiveness of the Security Council. And  while stressing the inter-connexion between these different subjects  we noted that the debate on the item concerning the review of the Charter would offer an opportunity for an in-depth examination of all related issues and positions of principle having a bearing on the work of the Security Council as well as on its organizational structure. This issue calls for a thorough and unbiased re-evaluation  free from considerations based on the outdated power structure of the immediate post-war period.41.	The acceleration of the pace of international relations and the growing development of the communications media afford the emerging countries the opportunity to break out of the historic isolation in which they have been living and to project their national interests on the international plane. Domestic development concurrently broadens international obligations; growth increases international responsibilities and  consequently  commitments and duties. Brazil has long since made its irreversible choice in favor of all that presupposes clarity and harmony  in favor of just and correct relations with other nations  of good faith in discharging obligations  and systematically rejects the theses of separate paths of progress and of the false rights stemming from power.42.	New life should urgently be given to the ideals of collective security which inspired the Charter  in the form of a system of more operative norms that better encompass contemporary reality   these norms being firmly linked to germane principles of sovereign equality and equality of opportunity among States.43.	True political realism consists in trying to construct a permanent international order founded on collective consensus. This Assembly is the forum par excellence to expand the understandings arrived at among a few on matters of interest to so many  and to render these understandings beneficial to all. It is incumbent upon the United Nations  where the organized international community is represented  to assume the final and untransferable responsibility for forging the bases of an equitable system of international co-operation  to build peace and to defend it."
"16",982,"BRB",27,1972,"Mr.President  I should like first of all to congratulate you warmly on your election as President of this  the twenty-seventh session  of the General Assembly  which is an indication of the high esteem in which you and your country are held. Your country's great contribution to international affairs and your own untiring efforts in promoting goodwill among nations have both been fittingly rewarded by this Assembly.112.	The deep appreciation of my delegation is also extended to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  for the admirable manner in which he guided the deliberations of this Assembly during its twenty-sixth session.113.	To the Secretary-General my delegation also wishes to offer congratulations on his appointment to a most exacting job. He has already given proof that he possesses those qualities of mind and spirit which will be of inestimable value in dealing with the immense problems confronting our Organization. Barbados pledges him its unstilted support as he strives to uphold the principles of the Charter and to implement directives of this Organization and its related agencies.114.	At this time of the year the delegations here assembled sometimes enjoy the privilege of welcoming those new States admitted into the family of nations. My delegation very much regrets that it is not able on this occasion to welcome a delegation from Bangladesh. Barbados was one of the first two countries in the world certainly the first in the Western Hemisphere to recognize the sovereignty of the people of Bangladesh. We hope that this Organization will not repeat the craven blunder which for 20 spiteful years excluded from our family the largest single section of humanity  whose claim to be in full control of its own affairs was always beyond dispute. It is better to count heads than to break them  and for this reason my delegation looks forward to welcoming Bangladesh to this Organization in the very near future. As we bring more sovereign States into the United Nations we provide greater contentment for and   hopefully  easier dispersal of  their suspicions and frustrations.115.	Barbados is pleased to note the very positive steps which some countries have taken in the past year to resolve their differences with others. The great Powers have negotiated with one other and have defined their common interests without  according to the communiques  sacrificing the vital interests of other States. Any accord  however tenuous  which exists among the nuclear Powers must be complemented by a greater willingness on their part to understand that world peace needs a more solid foundation than they seem disposed at the moment to give it. Not to blow the world up shows commendable restraint on their part  but my delegation feels that the purely negative virtue of self-preservation ought to give way to the more positive one of wanting peace for its own sake.116.	It is in this context that we note with satisfaction the attempts being made by the two Korean States and the twoGermanys to talk with each other. We hope that these dialogs will continue until mutual interests are distilled  and that other States will not cumber them with gratuitous  selfish and wrongheaded advice. It would be as well if the two VietNams or what is left of each of them could talk to each other to discover whose war they are waging  and whether the great Powers whose proxies they are would permit them to bring it to an end  or whether the great Powers would transfer it to their respective soils. My delegation also hopes that the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 reached between India and Pakistan will hold firm and lead to an enduring peace among the peoples of those two great Asian States.117.	We have enough realism to known that these accords do not suggest that final solutions to these problems have been reached. But we are certain that these halting but welcome successes have come from the conference table and not from the battlefield. Where there has been persistence in dialog and patience in discussion  something good has emerged. That is why this Assembly must continue to exhort all parties to a dispute  in all the tension-filled areas of the globe  to use the proven techniques of conciliation and negotiation.118.	We must also soften our rhetoric in our debates when we discuss areas of conflict and tension. If the truth must be told  we have not always helped a situation by taking sides in it when we should have been encouraging those in dispute to resolve their differences in accordance with the principles of the Charter. Great causes need to be thoroughly understood before they can be decently espoused  and it is always a better service to world peace if great and sensitive issues are debated with restraint and objectivity.119.	There is a widely held belief among nations that the maintenance of world peace is the special responsibility of the great Powers. It has a limited truth only because the great Powers have greater means at their disposal to breach the peace with impunity. But the maintenance of world peace is the responsibility of all States and it could well be that a genuine policy of non-alignment might encourage the great Powers to be more circumspect in the application of their selfish policies. My delegation therefore believes that all States should first contribute to the peace of their own immediate regions by pursuing peaceful policies with sir neighbors. Within our own hemisphere  for instance  we would wish to see new initiatives taken to end the isolation of the Republic of Cuba on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance  and we  would also wish to see our sister Caribbean State Belize achieve its independence with the positive goodwill of  and without demur from  its immediate neighbors. Outside our own region my delegation will strive with others to encourage the pacific settlement of disputes and we therefore in this session of the Assembly  as in previous ones  call upon the contestants in the Middle East to go to the conference table no matter what its shape or size and bring their tragic conflict to an end.120.	Even while we wrestle with these difficulties  we meet under the shadow of a greater menace. Recent events in an international sports arena  in airports and aircraft and elsewhere have brought into focus the need to answer resolutely and swiftly those who commit cowardly and murderous acts of terrorism. My delegation condemns without equivocation the resort to murder as a political weapon and my Government would under no circumstances shelter or protect organizations or persons known to be or proved to be in sympathy with others who are so engaged. The political assassin is rarely a liberator and if there are countries and States which can make excuses for the seizure of aircraft and the infliction of needless terror upon innocent travelers by air  or can rationalize the cowardly slaughter of the diplomatic personnel of States  then those countries and States neither serve their own best interests nor strengthen their claim to be part of the civilized world. If terrorism is not struck down  then this Assembly will soon cease to be the voice of decency among the nations. No country will then be immune and those countries which even now will not condemn the terrorist will soon find themselves at his mercy because the nihilist will not distinguish between ideologies when the knife and the bomb quiver in his grasp.121.	Barbados  with a tradition of respect for law and order  will support any action taken to stamp out this malignant growth and to erase this terrible blot on the conscience of mankind.122.	But terrorism  like peace  is indivisible. We must not suppose that there is greater immorality in blowing up an aircraft with innocent passengers than there is in the mindless brutalities which are heaped upon whole populations in southern Africa and sometimes elsewhere. In some countries the mere possession of a white skin confers unbridled license to inflict upon darker skins the most bestial assaults  of which the taking of life is perhaps the least unbearable. When States can commit acts of aggression against whole peoples in the name of a counterfeit philosophy of racism  and can do this in full defiance of world opinion  it should not astonish anyone that wicked all depraved individuals should plan and encompass the murder of others and even boast about it  while some States  whose agents they may be  nurse their guilty secrets in complacency. My delegation therefore calls once again upon this Assembly to condemn and outlaw all forms of assault upon human life and dignity  whether the aggressors are homeless and misguided robots  or whether they happen to be  for the time being  entrenched in the control or possession of States. This threat of terrorism and anarchy has always been with us and in our haste to utter a rightful condemnation of the new gangsterism we must show the same sense of urgency in rooting out the detestable racist regimes which exist in any part of Africa or elsewhere.123.	There is a necessary connexion between the ills we condemn and the economic injustice yet another form of terrorism which is suffered by the majority of States. Hundreds of millions of human beings in Asia  in Africa and in Latin America still live-if that is the word for it-in great but still unfulfilled expectations of a fairer share of the world's trade. At the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in Chile earlier this year  while the rich nations were prepared to discuss freely how hungry nations were to be fed  or how the primary commodities of poor countries were to bring good prices in the markets of the few  those same nations were not prepared to make the decent political commitments which would help developing countries. They had no sooner left Santiago than they set about stiffening the terms of trade by all those artifices which are designed further to impoverish the already poor countries. They manipulate the world's currencies always to their own convenience and would have us believe that the world's future depends on what artificial values they choose to bestow upon the bits of metal or paper which they use to siphon off the profits of the world's trade into their own countries. They scurry to one another's capitals to decide how the world should be run  and  inevitably  their decisions decree that the peasant in Africa or Asia or Latin America must pay more for goods and services produced in a few countries  but must sell  if he can  what he produces at prices which drive him further below the poverty line.124.	As if that were not enough  the richer nations have devised yet another means of pauperizing the rest of the world. Not long ago we heard many pious resolutions about the allocation of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product to raise the rest of us above the poverty line. A few countries equal to the number of people who could stand in a telephone booth have honorably tried to meet this obligation. A few others were lavish in promise of aid and have fulfilled their promises by tying their assistance to such burdensome restrictions that recipient countries either have refused the help or have impoverished themselves further by accepting it.125.	It is no accident of history that the world's major trading and financial powers are precisely those which once held great empires or extended their military and economic influence beyond their patrimonial seas. Old habits die hard and the cynical substitution of ""spheres of affluence"" for ""spheres of influence"" is but the new method of controlling the world without the vulgar necessity of having to govern it.126.	A very casual glance at the conditions laid down by the European Economic Community for association with it  or even for selling anything to its members  will indicate that this venture may well become a conspiracy in restraint of world trade.127.	It will be the duty of this Organization and its agencies to search out and  if not prevented  find solutions to the problems of international economic development. The agencies must develop proper insights into the question of poverty in the under-developed world. They must take note of the different levels of development  but they are not entitled to categorize some poor countries as well off merely because their pride and industry inhibits them from passing around their begging bowls.128.	While the poor nations struggle to find some redress to the prevailing economic imbalances  the resources of the sea and the immense wealth that lies in the ocean bed and the subsoil thereof have presented some glimmer of hope. In June this year  Barbados  with other Caribbean countries  while stressing that the resources of the sea  sea-bed and subsoil of the maritime areas within their jurisdiction and adjacent to their coasts can help to improve the living standards of our peoples and accelerate progress in our countries  recognized the need to preserve and protect these resources. For not only are these resources being contaminated and polluted  but they are already being exploited and utilized to increase the wealth of those nations which by their manipulations pauperize the rest of the world.129.	The immediate need to regulate the use of and preserve and protect the marine resources makes it urgent that arrangements be concluded for the international conference on the law of the sea.130.	Today more than ever there is need for the United Nations to act with determination to meet the ideals of peace  justice and progress enshrined in its Charter. Even while the Organization is preoccupied with adopting measures to arrest the wave of disrespect for human life  which has reached alarming proportions  greater efforts must be expanded to overcome the frustrations of the many peoples of this world and bring into reality their desire for a better life.131.	All States Members of this Organization must assist in this regard."
"17",1057,"BTN",27,1972,"I should like  on behalf of His Majesty the King  the Government and the people of Bhutan to extend to Mr. Stanisfew Trepczynski our warmest congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In his capacity as Deputy Foreign Minister of his country he has already distinguished himself as a statesman of high caliber. We are confident that under his able guidance our discussions during succeeding months will be fruitful. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay my tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  who guided the deliberations of this Assembly during the last session with such great distinction. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  I should like to pay a special compliment for his wise and dedicated leadership of this world body at a moment when it is faced with so many complex and crucial problems.2.	Bhutan became a Member of the United Nations last year. For several centuries we had followed a policy of self-imposed isolation to preserve our country's sovereignty and independence. While the policy was successful in achieving that objective  it left our country socially  economically and politically backward. The man primarily responsible for ending that policy and leading our country into the mainstream of the modern world was His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck  who passed away recently at the young age of 44 years  following a heart attack. There have been extremely few monarchs in the history of the world who like him have been so selfless  enlightened and progressive. During the 20 years of his reign he introduced sweeping social  economic and political reforms which have changed the face of our country. Under his wise and inspiring leadership we have made significant progress on the road to modernization. With the help of our friendly neighbor India we are building up the social and economic infrastructure of our country through a series of five-year plans  two of which have already been completed and a third was launched last year.3.	Our new King  His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  is determined to follow in the footsteps of his great father. In the sphere of foreign policy  His Majesty has reaffirmed our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter and to the policy of non-alignment and friendship with all countries. In the domestic sphere  His Majesty has pledged himself to work selflessly and with devotion to provide our people with a better  richer and fuller life.4.	The preceding year has been a momentous one. Although the world continues to face many serious problems  certain hopeful signs have begun to emerge. President Nixon's recent visits to China and the Soviet Union have for the first time after several decades unfolded opportunities which could usher in an era of real detente. My delegation welcomes this positive development and we hope that these new contacts which have been established between the leaders of the United States on the one hand and China and the Soviet Union on the other will contribute positively to bringing about real peace in the world. In the context of improved relations between the major Powers of the world  and in the context of the changes that are taking place in Asia  Africa  Latin America  Europe and other parts of the world  we can now look forward to the coming years with hope and optimism.5.	For the first time in over two decades  signs of peace on the Indian subcontinent have begun to emerge. The possibility of a thaw in Indo-Pakistani relations is no longer a remote possibility but a possible reality which is within the grasp of the leaders of India and Pakistan. This affords the people of the subcontinent a real chance to live in peace and amity. We have noted with satisfaction the outcome of the recent summit meeting between the leaders of India and Pakistan  which has resulted in some significant progress being made towards a lasting and  durable peace on the subcontinent. We are convinced that the leaders of both India and Pakistan desire genuine peace and it is the hope of my Government that the two countries will be able to work out satisfactory solutions to their problems without interference from outside.6.	Bhutan welcomes the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent sovereign nation. We extended our sympathy and support to the people of Bangladesh during their struggle for national liberation and we are happy today that we were one of the first to recognize the reality of Bangladesh a reality which has now been recognized by over 90 nations of the world. We wish the people of Bangladesh well and hope that they will be able to take their rightful place in this Assembly of nations without further delay.7.	The emergence of Bangladesh and the changes that are taking place on the Indian subcontinent have undoubtedly brought about new political equations in Asia. Bhutan is fully conscious of the far-reaching changes that are taking place in our part of the world and we are taking the necessary steps to adjust our attitudes and policies in the context of those changes. It is gratifying to note that our relations with our neighbor India continue to be most cordial and friendly. Our relations with India are based on equality and mutual trust and advantage  and we look forward to an era of still greater co-operation and friendship with India in the years to come.8.	My delegation considers the contacts which have recently been established between the leaders of South and North Korea as a positive factor leading to the restoration of peace and normalcy in that region  as a prelude to the eventual reunification of Korea. We welcome those positive developments and fully support the efforts of the people of both South and North Korea to establish durable peace in their country.9.	My delegation has read with great satisfaction the joint communique issued on 29 September 1972 by the Prime Ministers of Japan and China at the conclusion of Prime Minister Tanaka's visit to China. We welcome these high- level contacts and the decision which was taken to normalize relations between those two great Asian countries. Improved relations between Japan and China will undoubtedly be a positive factor in ensuring peace and stability in East Asia.10.	We have also noted with satisfaction the climate of detente in Europe and we welcome the agreements recently signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland. We also welcome the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the contacts established between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic with a view to improving relations between them.11.	These hopeful signs should not  however  blind us to the fact that the world is still not free from conflicts. In the Middle East little progress has been achieved towards a lasting peace. My delegation believes that Security Council resolution 242(1967) provides the requisite framework within which a peaceful solution' of the Middle East problem could be found  a solution which would take into account the just and legitimate aspirations of all concerned. We are convinced that this problem can be solved through peaceful means without resorting to force. It is the hope of my delegation that all concerned will work towards the peaceful solution of this tragic problem. In this connexion we have noted with satisfaction that Ambassador Jarring has resumed his mission to bring peace to the area. We wish him every success in his difficult task. It is equally the hope of my delegation that the conflict in Viet-Nam will come to an end soon and that the people of that war-torn land will be able to live once again in peace and harmony. The recent decision to resume the peace talks in Paris is a welcome development in this regard and my delegation expresses the hope that its outcome will be fruitful.12.	During the past two years or so significant progress has been made in the field of disarmament. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union have resulted in a partial accord. My delegation welcomes the recently concluded treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States in that connexion.  My Government is totally committed to the concept of general and complete disarmament and would like this limited accord to be extended so as to encompass a wider area of general disarmament in all its aspects. It is in the same spirit that we welcome the agreement signed in Moscow during the visit of President Nixon relating to co-operation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. My delegation will continue to watch with interest the proceedings of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  whose achievements  though limited so far  have not been insignificant. We consider it imperative for all nuclear Powers to fully participate in the deliberations of the Committee on Disarmament so that this forum could become more representative and effective. My delegation supports the proposal to convene  with adequate preparation  a world disarmament conference  with the participation of all countries of the world.13.	My delegation shares the concern of our Secretary-General and other Governments at the alarming increase that has taken place in terrorist activities in recent months. We firmly believe that any form of intimidation or terrorist activity ought to be condemned. We view with serious concern the increase in such activities in recent years and would support any move which would  through collective action  bring an end to this senseless violence which causes suffering to so many innocent individuals.14.	During the last General Assembly session my delegation supported the proposal to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. My Government is convinced that as a first step it may be desirable to declare such areas or zones as could be mutually agreed upon as areas or zones of peace. We note with regret  however  that little progress has been made so far in implementing the provisions of the General Assembly resolution on this subject [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. Being a hinterland State belonging to the Indian Ocean area  Bhutan is deeply interested to ensure that the Indian Ocean and the adjoining areas should be free from becoming an area of confrontation between the super-Powers.15.	Another area which constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security is colonialism and racism. In spite of several years of sustained efforts by the various United Nations agencies  Territories such as Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau)  Southern Rhodesia and Namibia continue to be under foreign colonial occupation. My delegation is disappointed that very little progress has been made in accelerating the process of liberation of those colonial Territories. While my Government has noted with satisfaction the results of the efforts made by the Secretary-General to establish contacts with the leaders of South Africa and Namibia with a view to bringing about the independence of that Territory  we are not very hopeful that the Government of South Africa will heed the voice of world public opinion. The recent decision of the Government of South Africa to agree to the appointment of the representative of the Secretary-General for Namibia  while a welcome development  should not blind us to the position South Africa has always taken on the question of Namibia. My delegation has also noted with regret that in spite of the pressure of world opinion the Government of South Africa continues to practice unabated its policies of apartheid and racial discrimination. My delegation also views with concern the fact that no progress has been made to end the illegal white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. We are of the view that the hands of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations must be strengthened so that the United Nations could act as an effective instrument for ending the evils of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination.16.	My Government  like the Governments of many other countries of the third world  was disappointed at the outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. If one of the major causes of friction and tension in the world is to be eliminated  then we must make a determined effort to reduce the massive disparities which exist in the standards of living of the peoples of the developed and the developing countries. My delegation had hoped that the recently concluded session of UNCTAD would provide an answer to some of the principal causes underlying this ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor nations of the world. It is  therefore  with a sense of deep disappointment that my delegation noted the very limited results achieved at the session. When the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] there was hope that we might yet  through collective action  solve some of the problems of trade and development. The subsequent events have  however  belied those expectations. We hope that the United Nations will be able to provide the necessary impetus and the machinery to solve these problems  which are of crucial importance to the developing countries.17.	Although my Government could not participate in the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June 1972  we have followed its deliberations with great interest. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the adoption of the Declaration by the Conference is one of the important landmarks in the history of the United Nations. While we realize that the problems of pollution and the environment cannot be solved overnight  the recent Conference has created the necessary awareness amongst the peoples and the nations of the world of the gravity of these problems. This in itself is a significant achievement  and I have no doubt that the continuing machinery of the Conference will take the necessary follow-up action in the matter.18.	During the last quarter of a century man has made remarkable strides in science and technology. Today we have the means to utilize this remarkable knowledge we have gained for the good of all mankind. Man is ready to explore the tremendous wealth of outer space and other planets and of the seas and oceans. The resources of the sea have a tremendous potential if harnessed properly. My Government  therefore  welcomed the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and the Subsoil Thereof  Beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction  adopted by the General Assembly two years ago [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. We continue to support all measures aimed at declaring outer space and the sea-bed and ocean floor as the common heritage of all mankind  to be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes. My Government regards the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction as of great importance and will closely watch the outcome of the proposed conference on the law of the sea scheduled to be convened in 1973.19.	In conclusion  I should once again like to pledge my Government's continued support of the ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter. We pledge to work towards our common ideals and aspirations in the pursuit of peace. We are convinced that the United Nations remains one of the best hopes for mankind's survival. We shall not fail to contribute our modest bit in the strengthening of the United Nations so that this great Organization may continue to further the cause of world peace  progress and security."
"18",1141,"CAF",27,1972,"The outstanding election of the representative of Poland as President of this year's session of the General Assembly fills us with joy. We believe that at one and the same it is a tribute paid to his qualifications as a statesman and his wide knowledge of international problems and a tribute paid to Poland  a country that is friendly to the Central African Republic.174.	I should like to associate the delegation of the Central African Republic with the warm congratulations and good wishes that have been addressed to him  to assure him of our full co-operation and to express the deeply felt conviction that under his enlightened guidance our work will lead to results that will live up to his competence and be worthy of the United Nations.175.	I am also pleased to pay a tribute to your illustrious predecessor  Mr. President  Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister forForeign Affairs of Indonesia. We greatly appreciate his tact and outstanding competence  thanks to which we were able to work calmly during the course of a particularly difficult session.176.	Finally  it is also a particular pleasure for me to extend again to our eminent Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the personal congratulations of General of the Army Jean-Bedel Bokassa  President for Life of the Central African Republic and of the Government and people of my country  as well as my own personal congratulations  on his appointment to such a high and arduous post at the end of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.177.	We are not unaware of the many difficulties that he will confront  but we know  too  that he will give the best of himself in order to overcome them. In assuring him of our unconditional support  we can only wish him great courage and excellent health so that he will be able to work as long as possible on behalf of our Organization.178.	The year 1972 will have been a year of detente  marked by the process of profound change that has taken place in the structure of international relations  and more particularly among the great Powers. We must mention the Soviet-American agreements on the limitation of strategic offensive and defensive weapons; the allied Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin; the agreements between Poland and the Federal Republic Of Germany and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic; negotiations on a treaty to normalize relations between the two Germanys; the announcement of a European security conference; the agreement between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America; the visit of Mr. Tanaka  the Prime Minister of Japan  to the People's Republic of China; and the rapprochement between the two Koreas  to name but a few.179.	These changes were welcomed with joy and satisfaction by the international community as a whole  and particularly by my own country  the Central African Republic  whose domestic and foreign policies have always been based on peace and represent progress that must not be underestimated.180.	But  unfortunately  we must also note that certain principles of the Charter are far from being complied with.181.	Peace is constantly being disturbed by the persistence or outbreak of numerous conflicts in different parts of the world.182.	The arms race makes the day of disarmament seem ever more remote. The international division of labor  learnedly advocated by some  nevertheless widens the gap between a super-industrialized world  replete and satisfied  and a world where hunger  sickness  ignorance  need and destitution are the daily portion of hundreds of millions of human beings.183.	Entire peoples are still held in the shackles of colonialism and are despised by the racists  while neocolonialism tries to maintain or consolidate its interests by organizing  assisting or encouraging subversive activities and conspiracies intended to change by violence the regimes ofStates where the neo-colonialists feel that their interests might be harmed or simply threatened.184. Briefly  we must recognize with bitterness that social peace  economic peace and peace itself still must be achieved.185. In fact  my delegation is fully aware that the war in South-East Asia  which is unscrupulously maintained by certain great Powers  continues to bring anguish to the tortured souls of the peoples of Viet-Nam and Cambodia  who strongly desire peace and happiness. But it was with satisfaction that we heard from this rostrum a few days ago the statement by Mr. William Rogers  the United States Secretary of State [2038th meeting]  in whir! he spoke of a cease-fire throughout IndoChina under international supervision and a total withdrawal of United States troops that would allow the VietNamese people to settle their problems themselves and to decide upon their own future. We are convinced that that was not merely thinking aloud  but that it was a statement of high political import that will without doubt begin to be implemented very soon.186.	The Middle East crisis is still one of the main concerns of our Organization. We continue to believe that the only road to a peaceful settlement of that painful conflict lies in the strict application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and in the resumption of the Jarring mission.187.	What are we to say of the persistence of colonialism and of racial discrimination in Africa  and particularly in southern Africa? In South Africa  in Namibia  in Zimbabwe  in Mozambique and in Guinea (Bissau) the dignity of the black man is still being offended. His fundamental and inalienable rights to self-determination are constantly being trampled underfoot  despite all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.188.	The unholy alliance which has arisen in southern Africa between the forces of Portuguese colonialism and the forces of racism of Pretoria and Salisbury and is intended to maintain the supremacy of the white minority constitutes the most heinous crime of this century against mankind.189.	We strongly condemn and denounce the attitude of certain Powers which not only encourage the racist regimes entrenched in southern Africa and the Portuguese policy in their colonies but continue to deliver weapons to those regimes in order to perpetuate foreign domination in Africa and to allow it to reconquer its positions from its devilish strongholds.190.	In this connexion we urge the countries directly or indirectly concerned to take into account the Declarations of Lusaka  and Mogadishu  and the more recent Georgetown Declaration of 1972 on these questions. Our firm conviction has been and remains that it is imperative that suitable measures should be taken to allow the United Nations to play a wider and more effective role in the elimination of colonialism and racial discrimination in Africa and in the field of peace-keeping and security in the world.191.	The full implementation by all Members of the United Nations of the resolutions of this Organization is  we believe  one of the basic elements in the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination. We are pleased to note the praiseworthy efforts already made by the Secretary-General in these fields and we should like to encourage him to continue along these lines.192.	But how could I end this chapter without mentioning a problem that has been the number one problem in the tendentious international press  a problem insidiously introduced in the General Assembly by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? I am speaking of the Uganda question.193.	In fact  despite the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the principle of respect for national sovereignty  it is undeniable that certain great Powers continue to organize slander and smear campaigns against other States which are wedded to peace and justice.194.	May I state on this subject that my delegation is amazed that  after having suffered an unprecedented failure when the people of Zimbabwe rejected the so-called Anglo-Rhodesian arrangements  that same Great Britain has again tried by low and devious maneuvers to focus world attention on a problem that falls exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of a sister republic  namely  the Republic of Uganda.195.	For our part we believe that it is not within the purview of the United Nations and the General Assembly to find any solution whatsoever to the problem of the expulsion of what the representative of Uganda quite justifiably termed ""British citizens of Asian origin"" at one of the recent conferences in Africa.196.	What are we to say? Are we to set up our Organization as a biased international tribunal? No! The problem presented to our august Assembly is a false one and we must combat it by opposing its consideration  because in the view of my delegation that is a problem that is essentially a domestic problem of Uganda.197.	How  then  can we explain that Great Britain refuses to welcome on its own soil British subjects expelled by Uganda solely because they are of Asian origin and asks us  the United Nations  to solve in its stead problems which concern it directly?198.	Today the ideas of peace and security  of development and wide-scale multilateral co-operation are supported and appreciated by an ever-growing number of countries. Real conditions exist  such as trade and international economic relations that  we are sure  can become important factors in the maintenance and strengthening of peace and economic and social progress of all peoples.Imbued with this conviction  we said last year from this same rostrum:""For us  in a low income country  the most important objective is and remains the economic and social progress of our people. That is the top priority."" [1958th meeting  para. 223.]199.	We earnestly hope that the United Nations will be able to bring together the industrialized and the developing countries into a network of economic  trade  technical  social and cultural co-operation. In so doing it would widely contribute to the transformation of the human condition in a very inequitable world.200.	One of these inequities  as we know  lies in the daily deterioration of the terms of trade which deprives the developing countries of the necessary resources for their arduous struggle for economic progress and helps to widen the gap that separates the needy from the wealthy countries.201.	The state of international co-operation between the industrialized countries and the third-world nations is far from satisfactory. Today it is undeniable that the third session of UNCTAD held at Santiago did not offer new prospects in trade  nor was any real progress achieved in the desired implementation of generalized preferences. We are still waiting for a spectacular upswing in the curve of transfer of capital  which  unfortunately  has not changed.202.	How could it be otherwise when many countries were diffident regarding even the holding of that session?203.	As regards public assistance  today it is reduced to a level that is less than half the commitments established in the International Development Strategy. We might then wonder regarding the future of that so-called Strategy for the ""Second Development Decade"".204.	However  we have not given up hope and we trust that the series of provisions approved by the General Assembly more than a year ago will enable a United Nations development system to handle significant resources more effectively. We are looking forward to the effective implementation of all these measures.205.	Furthermore  we urge the Organization to bring to bear its influence on the specialized loan agencies in order to encourage greater assistance to the needy nations.206.	In this regard  we feel that these financial organizations should lend a more willing ear to certain vital projects that are so necessary to the developing countries  particularly the least favored ones  such as the land-locked nations  into which category my own country  the Central African Republic  falls when  for different reasons these projects have not acquired financing from bilateral assistance or from private capital sources.207.	The land-locked developing countries feel that the special measures adopted to favor them will not meet their needs until they are allowed to participate effectively in world trade and its growth and until they are guaranteed access to the sea and possess the necessary transit facilities.208.	In this connexion it is with great pleasure that I draw the attention of the Assembly to the joint efforts of the African countries to carry out a road project  whose importance is obvious to all  for the linking of Mombasa in the east and Lagos in the west of the African continent. Surely this project deserves the unreserved support of the international community.209.	On the other hand  it is with great pain that we are reluctantly forced once again to complain from this rostrum of the fact that the railroad project for the linking of the Central African Republic with the Atlantic Ocean  thus releasing my country from its land-locked status a project that was studied for many years and was placed before the World Bank for financing has been languishing endlessly in the offices of that great international organization  although we are a .full-fledged member of it. The reasons for this indifferent attitude towards us escapes our modest understanding; but in the light of the situation how are we to speak of social justice and peace in the world?210.	I cannot remain silent about a problem which is of concern to the Central African Government  that of environment. I am happy to recall that my country was present at the Stockholm Conference and took a very active part in the work done.211.	Although the Central African Republic does not suffer equally with the industrialized countries from problems of the environment for which we thank God we are aware of the inter-penetration of the problems of development as a whole with those of the environment and we therefore hops that the United Nations  which bears an important responsibility in this matter  will forthwith adopt suitable measures to ensure the welfare of man and the future of humanity. On the problem of the protection of the environment the United Nations cannot adopt a complacent attitude. The least we could expect would be a policy of vigilance.212.	It is obvious that the developing countries admit the need for foreign capital  but they do not expect miracles from outside.213.	We are also aware of the fact that foreign assistance cannot be effective unless it is based on an intensive national effort. As far as the Central African Republic is concerned  under the guidance of its dynamic Head of State  His Excellency General of the Army Jean-Bedel Bokassa  and within the framework of Operation Bokassa  a vast and original strategy for the harmonious development of all the potential of the country  of which I spoke at great length last year from this same rostrum [1958th meeting]  the Central African Republic has turned resolutely to continued national participation  thus supporting the economic  social and cultural development of our country.214.	The results of this strategy  particularly in the agricultural field  have gone well beyond our expectations  and we justifiably think that the specialized agencies of the United Nations  which are already assisting us  will increase their assistance in the years to come in promoting this great national undertaking for the benefit of the hard-working people of Central Africa.215.	In the present troubled world conditions we can only hope that the Second Development Decade will link the Development Decade with the Disarmament Decade. The two are closely related and they must become one  if not in the letter at least in the spirit  in a Decade of peaceful co-operation for the increased well-being of all peoples.216.	It surely would not be Utopian to ask the United Nations  on which we found our hopes for a better world  to do all in its power so that this day and age which is already witnessing a universal civilization may mark the beginning of true brotherhood and justice in the world.217.	I would appeal to the peoples of the United Nations on the face of the earth to attack all the ills that threaten peace  so that from the untapped oceans and outer space we may prepare for a harvest of peace."
"19",1185,"CAN",27,1972,"Mr. President  the Canadian delegation looks forward with hope and determination to the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session  over which you will preside. We count upon you for that same wisdom and judgment which characterized your distinguished predecessor's term of office. Your election is a mark of our high regard for you and for your country. Poland symbolizes for the world the unquenchable flame of national will blazing out after centuries of darkness. We remember that the terrible war which brought this Organization into existence began in the defense of Poland's national independence. We remember  too  the debt every country in the world not least my own owes to the Polish people in all the arts of civilization. How fitting it is  Mr. President  that the year of your election should be the five hundredth anniversary of the birth of that towering genius  Nicolaus Copernicus  to whom all mankind stands debtor.23.	May I welcome you also  Mr. Secretary-General  to the indispensable duties upon which you have embarked so vigorously. With the whole world as your province  you have already traveled widely. Canada was honored by one of your first visits as Secretary-General  as it was some years ago by your first appointment as ambassador of your country.24.	Your concern for both the authority and the efficiency of the United Nations has been evident from the outset in the measures you have taken to assert the one and enhance the other. You have our admiration and our support. It is a current commonplace to take a dark view of the performance and prospects of the United Nations. One respected international commentator observed just the other day that ""the United Nations has never been weaker than it is now""  while your predecessor  Mr. Secretary- General  has called the phase through which the Organization is now passing ""a time of trials"".25.	There is ample evidence to justify a sense of defeatism. The international community often seems incapable of preventing war  powerless in the face of acts of terrorism  apathetic at the spectacle of starvation and misery  and irresponsible in its willingness to risk permanent damage to the environment. We seek to explain this by observing that in a world of sovereign nation-States  the United Nations is bound to reflect the weaknesses of the international society which produced it. Time and again  national egotism seems to be the ruling principle of that society.26.	This is at the root of the world's deep anxiety. For the better part of this century  we have known that nationalism has imperfections. Yet mankind is not about to do away with sovereign States. Indeed  the events of the century  by breaking up old empires and multiplying new sovereignties  have acted as a stimulus to nationalism. New States are not willing to deny themselves the advantages they believe older States have gained from national independence. Certain great tasks of social and economic construction are indeed impossible except in conditions of independence and  while some advantages of independence may prove illusory  even this is irrelevant since the Charter establishes national sovereignty as a fundamental principle.27.	Those are powerful considerations. In the face of them  it is unrealistic to plan for an international order in which the system based upon sovereign national units has been replaced. Instead  it is more hopeful and more sensible to work to transform the existing system  encouraging it when necessary to produce the antidote to its own poisons.28: There have been encouraging developments in this sense recently. Even in the brief space of time since last we met  relationships between the great Powers have undergone' a remarkable transformation. Earlier this year  the two nuclear super-Powers signed a declaration on basic principles governing their relations   an agreement limiting anti-ballistic missile systems   and an interim agreement on the limitation of strategic arms.  Furthermore  the Soviet Union and the United States have reaffirmed the undertaking in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex] to pursue their negotiations to end the nuclear arms race and bring about actual measures of nuclear disarmament.2 The nuclear sponsors of the non-proliferation Treaty have a particular responsibility to adopt measures to curtail the nuclear arms race and thereby prevent further nuclear proliferation. One such measure would be a ban on all nuclear testing. Surely it is time for the two super-Powers to end underground tests  for the two States which continue to test in the atmosphere to cease their testing  and for a complete test ban to be concluded.29.	The international community has a right to expect that the agreements concluded in Moscow will open the way to more far-reaching nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. But it by no means under-estimates the historic significance of what has already been accomplished. Surely this amounts to a recognition that the search for a one-sided strategic advantage has become self-defeating and illusory and that the way ahead lies through a stabilized nuclear balance to nuclear disarmament itself.30.	In this same brief space of time to which I have referred  the People's Republic of China has  to Canada's great satisfaction  taken its rightful place in the United Nations. Relations between China and the United States and between China and Japan have witnessed a dramatic improvement. In Europe  breeding-ground of two world wars  the most significant steps in this generation have been taken to reconstruct relations between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and the German Democratic Republic  Poland and the Soviet Union on the other. The first general negotiations on co-operation and security in Europe since before the Second World War  as well as negotiations to bring about a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe  will soon begin.31.	Caution says of course that all these developments are only beginnings. But they could mark the greatest change in the international order since the United Nations was founded. If we are right to say that the United Nations reflects the international order on which it is based  can we be wrong to hope that these beginnings will sooner or later transform the United Nations as well? There are other hopeful developments. Dialogs have now begun between the two halves of Germany and Korea. These face enormous difficulties. But we can expect that in the not-too- distant future the universality of the United Nations will be strengthened through the extension of membership to the peoples of the divided countries. It will be strengthened also as self-determination brings the era of colonial empires to its final end  especially in Africa  where the most intractable problems of securing human dignity and freedom are posed. Although the recent proceedings of the Security Council give little support to the view  surely it is no longer visionary to conceive of situations in which the Council will function as was originally intended  by consensus of the permanent members and of the United Nations as a whole  through co-operation rather than through confrontation.32.	We founded the United Nations  as the Charter says  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". More has been accomplished in this past year to remove that danger than in any year since this Organization was created. Certainly so far as the risk of a general nuclear war is concerned  the hopeful evolution of great-Power relationships evokes deep feelings of relief  gratitude and satisfaction from us all.33.	It would be a bitter irony if the safer  saner world which seems at last a possibility rather than a dream should turn instead into a world in which the stream of violence simply cuts new channels.34.	Time and again  the smaller countries have called for an end to the nuclear arms race  an end to nuclear confrontation. We have sought an international order in which the great Powers conceived it neither as to their interest nor as their obligation to police the world. Now the great Powers  in their own interest and in the interest of us all  are moving in this direction. Is the new security and freedom which will thereby be available to all countries  large and small  to be dissipated in new forms of violence? Must we admit that only the fear of nuclear escalation has allowed us some limited success in the past generation in controlling recourse to force? Yet the international community still has no answer to the dilemma of deciding at what point local violence has such wide and obvious international implications that it can no longer be accepted as a purely domestic matter. We struggled with this problem last year during the crisis in Bangladesh. Even where violence is plainly international from the outset  our means of dealing with it are often pitifully weak. There are those in the world who appear to believe that the norms of civilized international life are not for them. They consider that they have a right to pursue their grievances by kidnapping  piracy  murder and wholesale terror and violence.35.	The problem is growing. It has become world-wide. My own country has had its tragic experience of violence of this sort. Canadians instinctively share the horror and shock which these acts produce wherever in the world they may occur. The Canadian Government understands only too well the agonizing choices Governments face when called upon to deal with a sudden nightmare of violence.36.	Terrorism takes many forms. It is called forth by a wide range of complex situations. The rights and wrongs of these situations are bitterly contested. It is simple realism to recognize all this. But the problem cannot be ignored because it is difficult. There must be no truce with terror. Some acts of terror are the work of deluded and demented criminals  others of frustrated and desperate men willing to sacrifice their own lives and the lives of innocent people in what they regard as a noble cause. When we agree that the cause is noble  we are tempted to condone the terror. But are we wise to do so? The act we condone today may be the one we regret tomorrow  when it is turned against us  for terrorism in the end affects everyone: it is an attack on civilization at large. Violence breeds violence  murder answers murder  and order dissolves in chaos.37.	Therefore  we approve the Secretary-General's initiative in seeking to have the subject placed on the agenda [A/8791 and Add.lJ. A number of delegations have reservations about the debate upon which the Assembly is to enter. Some fear it will be too diffuse to be useful; others that it will be too narrow to be constructive. It need be neither. The Canadian delegation looks upon the debate as a way to focus international concern upon the whole range of acts of terror and to stimulate action both by international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Red Cross and by Governments acting within their o vn powers or under bilateral agreements.38.	The means of dealing with the problem will be as varied as its forms. Some international legal instruments already exist for the purpose. Those should be quickly strengthened through ratification by as many States as possible. Perhaps new international machinery and new international legal instruments will be necessary as well. Then let us create them. How can the world  which has declared slavery  piracy and the drug traffic beyond the pale of civilized life  fail to outlaw terrorism? The Canadian Government  which has already amended its domestic law  entered into bilateral negotiations to limit terrorism in the form of hijacking and ratified the international conventions concerned  stands ready to contribute to the strengthening of international law to outlaw terror.39.	The task is formidable. But the United Nations has responded to challenges of equal difficulty in the past. Since we cannot expect national loyalties to disappear  we must work to temper those loyalties by a growing sense of responsibility on the part of individuals and Governments to the international community at large. I suggest that a consciousness of this responsibility is growing in ways unknown to previous generations.40.	Consider the field of human rights. It would be easy to multiply examples of violations of human rights throughout the world. The task of creating and ensuring respect for agreed international standards ha^ been daunting. Deep historic and cultural differences have produced widely differing views of the true source and proper extent of individual rights. Those differences are profound. How can we legislate them out of existence? Yet and I would draw this to the Assembly's attention the international community has successfully legislated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annex]. In doing so  it has recognized that there are limits to the exercise of State sovereignty and that certain rights attach to individuals among others  the rights to life and freedom  to liberty and personal security  to fair and prompt justice  to freedom of thought  conscience and religion  and the right to leave any country  including one's own.41.	The task now is to ensure that these rights are honored in practice. So far as my country is concerned  I am glad to say that the constitutional difficulties which have delayed Canadian ratification of the human rights Covenants are well on the way to being overcome. Through national experience and international example  Canadians have come to appreciate that the field of human rights is another sphere in which national and international obligations reinforce each other.42.	Among the most serious challenges to the honoring of human rights today are those that lie in Africa. In South Africa the very system of apartheid does violence to the concepts embodied by the international community in the two Covenants on human rights. In Rhodesia an illegal regime continues to deny the majority of its citizens even the hope of the basic rights to which they are entitled  and now  in Uganda  a new form of danger has arisen. I do not wish to enter into the substance of the question. Obviously  however  the situation in Uganda requires the exercise of the greatest restraint on the part of the Ugandan Government if the Asian community is to be allowed to leave in conditions of reasonable dignity and security. Humanity on the part of other Governments is required as well  so that the tens of thousands who may ultimately be affected by enforced expulsion may have a generous reception in the many countries of the world where their talents could find new and useful expression.43.	The great programs for economic co-operation' between the developing and the industrialized world are another instance in which a growing sense of obligation to the international community has become an expression of enlightened nationalism. The whole notion that this world venture should be undertaken at all has become part of general public consciousness only in the last 20 years. And once again those who are looking for reasons to be discouraged after a relatively brief effort find their case ready made. From the statistics of the first United Nations Development Decade we know that per capita incomes in the developed countries-already far higher than in the third world have been growing at not much less than twice the rate of incomes in the developing countries. We know that in the developed countries the consumption of energy per capita is 5 to 10 times the world average and that  quite apart from the difference in protein content  the intake of food in calories is almost twice as much per capita as in the developing world.44.	Those gaps are great. Some of them are growing. Meanwhile  the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their economies are partially absorbed in supporting populations which in Asia  Africa and Latin America are growing at the rate of between 2 and 3 per cent a year-double or more the rate for Europe and North America.45.	The resources devoted to attacking these problems of development and disparity are undeniably inadequate. If they are to be increased in quantity and quality the developing countries must continue their heroic efforts while the developed world finds ways of increasing the measure of its participation. The attack must focus equally on social issues  given the interdependence of social progress and economic growth.46.	In Canada  I am glad to say  sustained public consciousness of these problems has permitted the Government to make steadily increasing resources available for programs of economic co-operation. I expect this trend to continue. It will be combined with an intensified search to ensure that the co-operation is extended in the forms we are best fitted to provide and our partners are best fitted to use. Hand in hand with this will go measures to improve the terms on which the developing countries have access to our markets.47.	In economic relations generally  discouragement at some current tendencies would be justified. There is will an inadequate international framework within which to adjust the trading relations of the developed with the developing economies  and the market with the socialist economies. Among the major trading nations there are distressing tendencies towards protectionism  associated in part with the growth of trading blocs.48.	International monetary machinery labors under extra-ordinary strains and urgently requires strengthening. Yet all these problems are recognized. They are under repeated attack in the Economic and Social Council  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the International Monetary Fund  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  the regional economic commissions and elsewhere  and not without success. In the last analysis a sense of common purpose leads gradually to overcoming national differences.49.	If we wish to measure our progress we have only to recall the economic chaos of the period between the two world wars. Then rampant nationalism combined with economic ignorance to bring the world economic system down in ruins. How many of the political failures of that period can be traced to economic failures? For all their faults  the present world economic structure and the institutional framework for economic co-operation which has grown up under the United Nations are an infinite improvement.50.	But perhaps the most dramatic example of the rapid development of an international conscience and a sense of international responsibility concerns the protection of the environment. Even 10 years ago threats to the balance of nature were a matter for specialists. The public generally  and governments generally  were hardly aware that problems existed. In a matter of a few years we have awakened to the risk that we may be doing irreversible harm to the** natural order which sustains life upon the planet.51.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was the world community's first response to that challenge. It will undoubtedly take its place as one of the major conferences in United Nations history. Through its Declaration  the Conference has established a kind of ""environment charter""  providing a sound basis for the development of international environmental law and other co-operative measures for the protection and enhancement of the human environment. The recommendations for action agreed to by the Conference  demonstrate the willingness of Governments to work towards that goal. The endorsement of those recommendations consistent with the spirit and sense of purpose displayed in the Declaration will  in the Canadian view  be one of the major achievements of this Assembly  for the Stockholm Conference enunciated'.fundamental principles of international environ-mental law.52.	The international community now has an opportunity to make a further advance in strengthening the international legal regime as it affects the environment. This is in relation to the law of the sea. Canada  like many other countries  is in favor of convening the third law of the sea conference in 1973  but only if preparations are adequate. This will be possible if the sea-bed Committee  is able to hold two further sessions during 1973. Then the conference could be formally launched with an organizational meeting in the fall of 1973.53.	Those who wrote the Charter of the United Nations had certain clear ideas about what was needed to preserve international peace and security. They inherited some social  economic and legal machinery  and devised more. But the most foreseeing of them could not have anticipated many of the problems that have preoccupied the United Nations since. The whole range of exercises in peacekeeping; the transition to the post-colonial world; the machinery for economic co-operation between the developed and the developing countries; the extended protection of human rights; the work accomplished in relation to the environment  the sea-bed and outer space all these endeavors have called forth activity unimaginable in 1945.54.	In a remarkable way this Organization has risen to these demands. It has done so by creating a large and complex family of agencies-so large and complex  indeed  that strong administrative leadership is as crucial to the continued authority of the United Nations as political leadership itself. To ensure that the machinery functions at maximum effectiveness on a sound and equitable financial basis is a problem of the first order. The Canadian delegation will work to ensure that this problem receives the steady attention it deserves. Considerations of cost and complexity are  however  a reminder that a price has to be paid if the United Nations is to be flexible and dynamic.55.	I contend that it has displayed these qualities. The successive challenges of the last generation have been met with only two changes in the Charter: the increase in the membership of both the Security Council and of the Economic and Social Council. Apart from this  we have built upon the Charter machinery  giving a living interpretation to the Charter itself. While it has been difficult in practice to secure the required degree of agreement to amend the Charter  this does not seem to have prevented the United Nations from keeping up with the times. Canada is ready to look seriously at any specific proposals to amend the Charter or make it work better if these have broad support among Member States. But I am not convinced that a new Charter that could be agreed upon would be better than the Charter written in 1945.56.	I have struck a hopeful note  and I may be criticized for that  but I am convinced that this is the right perspective. We have to concentrate on the problems of the day. This Assembly will have to concentrate on measures to prevent terrorism  consolidate our first advance in the environmental field  secure administrative and budgetary reform  protect human rights in Africa and elsewhere  and develop international law  especially the law of the sea and the law governing air piracy. Meanwhile the Security Council may well be obliged to deal with threats to peace-for example  if the current tension in the Middle East rises dangerously. All these matters are sources of deep concern. To deal with them successfully to deal with them at all-will  we know  lead us at times into anger  frustration and despair.57.	It is therefore a healthy corrective to lift our heads above these problems on occasion  to remind ourselves of the great work the United Nations has accomplished in the past and to seek to trace those currents in human affairs which give hope chat its greatest accomplishments lie ahead."
"20",1246,"CHL",27,1972,"Mr. President  the delegation of Chile takes pleasure in congratulating this Assembly on its wisdom in electing you to preside over its deliberations. Your intelligence  tact and experience  which are necessary for such an important international post  have unanimously been recognized. Our pleasure is enhanced because there are strong ties of friendship and close co-operation between your country and my own.115.	We wish respectfully and warmly to salute the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim. We should like to convey to him our gratitude for his praiseworthy efforts to revitalize the United Nations so that it may more actively engage in the search for solutions to the many serious and urgent problems facing mankind today.116.	The Chilean delegation has considered with the greatest interest the Secretary-General's proposal for the inclusion on the agenda of this session of an item on terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l]. We have followed the debate on this subject with utmost attention. For reasons unconnected with the Secretary-General but having to do with the very nature of the phenomenon he has highlighted  the formulation of the item may be ambiguous and involve many contradictory issues  depending on the standpoint from which one approaches the problem. Hence the amendments that have been adopted and the need for a calm and exhaustive examination going to the very roots of the problem that each day assumes new and unforeseen dimensions.117.	The people and Government of Chile have expressed their sincere grief for the innocent victims of blind terrorism motivated by desperation  hatred or madness. Chile  whose Government rejects terrorism  is bringing about intensive social and economic changes within the free functioning of democracy. Nevertheless  as is well known to world public opinion  we have had to defend ourselves against international plots and sabotage that have tried to bring to our country coups d'etat  chaos and civil war. Had such sinister plans been successful  there would have been worse consequences for our people than international terrorism on a large scale.118.	We share the concern of many delegations that it might be possible  given the imprecision and vagueness of the term  to describe as terrorists the heroic fighters against colonial exploitation and shameful racism or those who legitimately rebel against oppression  injustice or poverty. Similarly  we should not like to see the adoption of measures against terrorism signifying an international coalition of reactionary forces against the progressive forces of mankind  nor should we like to see provisions hastily arrived at that would actually undermine the institution of the right of asylum  which has been upheld by Latin- American juridical traditions and has been an unchanging norm in the republican history of my own country.119.	Many of the causes of terrorism would be eliminated if there were respect for the principles of the Charter and self-determination  if there were no violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms  and if a responsible approach were taken to the tragedy of the growing impoverishment of the developing countries which  instead of being given co-operation  are being pillaged  boycotted and driven to desperation. The delegation of Chile is ready to participate in the examination of this item whose complexity should not be used as an excuse for not examining it dispassionately in all its aspects.120.	My Government believes that this session of the General Assembly is being held in favorable international circumstances  which augur well for a reduction of tension and the search for paths leading to real peace. Contacts and negotiations between great Powers  the beginning of dialogs which only a few months ago were difficult to imagine  and the emergence of a will to examine squarely the problems which constitute threats of hostility or confrontation have given birth to hopes which  we trust  will not fade or be disappointed.121.	It is a fact that by means of bilateral diplomacy the great Powers have made praiseworthy efforts to reduce their rivalries  thus making less likely a nuclear catastrophe. There are new prospects for disarmament  and there has been a reduction in the degree to which the world is divided into blocs. There is an increase in the possibilities of peaceful and active coexistence. There is emerging what the Secretary-General calls a new ""balance of caution""  which should replace the balance of power based on mutual nuclear terror  suspicion  rivalry and the arms race.122.	We welcome uie rapprochement of the great capitalist Powers and the great socialist Powers. It would certainly yield positive results for humanity if the capitalist world would decide once and for all to put an end to the policy of the cold war and to realize that socialism is an irreversible historical fact which manifests itself in various forms in accordance with the special character of the country adopting it.123.	We take great satisfaction in the fact that there has been a normalization of relations among all European States and that a system of security which strengthens the machinery of peace  channels the energies of those States towards scientific and technological progress and extends the benefits of such progress to the whole of mankind  and in particular to the countries which most need it  such as those of the third world  has been consolidated in that continent. But we are convinced that the thaw in international relations  if it is to be genuine and promising  cannot be something which exists only among the great Powers or in certain highly developed areas. Tension and threats to peace  the desperate situation of millions of human beings who are suffering from malnutrition  illiteracy  exploitation and imperialist penetration  violent or covert  often lead to tragedy in other parts of the world  specifically in Asia  Africa and Latin America  where we witness wars and coercion and where there are no signs of relief. That is where there is no perceptible relaxation of tension.124.	Paradoxically  along with the improvement in international relations  the aggression in Viet-Nam continues  as does the conflict in the Middle East  the subjugation of peoples in Africa and the exercise of pressure by imperialism in Latin America. We recognize as a real and historical fact the existence of great Powers with sufficient might to bring the world to the brink of destruction or to guide it towards peace  security and progress. Those Powers bear a special responsibility towards the peoples of the third world  who have been kept outside the mainstream of the progress of civilization.125.	If a great capitalist Power decides not only to avoid confrontation with other great Powers  but indeed decides to extend and increase its co-operation and trade with them while insisting on continuing its imperialist policy of exploitation and aggression vis-a-vis small nations which are jealous of their sovereignty  the relaxation of tension may be positive  but it can only come to full fruition if it is extended to all the peoples of the world.126.	There is something else we should add. Bilateral diplomacy is of the utmost effectiveness  but the results attained would be more tangible and beneficial if they were consolidated through the collective system so patiently worked out by the United Nations on the basis of international law  which develops in accordance with the requirements of justice for the whole of humanity. Nevertheless  we must condemn here the attempts made to invalidate the collective system of the United Nations  to deny it the resources and the means for its organs to discharge their functions of assistance to developing countries or  in brief  to diminish the prestige of our Organization so that it cannot really and properly participate in the political  economic and social leadership of today's world  whose problems require fresh vision and new approaches.127.	. My delegation cannot help referring to the tragedy of Viet-Nam. The Government and people of Chile reiterate their firm solidarity with the people of Viet-Nam  as well as with the peoples of Cambodia and Laos. We should like to express once again our condemnation of the bombings  the mining and the blockading of North VietNamese ports  the destruction of dikes and the so-called VietNamization of the war. An act of aggression is being committed against the people of Viet-Nam  which could be described as systematic and highly mechanized terrorism I repeat  systematic and highly mechanized terrorism which has produced innumerable innocent victims and has laid waste the entire country.128.	The peace in Viet-Nam so longed for throughout the world  longed for indeed by vast sectors of the public of the United States  can be achieved only by the total withdrawal of United States troops  the acceptance of the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam  and the respect of the territorial integrity and self-determination of all the peoples of IndoChina.129.	Certainly this General Assembly session  like so many others  will condemn colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid. The colonialist and racist countries continue to enjoy the support of certain Powers  in spite of resolutions of the United Nations. On the other hand  the resistance and liberation movements  which are opposed by modern armies and arms  do not enjoy sufficient support. It is impossible for Africa to realize its true potential for progress  unity and security  if in the southernmost part of that continent a colonialist and racist bloc is allowed to consolidate  a bloc which  with the complicity of imperialism  is entrenching itself and disregarding the agreements of our Organization.130.	Chile  as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  is following with great attention the contacts established between the Secretary-General and the Government of South Africa to clear the way for the final independence of the people of Namibia. However  we are surprised and disturbed at the fact that this Government  on the one hand  has welcomed the important initiative of the Secretary-General while  on the other hand  it pursues a policy of dividing the people of Namibia  persecuting its leaders and entrenching the evil system of apartheid  a crime against humanity which should of considered urgently in order to devise juridical instruments which would be binding on States.131.	My Government categorically supports the peoples of Africa fighting for independence and considers that the United Nations should intensify its decolonization activities  primarily condemning the colonialism and racism of Pretoria and Salisbury.132.	Still in the field of decolonization  as far as Latin America is concerned we consider it a memorable event of the utmost importance that the Special Committee on decolonization  should have decided in favor of ""the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV)"" [see A/8723/Rev. 1  chap. I  para. 85].133.	My Government regrets.that in the Middle East there has been no progress towards a just and stable peace. Indeed  a distressing sequence of events has occurred  including the massacres at Lod and Munich and the armed attacks in Lebanon and Syria. The occupation of Arab territories continues; the Jarring mission is paralyzed; and no real efforts are being made to gain respect for the lawful rights of the people of Palestine. We trust that this Assembly will reach more effective agreements in keeping with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Our Organization should actively work to end one of the most distressing tragedies of our time and one of the most terrible threats to the peace of the world.134.	Chile is undergoing intense economic and social changes designed to remove the outmoded and unjust structures of a society based on exploitation and to achieve socialism. This is a process designed to eliminate our dependence on imperialist monopolies and finances and in this way to bring about complete national independence. We do not conceal our difficulties and the desperation and hostility of reactionary forces which cannot reconcile themselves to the loss of their privileges.135.	In two years the Government of Popular Unity in Chile has brought about substantial changes in the life of Chile. We have nationalized our basic resources  copper  iron and saltpeter. We have eliminated large estates. We have nationalized and democratized the system of credit by making our bank State-owned. We have made progress in the area of social ownership  and we have included in this system very important monopolistic businesses. We have provided new educational opportunities and we have extended protection to the mother and child. Above all  the working classes have assumed responsibility and enjoy participation at all levels of the State.136.	Chile's experience  considered as one of the great social experiments in the world  is being acquired in respect for the constitutional and legal norms of our country  democratic pluralism and the free functioning of opposition forces. Much has been written and reported about the Chilean experiment  sometimes objectively but at other times obscurely and misleadingly. However  Chile is a country open to anyone who wants to understand the tremendous importance of the historic phase our people is passing through. We have nothing to hide  nor do we fear criticism. We simply want people to deal with us without mystification or falsehood.137.	Our foreign policy  rooted in the facts of our national life  is entirely in harmony with the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of this Organization. We have often given evidence in these two years of the Popular Government of faithful compliance .with principles such as non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  respect for the self-determination of peoples  human rights and peaceful coexistence  which transcend political or economic doctrines or systems.138.	Chile  which would appear to be cut off and remote because of its geographical position  has extended its network of international relations to all corners of the earth in the desire to establish bonds of friendship and cooperation with all peoples. Fundamentally  we proclaim that we belong to Latin America  and we are striving to achieve with all Latin American peoples not only profound friendship but genuine integration in various areas.139.	Our feelings of belonging to Latin America have inspired us to do everything we can to bring about the integration of Latin America. We are ready to seek alternatives and new possibilities within the Latin American Free Trade Association. In this context  we attach particular importance to the strengthening of the Cartagena Agreement of 1969  in which  along with Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador and Peru  we have succeeded in establishing a subregional plan of integration  and the progress we have already achieved is virtually irreversible. This is an example of integration which will surely have an impact on the entire region in keeping with our common destiny as Latin Americans.140.	We are full members of the group of non-aligned countries. Our non-alignment is not directed against any great Power. It is simply against the division of the world into blocs or spheres of influence. We want to contribute to the establishment of peaceful co-operation in keeping with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations.141.	With regard to progress towards a solution of the questions relating to the sea  my delegation considers that this session of the General Assembly should play a particularly positive role. The decisions which it should adopt with regard to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and the opportunity it will give to continue during this decisive phase the necessary political negotiations  encourages my Government to hope that the world Organization will demonstrate in this field its potential for resolving problems of interest to all States.142.	Chile takes particular satisfaction in the progress achieved towards the formation of a political plan for a solution. My Government believes that the growing support for the concept of zones of maritime jurisdiction of up to 200 miles  with an economic content  contributes in large measure to this plan  which should take into account the aspirations for justice and development of all peoples. The recent announcements  to this effect  of the States of Latin America  Africa and Asia  strengthen the economic interest of the countries of the third world  an interest which should be fully safeguarded if we want to achieve a global international solution.143.	My Government is concerned at the fact that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limit of national jurisdiction which was solemnly declared in resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly  along with the resources of the zone  to be the common heritage of mankind may begin to be exploited  in contravention of this declaration and what was known as the moratorium resolution [resolution 2574 D (XXIV)]. 144.	Chile has offered the facilities of its capital for the first session of the Conference  which it would like to be held in Santiago. I should like to express the thanks of my Government for the warm reception which this invitation received  in countries of all regions and systems  during the last session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. We are confident that this session of the Assembly will decide to accept the invitation. For Chile  a favourable decision would be a tremendous encouragement to its policy of negotiation and international co-operation  both in the Latin American sphere and on the world level.145.	We support the initiative of the Government of the Soviet Union in proposing as an item for this session the ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [A/8793]. We consider that an agreement on this subject  together with the convening of a World Disarmament Conference and the adoption of concrete measures to implement the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  will be positive contributions to the cause of world peace.146.	We oppose all nuclear tests  in whatever environment they are carried out. Chile witnessed with particular concern the continuation of the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere  in the Pacific Ocean.147.	The delegation of Chile has already had occasion to make substantive comments at the 1451st meeting of the Second Committee on the economic and social situation in the world and particularly on the external economic and financial relations of our country. Nevertheless  we consider it necessary to say  from this lofty rostrum  something about the principal aspects of our thinking with respect to these matters.148.	It is clear that the new manifestations of a relaxation of political tension also involve positive prospects for trade and economic relations at the world level. Nevertheless  it would be a bad mistake if these hopeful prospects were to reduce the deep concern over the world's plight brought about by the tragic economic and social conditions in which a large proportion of mankind lives.149.	We are witnessing events which are so dismaying to the third world that perhaps instinctively we tend to repose tremendous hopes in any positive sign offered to us. Our enthusiasm is great when there is some progress in the ruinous arms race  even though military expenditures continue to remain on the order of $200 000 million a year. We hear expressions of satisfaction at the steps taken to overcome the crisis threatening the world monetary system  although we are aware that this progress is very precarious and that it suffers from the fundamental shortcoming that in the formulation of the reform  which is under way  there is no part being played by the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China. It pointed out as an encouraging sign that in the last three years the per capita increase in production has reached a higher rate in the less developed countries than that recorded in the countries of the industrialized world  even though this fact clearly contradicts the projections of present trends  which show that there will be a continued increase  at an accelerated pace  of the widening gap between the standard of living of the third world and the standard enjoyed by the great capitalist  economic and financial Powers  which have already accumulated a disturbing proportion of the world's wealth.150.	Without doubt  one of the great problems of our time and the most critical and serious one which should be at the very forefront of the minds of world leaders is that created by the unjust international division of labour and the unjust distribution of income and the technological gap. Various studies have shown that if present trends continue  within 25 years the developed countries will be enjoying an income of more than $8 000 per capita per annum  while the impoverished masses-who by that date will number more than 2 250 million persons—will be earning on the average less than $200 per capita annually  and 800 million people will have an income of less than $100 a year. This is a problem which affects individual lives as well as the peace of the entire world.151.	The crisis of international economic co-operation is so acute that it would appear that some political leaders of the great Western Powers would prefer in fact to overlook the problem notwithstanding their many statements at meetings of international bodies.152.	With regard to trade  some important countries show no sign whatsoever of keeping the undertakings formally made with regard to the application of a general system of preferences. In the area of international financing we do not see here either any compliance with the principle of transferring at least the equivalent of 1 per cent of the gross national product to the developing countries. And in important cases we even witness significant reductions in the indicators of transfer  particularly with regard to public financial co-operation. This is happening while conditions in which international financing is granted are becoming ever less favorable and hence are leading to an accelerated increase in the servicing of the external debt of the developing countries. These payments are at the present time exerting almost intolerable pressure on the balance of payments of many of our countries.153.	Therefore my delegation considers that we should continue using and strengthening the instruments of international co-operation  particularly UNCTAD  whose third session we had the honor of playing host to in Santiago. In our view  this session  which was attended by more than 140 States  had the virtue of examining in depth the great problems of development and it proposed solutions which will be effective if the countries of the third world press for them in all international forums.154.	It was gratifying to our delegation  after having submitted to the Second Committee the evaluation and program of action prepared by the member countries of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination  to see that this evaluation and the statements made from this rostrum by the Foreign Ministers of Western European countries were very largely in agreement.155.	However  within this overall framework  which is in itself disheartening  there are particular circumstances which make more acute the problems of the external economic and financial relations of the developing countries. Chile in the last two years has had consistently to  confront these circumstances and for this reason we want to lay special stress on them on this solemn occasion. I am referring to new threats to the development and sovereignty of peoples first constituted by foreign attempts at economic coercion  aided and abetted by multinational corporations which operate beyond anyone's control and exert pressure to produce political decisions in behalf of the greatest world capitalist Power and which  in their desire to exploit the developing countries  carry out all kinds of illicit actions whenever the developing countries decide to recover their natural resources or those sectors of their economic activity which are of fundamental importance for the well being of their peoples.156.	The Government of Chile has carried out the nationalization of its principal resource  copper  with the unanimous support of the country  keeping strictly within the framework of our domestic legislation in accordance with the principles of international law emanating from resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Chile has acted in all its relations with external private interests in strict compliance with equitable and non-discriminatory juridical norms.157.	Nevertheless we have been faced with brutal financial and economic pressure  pressure exerted by some of the corporations affected by the sovereign decisions of the people of Chile. In various international forums  particularly at the third session of UNCTAD and at the last session of the Economic and Social Council  we have denounced the actions of which we have been the victim. We have indicated that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT)  even before President Allende came to power  initiated contacts with the Government of the United States and proposed various measures for intervention in our country  including the launching literally of a plan for a campaign of economic terror. This same international corporation  the ITT  subsequently  while rejecting a formal offer from the Chilean Government  which was known to the Government of the United States  to the effect that its investments in the telephone company of our country would be compensated in accordance with international standards  presented to high officials of the United States Government an action plan which involved the economic and financial strangulation of Chile and the overthrow of the Government democratically elected by the people of my country.158.	Recently  another multinational corporation  the Kennecott Copper Corporation  after being engaged in litigation for about a year with the Chilean State before the competent tribunal and because this tribunal did not grant its claims  initiated a campaign designed to obstruct free trade in Chilean copper in various markets  by means of public threats against purchasers of our copper and pressure exerted on commodity markets and brokers trading in this metal.159.	That was an attempt to prevent the people and Government of Chile from marketing its principal export product. Such actions violate the most elementary principles of international coexistence and  if not stopped immediately and responsibly by the Governments in question  will tend to create a climate incompatible with the kind of relations based on positive dialog which the Government of Chile wishes to maintain with the United States. Since over the past few days these reprehensible actions have been assuming even graver proportions  my Government reserves its right to raise these matters again in the General Assembly in the manner and at the time it deems appropriate.160.	We believe that there is an increasing awareness of the many serious problems arising both internally and in the sphere of international relations because of the actions of those large international corporations. Consequently  as we pointed out in our statement in the Second Committee  we hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will shortly  or in any event before the end of this session  report to us on steps already taken by the study group set up by resolution 1721 (LIII) of the Economic and Social Council  adopted by consensus  to study the role of multinational corporations and their impact on the development process  and also their implications for international relations  and to submit recommendations for appropriate international action.161.	The Government and people of Chile hope that the United Nations will soon set in train the appropriate measures to deal with the actions of the multinational businesses of which developing countries are the victims  and of which my country has been the principal victim without the international community having done anything so far to prevent such odious aggressive maneuvers. For its part my Government  in all international forums  will bring to the attention of the world  and will denounce  the attacks and subversive actions aimed at Chilean democracy perpetrated by those powerful imperialist interests.162.	Last week the representative of Chile at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  stressed that international finance organizations should not be the instruments of the bilateral policy of any member country of those institutions. We mentioned there that it was a well-known fact that there existed differences between the views of my own country and those of the United States Government with regard to the process of nationalizing our basic resources. We added that  although this was a fact  it did not authorize the United States to exert its powerful influence in the World Bank to get that agency of the United Nations to join in what was being done to put financial pressure on Chile by suspending its loans to our country.163.	Within the discouraging framework of international financing for developing countries  perhaps one of the few positive signs over the past few years has been the strengthening of multilateral approaches and the expansion of the operations of international financing agencies for development  such as the World Bank  the Inter-American Development Bank  the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Nevertheless  today the persistent efforts of many countries to strengthen the multilateral approach of those institutions are very likely to be thwarted by the actions of one Government which is bent on utilizing those agencies as instruments of its own bilateral international policy. It is unacceptable that people should try to justify a reduction in that Government's bilateral public aid to the developing countries by arguing that it is due to a desire to channel as high a proportion of resources as possible through multilateral organs  and at the same time should try to impose on each allocation of resources to those organizations restrictions and conditions which prejudice their independence and actually undermine their multilateral nature.164.	Since the coming to power of the Government of President Salvador Allende  Chile has received no new loans from the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank  agencies which up to that point had been granting an annual amount of financing to Chile on the order of $100 million. Clearly  this was not due to technical considerations  but to the decision made public by the United States to prevent such bodies from extending financial support to our country as a result of the differences of view existing between Chile and the United States over the nationalization of our basic resources.165.	For that reason we made the point at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that if some Governments were not capable of understanding the need to preserve the multilateral nature of international financing bodies it would be necessary to study new ways and means for them to acquire their resources: through compulsory contributions established according to the level of the gross national product of each country  or some other  similar scheme  in order to prevent a situation in which we find in each of the laws for the allocation of resources certain restrictions and conditions which in the final analysis only negate the international nature of those very organizations. We believe that here the United Nations also has an important role to play- particularly the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.166.	If we consider that there was an abrupt suspension of the foreign aid which Chile had been receiving during the 1960s from both public and private sources in the United States  as well as from international agencies of which Chile is a full-fledged member with all rights implicit therein; and at the same time  if we analyze the actions taken against our country by large international consortia  we cannot fail to recognize that Chile has been the victim of real economic aggression  which although it is less tangible than physical aggression  is no less reprehensible.167.	The balance of payments of Chile has been in a very difficult situation recently. This is due to the suspension of financing from certain external sources which have been traditionally available to Chile  and to a sharp drop in the price of copper and an increase in the imports which have been occasioned by great industrial activity and an increase in internal demand. Apart from this  another factor in our balance-of-payments position has been the increase in the international prices of products imported by Chile.168.	In the face of this situation  our Government  in order to maintain the normal functioning of the economy and  at the same time  to ensure payments for the servicing of the external debt to all our creditors  in accordance with the actual resources and possibilities of the country  decided at the end of last year to proceed to a renegotiation of this debt. The servicing of the external debt represented in 1972 an amount higher than 30 per cent of the value of the country's imports.169.	We should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Government of France for the important task that country has been carrying out as coordinator of the so-called Paris Club  through which last April a general agreement was reached to renegotiate the servicing of the debt for this year. Similarly  we are pleased to say that bilateral agreements have been reached with most of Chile's creditor countries  in accordance with the terms laid down in the general agreement of the Paris Club. At the same time  may we say that it is our desire to sign bilateral agreements as soon as possible with the other countries with whom we are at present negotiating. We hope  furthermore  that in the bilateral talks with our principal creditor country there will be no attempt to bring up issues which have nothing to do with the nature of those financial transactions  since this would only serve to hold up the settlement we all desire.170.	As the beginning of a new spirit in international relations is now perceptible we believe that the United Nations should be considered to be on the threshold of a new period of history. It must therefore be made a more dynamic instrument capable of meeting die needs of today's world. My delegation would like to stress that a real threat hangs over our Organization: people are trying to destroy its power  to drown it in fictions and deprive it of the authority which it must have in order to speed up the liberation and progress of the peoples of the third world.171.	No one can ignore the work done by the United Nations  but we should not underestimate the impatience and the skepticism of vast sectors of world public opinion over the passivity and ineffectiveness which the United Nations sometimes displays in its handling of the urgent and burning issues facing mankind.172.	But since the United Nations is not a super-national organization  nor does it have any autonomous powers which it can assume outside the body of States which compose it  its full authority can only be brought to bear through the determination of all its Members to respect common obligations and to take collective action  by taking up within it the tragic problems afflicting mankind  by making its working methods more flexible  by increasing its financing capacities and by broadening its power and action.173.	The United Nations has made progress with regard to the matter of universality  particularly with the inclusion of the People's Republic of China something which was so indispensable for our Organization but there still remain nations and peoples which should come into the United Nations as soon as possible. My delegation would like to mention particularly the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. Both German States are indispensable components of a system of European security. Their scientific and technological achievement are extraordinary and their participation in the United Nations would be a powerful shot in the arm. We should also like to mention Bangladesh  divided States like Korea and VietNam  and peoples who possess a national identity  but have not succeeded in becoming nations or States due to their subjugation to the colonial yoke.174. Thanks in large measure to the action of progressive farces  the United Nations has succeeded in containing many crises; it has contributed to the independence of many peoples; it has promoted juridical  economic and social progress. But now more than ever we have the duty of strengthening the United Nations until responsible international conduct becomes the norm  until selfish interests ire set aside  until neo-colonialism and imperialism are done away with  until  in a word  a new form of international law which is at once more just and more effective is enshrined.175. The Government of Chile expresses its confidence that this session of the General Assembly will work in a spirit of understanding  with a firm and renewed will to reach agreements which will actually be carried out and make a genuine contribution to the struggle of peoples to enjoy full justice  peace and human dignity."
"21",1292,"CHN",27,1972,"A number of important changes have taken place in the world situation since the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. A series of new victories has been achieved by the Asian  African and Latin American peoples in their struggle to win and safeguard national independence. Countries of the third world are getting united on a wider scale to oppose the super-Power policies of aggression  expansion and war; they are playing an ever greater role in international affairs. Meanwhile  some important events have taken place in international relations. In the East  the leaders of China and the United States have held talks after more than 20 years' suspension of relations between the two countries. They have made clear the differences of principle between the two sides and agreed that countries  regardless of their social systems  should handle their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  non- aggression against other States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence  and that international disputes should be settled on this basis  without resorting to the use or threat of force. Recently  Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan paid a visit to China  and the two sides have reached an important agreement on the normalization of the relations between China and Japan  thus realizing the long-standing aspirations of the two peoples and opening up a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. In the West  the Soviet Union and the United States held summit talks and signed a number of bilateral agreements on co-operation in the fields of science and technology  culture  education and health. The European Economic Community has grown and expanded. In the Middle East  far-reaching progress has been made in the Arab nation's struggle to free itself from super-Power control. The struggle of the people of various countries and the changes in international relations have helped in varying degrees to promote the relaxation of international tension.141.	However  it cannot but be noted that there is no essential change in the situation in which a super-Power is pushing expansionism by all means in contending for world hegemony. The acute and complicated contradictions and struggles between imperialism on the one hand and the oppressed nations and peoples on the other have not abated.142.	To this day  the United States war of aggression against Indochina is still going on. Because of the meddling by the Soviet Union  the turmoil on the South Asian subcontinent has failed to subside. The stalemate of ""no war  no peace"" in the Middle East remains. In Europe  with the two military blocs confronting each other  there is no genuine security and cannot be any. Colonialism of different forms persists in many parts of the world. The sovereignty and independence of many small and medium- sized countries are still being infringed and their national resources plundered. Twenty-seven years have elapsed since the end of the Second World War. There are still foreign military bases of various kinds and large numbers of foreign troops on the territories of many countries. The arms race between the two super-Powers is being stepped up unceasingly  seriously menacing the independence and security of the peoples of the world. The whole Western world is in the grip of financial and monetary crises  which have aggravated its various contradictions. In these circumstances  how can the world not be in turmoil? The world is still in the process of great turbulence  great division and great realignment. The struggle between aggression and anti-aggression  interference and anti-interference  subversion and anti-subversion  control and anti- control is bound to continue for a long time.143.	The Chinese delegation holds that the people of all countries must not be deluded by certain temporary and superficial phenomena of detente at the present time and develop a false sense of security. While striving for world peace and the progress of mankind  we must maintain sufficient vigilance and make necessary preparations against the danger of new wars of aggression any imperialism may launch.144.	To end the war in Indochina as soon as possible is the most urgent matter for easing the tension in the Far East. At present  the people of the whole world  including the American people  strongly condemn the United States Government for its wanton bombing  mining and blockading of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and resolutely demand that it immediately stop all its acts of aggression against Viet-Nam and the whole of Indochina and withdraw all the armed forces of the United States and its followers  so that the peoples of the three Indochinese countries may solve their own problems independently  free from any foreign interference. Fair and reasonable ways for the peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam and Indochina question have been put forward in the seven- point proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the elaboration on its two key points and in the Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the IndoChinese peoples in April 1970. Of late  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam issued a statement on 11 September demanding that the United States cease its policy of ""VietNamizing"" the war and supporting the Saigon puppet regime  and pointing out that a solution to the problem of South Viet-Nam must proceed from the actual situation in South Viet-Nam  in which there exist two administrations and two armies as well as other political forces  and stating that a provisional government of national concord composed of three equal segments must be formed to take charge of affairs in the period of transition. This proposal is fair and reasonable. It shows that the VietNamese side has no intention of imposing a Communist regime on South VietNam. Rejection of this proposal precisely bespeaks the attempt to continue to impose the Nguyen Van Thieu puppet regime on the South VietNamese people. The Chinese Government fully sup-ports the just stand of the VietNamese people and of the three IndoChinese peoples.145.	The three IndoChinese countries are close neighbors of China  and the three Indochinese peoples are the Chinese people's brothers. We are duty bound to support them in their just struggle against foreign aggression  and we will never interfere in their internal affairs. On behalf of the Chinese Government  I once again solemnly declare from this rostrum: so long as the war in IndoChina goes on in whatever form  the Chinese Government and people  not flinching from the greatest national sacrifice  will firmly support the three IndoChinese peoples in fighting to the end.146.	It is necessary to point out here that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  Head of State of Cambodia  is the sole legal representative of the Khmer people and effectively controls nearly 90 per cent of Cambodian territory. The Lon Nol regime is imposed on the Khmer people by foreign forces  and it is illegal from the very beginning. The representatives of the Lon Nol clique have no right to occupy Cambodia's seat in the United Nations. More and more countries in the world have recognized this reality and truth. The Chinese delegation holds that the United Nations should rectify the present unreasonable and illegal state of affairs and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its lawful rights.147.	On 4 July this year  initiated and promoted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  North and South Korea reached agreement on the principles and steps for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  thus strengthening the confidence of the 40 million and more Korean people  who have been divided for 27 years  in the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland. The Chinese Government and people warmly welcome this agreement. Nineteen years have elapsed since the armistice in Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea as early as 1958. But in South Korea there still remain a so-called ""United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"" and a so-called ""United Nations Command"". This is an anachronism. The combination of the two implies a threat to North Korea. This is an underlying factor making for the continuation of tension on the Korean peninsula. Now  North and South Korea have agreed to achieve gradually the reunification of Korea independently and by peaceful means without reliance upon foreign forces or interference by them. Why should the United Nations keep these two stumbling blocks in front of the Korean people? The General Assembly should discuss the proposed item ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea"" [A/8752 and Add.1-10] and adopt a pertinent resolution to remove these two stumbling blocks. It is regrettable  however  that the discussion of this fair and reasonable proposal has been deferred to next year. To dodge a problem is no solution. It is argued that the discussion should be postponed to next year because North and South Korea are now in contact. This argument is untenable. One may ask  will there be no more contacts between North and South Korea next year? This is obviously a pretext. A postponement is neither in the interests of the Korean people nor conducive to relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula. We hope that the countries concerned will reconsider their stand.148.	Now I wish to speak on the question of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. We all remember that last December  in this very hall  the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session [2003rd meeting] adopted by the overwhelming majority of 104 votes a resolution calling for cease-fire and troop withdrawal by India and Pakistan [resolution 2793 (XXVI)]. Subsequently  the Security Council also adopted  by 13 votes in favor and 2 abstentions  resolution 307 (1971) which demands a ceasefire  troop withdrawal and release of prisoners of war by all those concerned. However  while the relevant resolutions of the United Nations were not yet implemented  the Soviet Government and its followers raised at the Security Council last August the question of the admission of ""Bangladesh"" into the United Nations.  In disregard of the reasonable demand of many countries to postpone the consideration of the question  they insisted on a vote to compel China to use the veto. China's stand for postponing the consideration of this question does not mean that we are fundamentally opposed to the admission of ""Bangladesh"" into the United Nations. China cherishes friendly sentiments for the people of East Bengal and has no prejudice against Mr. Mujibur Rahman. We stand for postponing the consideration of this question  in order to promote a reconciliation among the parties concerned and the implementation of the United Nations resolutions  which are the very immediate concern. However  the Soviet Government has hurriedly pressed for the admission of ""Bangladesh"" to the United Nations. This is definitely not aimed at helping ""Bangladesh""  but at forcing China to use the veto  maintaining and aggravating the tensions among the parties concerned on the subcontinent and whitewashing its foul act of supporting the Indian Government in dismembering Pakistan last year. But its attempt will not succeed. If it had been national self-determination  it should have been the people of East Bengal solving their problems by themselves. Why should Indian troops have invaded East Pakistan? And why should the 90 000 and more Pakistani war prisoners and civilians have been taken to India?149.	After the admission of ""Bangladesh"" has been vetoed  certain people are trying to bypass the Security Council and refer the question to the General Assembly for discussion. This is clearly done with ulterior motives. This will in no way help promote a reconciliation among the parties concerned on the subcontinent  nor will it reflect honor on the country inciting such a move. China stands firm on principles. China considers that the question of whether or not reasonable United Nations resolutions supported by the overwhelming majority of its Members are implemented is a matter of principle affecting what direction the United Nations is heading for. And on matters of principle China will never retreat.150.	The present situation of ""no war  no peace"" in the Middle East is solely created by the two super-Powers for their respective interests. Taking advantage of this situation  these two super-Powers are using Arab countries' territories and sovereignty and the Palestinian people's right to existence as so many stakes with which to strike political deals. The United States is openly supporting the aggression by Israeli Zionism. The other super-Power claims to ""support and assist"" the Arab people in their struggle against aggression. Has it supported and assisted them? It has indeed sold them no small amount of weapons. But strangely  the weapons supplied are not allowed to be used. Is this not asking people to buy scrap iron? Moreover  it demands privileges and bases  and even attempts to subvert their Government. What kind of ""friend"" is this? It is more dangerous than an open enemy.151.	However  recent developments show that the heroic Arab people will not allow others to ride on their backs and lord it over them for long. They have taken determined actions to shake off super-Power domination. This commands admiration. Do not believe the sensational nonsense deliberately spread by a super-Power that no counter-attack should be made against Israel's armed aggression for that would spark a world war. That is meant to scare people. It has been borne out repeatedly by the history of the 20 years and more since the Second World War. We believe that  so long as they strengthen their unity and persevere in their struggle  the Arab countries subjected to aggression are fully capable of recovering their sacred territories and the injured Palestinian people of regaining their national rights.152.	The Chinese Government has always opposed assassination and the hijacking of individuals as a means of waging political struggles and is also opposed to adventurist acts of terrorism by individuals or by a handful of people divorced from the masses  because they are harmful to the development of the cause of national liberation and people's revolution. But we strongly condemn Israel for the recent barbarous aggression and massacres it has committed against Lebanon  Syria and other Arab countries on the pretext of the ""Munich incident"". The Chinese people will always stand together with the Arab and Palestinian peoples in their just struggle against aggression.153.	The situation in the Mediterranean is closely related to that in the Middle East and Europe. In contending for hegemony  the two super-Powers have dispatched large numbers of war vessels to the Mediterranean and set up many military bases there  posing a threat to the security of the countries around the sea. Now more and more Mediterranean countries have raised their voices for ""a Mediterranean of the Mediterranean countries""  and demanded the withdrawal of foreign fleets from the Mediterranean. Their demand is entirely just and the Chinese Government and people firmly support it.154.	It is fully understandable that the peoples of the European countries  who have gone through two world wars  are all concerned for the peace and security of Europe. Twenty-seven years have passed since the end of the Second World War  and yet many European countries are still under the military control of one super-Power or the other  with large numbers of foreign troops stationed on their territories. Making use of the confrontation of the two military blocs  each of the two super-Powers is trying hard to keep its allies under control and undermine the opposite side. In these circumstances  how can one speak of genuine peace and security for the people of the European countries? What calls for attention is the fact that there are now some people who  capitalizing on the European people's eager desire for peace  are trying hard by various tactics to cover up the reality that European peace and security are still under threat  and to create the false impression of a European detente and ""all quiet on the western front""  so as to attain their ulterior purposes. The fact that a super-Power could  when it considered it necessary  launch a surprise attack in order to occupy an ally with massive troops shows that such a ""military alliance"" is no guarantee of peace at all. Security is out of the question for any country when it is under virtual occupation.155.	We hold that  in order truly to ensure peace and security for Europe  it is necessary to oppose firmly aggression  interference  subversion and control by the super-Powers  to disband military blocs  to withdraw foreign armed forces and to bring about peaceful coexistence between the European countries on the basis of respect for independence and sovereignty  mutual non- aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. Otherwise  the so-called; European security conference can only be another name for the division of spheres of influence between the two super-Powers by making use of military blocs. Such a conference would better be called ""the European insecurity conference"" rather than ""the European security conference"". An increasing number of countries are demanding that all the European countries should take part as equals in the European security conference and its preparations with equal powers and opposing the holding of the conference as between two blocs. They especially oppose the two big Powers monopolizing everything behind the backs of the other countries and manipulating the destiny of their people. This is an expression of the profound aspirations of the European people. The Chinese Government and people resolutely support the people of the European countries in all their efforts to oppose the power politics and hegemony practiced by the super-Powers.156.	In Africa  particularly in southern Africa  the mass movements against white colonialist rule  racial discrimination and apartheid and for national liberation have made great new progress  marking a further enhancement of the political consciousness of the African people. The people in southern Africa and other regions which have not yet achieved independence are increasingly aware that the only way to overthrow white colonialist rule and win national liberation is to rely mainly on their own efforts  fully arousing and organizing the masses and waging an unyielding and valiant struggle. It is necessary to seek external assistance  but more and more facts have proved that it is impossible to put an end to colonialist rule by relying on other people. The Chinese Government and people resolutely support the heroic people of Mozambique  Angola  Guinea (Bissau)  Azania  Zimbabwe  Namibia and Spanish Sahara. Their struggles are just  and so long as they carry on perseveringly  fear neither hardship nor sacrifice and advance wave upon wave  they will surely  with the sympathy and support of the peoples of Africa and the whole world  win final victory.157.	As a developing country  China  from its own experience  fully sympathizes with the deep aspirations of the Asian  African and Latin American countries for the defense of their national independence  the protection of their resources and the development of their national economy. We resolutely support the Latin American countries in their struggle to defend their 200-nautical-mile maritime rights. We resolutely support the petroleum and other raw material exporting countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America in their struggle against plunder by foreign forces. We resolutely support the developing countries in their struggle to prevent imperialist countries shifting their economic crisis on to them. We resolutely support the small and medium-sized countries in their struggle against big Powers plundering their fishery resources.158.	We hold that  in order to change the backward state of their economy  the developing countries should first of all rely on themselves; that is  they should rely mainly on their own efforts and take foreign aid as an auxiliary. The just struggles of the people of all countries support each other. Those countries which have already won liberation are all the more duty-bound to support and assist those countries subjected to oppression and aggression. But now some people are using aid as a means for controlling other countries and expanding their own spheres of influence.When they give something to other countries  they assume the airs of a benefactor and demand all sorts of privileges. They send to the recipient countries experts and advisers who behave as tyrants  ordering people about and lording it over them. How could this be called aid?159.	We hold that all countries which are sincere in providing aid to others  including multilateral aid through the United Nations  should help the recipient countries and not exploit them. Their loans should be interest-free or  at least  low in interest. They must not press for repayment but should allow its postponement. When providing a loan or other forms of aid  they should strictly respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries  attach no conditions and ask for no privileges. The purpose of providing aid to other countries should be to help the recipient countries stand on their own feet and to develop an independent national economy. They must not reduce the recipient countries to dependence and subordination in the name of ""economic aid"" or ""the international division of labor""  still less place them under their control on the pretext of ""aid"". China  too  received some foreign aid in the past and had direct experience in this regard. Therefore  today when we provide aid to other countries  we endeavor to act on the above-mentioned principles. Of course  our capabilities in this respect are limited and the aid we can give is not much. But we hold that the above-mentioned principles should be propagated and applied universally.160.	Now I wish to speak on the question of disarmament. Not long ago some agreements on the limitation of strategic armaments were reached by the Soviet Union and the United States in high-level talks. There is no need for us to comment on these agreements if they are regarded merely as bilateral affairs between the Soviet Union and the United States. But if they are being blown up as tremendous achievements on the road of reducing the threat of nuclear war  we cannot agree. These agreements only stipulate some limitation on the quantity of certain categories of nuclear weapons in the possession of the Soviet Union and the United States  but impose no limitation at all on their quality  nor do they mention a single word about the destruction of nuclear weapons. This can by no means be regarded as a step towards nuclear disarmament. On the contrary  this marks the beginning of a new stage in the Soviet-United States nuclear arms race. Before the ink on the agreement had dried  the one hastened to test new-type nuclear weapons and the other expressed its intention to make a big increase immediately in its military expenditure. How can this be described as reducing the threat of a nuclear war? We hold that no fond illusion should be cherished about these agreements. In 1921  the major naval Powers of the time prescribed a limitation on their respective total tonnages of capital ships  and the limitation was reaffirmed in 1930. Everybody knows what happened in the end. It is not without meaning to recall this historical case today.161.	Moreover  the Soviet Union and the United States have stated in the document on the basic principles of relations between them  that they have a special responsibility to avert conflicts which would serve to increase international tensions  and they have recognized each other's security interests based on the principle of equality. What special responsibility and what equal security interests? According to Khruschev's ""theory""  do they not stand for Soviet-United States collaboration for world domination? Of course  one can talk like that  but it would not be so easy to have it realized.162.	As everyone knows  war is the continuation of politics. The invention and the development of nuclear weapons have not changed  nor can they change  this truth. Although no new world war has occurred since the Second World War  local wars of various types have never ceased. Why? Because imperialism resorts to armed force in carrying out aggression and expansion. Where there is oppression there is resistance  and where there is aggression there is struggle against aggression. This is inevitable so long as imperialism exists. But now the Soviet Government asserts that in a nuclear age there is no other way than that of peaceful coexistence among States  which presupposes  above all  the renunciation' of the use of force in international relations  that is  the non-use of both conventional and nuclear weapons. It has even spread the alarmist theory that the destructive power of even conventional warfare has by now increased so greatly that the large-scale use of conventional weapons can lead to the annihilation of entire nations. But the world will be safe once there is a resolution on the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. This is a sheer hoax. As a matter of fact  the Soviet Government does not believe in its own theory. Its practice in the Middle East  where it gave weapons to Arab countries but forbade the use of them  does smack a little of this ""theory"". Yet  in the Indo-Pakistan war last year  it gave undisguised support to the Indian Government in its armed aggression against Pakistan. What kind of non-use of force is this?163.	People condemn war and consider it a barbarous way of settling disputes among mankind. But we are soberly aware that war is inevitable so long as society is divided into classes and the exploitation of man by man still exists. There are two categories of wars  just and unjust. We support just wars and oppose unjust wars. If a socialist still wants to be a socialist  he should not oppose all wars indiscriminately. The non-use of force in international relations can only be conditional  and not unconditional. The condition is to realize peaceful coexistence through mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  and equality and mutual benefit. And in order to realize this  it is imperative to oppose the policies of aggression and expansion of any imperialism. When imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism of various descriptions are still using force to enslave  commit aggression against  control and threaten a majority of the countries of the world  it is betrayal to the people of the world to advocate non-use of force in international relations indiscriminatingly  without regard to conditions and in an absolute way. If one still has a grain of socialism in him  why does he not produce something presentable for instance  opposition to aggression in international relations  and especially aggression backed by nuclear weapons? Why should he  on the contrary  choose to produce such shabby stuff as renunciation of the use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons? In that way  does he not allow himself to be seen through right away?164.	Permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons this sounds so nice and looks so much like China's proposition  but in fact it is completely different. We say that  as the first step towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons  agreement should first be reached on the non-use of nuclear weapons. And we have publicly declared that at no time and in no circumstances will China be the first to use nuclear weapons. This fully shows that China is developing nuclear weapons for defensive purposes and with the aim of breaking the nuclear monopoly and proceeding from there to eliminate nuclear weapons. If the Soviet Union entertains the same defensive purposes as it has claimed  why does the Soviet representative not dare to come up to this rostrum and make a similar declaration? How can it make people believe its big talk in favor of the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons to be sincere when it  while mouthing the word ""prohibition""  is constantly brandishing its nuclear weapons  obdurately opposing the possession and development of nuclear weapons by countries with few or no nuclear weapons  feverishly improving and developing its own nuclear weapons and deploying them at the gates of other countries? It asserts that the renunciation of the use of force and prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would be effective only when the two are linked together. In actuality  this is demanding that the people of the world give up their armed struggle against aggression; otherwise  nuclear weapons will be used against them. Is this not its plain logic? Big talk is useless. The proposal of the Soviet Government  no matter how much it is couched in diplomatic language  has the real intent of making all oppressed nations and peoples tamely submit to the nuclear threat of the one or two super-Powers. But they have grossly underestimated the political consciousness of the people of the world.165.	In order truly to do away with nuclear threats  it is necessary to completely prohibit and thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons. Yet the Soviet. Government dares neither to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons nor to touch on the question of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons  but advocates the cessation of all nuclear tests. Why? As everyone knows  the Soviet Union has made hundreds of nuclear tests. When it had made enough tests in the atmosphere  it proposed the partial ban on nuclear tests. Now when it has made enough underground tests  it calls for a ban on all nuclear tests. Actually this means that the Soviet Union could make any kind of tests when it had the need  and that when it no longer has the need the others are not permitted to make any test. This is another trap blatantly designed to maintain its nuclear monopoly  following the partial nuclear test-ban treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. As a Chinese saying goes  ""The magistrates are allowed to burn down houses  while the common people are forbidden even to light lamps."" China absolutely will not fall into this trap. At no time and in no circumstances will China recognize such a right for the Soviet Union or any other nuclear Power. No one but those Powers alone are permitted to develop nuclear weapons; they may threaten others but others are not allowed to exercise the right of self-defense. Can there be such reason on earth? At present  a mere cessation of all nuclear tests without complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons can only hinder countries with few or no nuclear weapons from developing their nuclear capabilities for self-defense but will not affect in the least the nuclear hegemony of the super-Powers. The real purpose of the proposal of the Soviet Government is to maintain its nuclear monopoly and nuclear superiority by capitalizing on many countries' legitimate desire for peace  so that it can have a free hand to carry out its nuclear threat and nuclear blackmail against countries with few or no nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are something which people can neither eat nor wear. China is a developing country and certainly does not want to spend one penny more than necessary on such stuff. China is making nuclear tests under compulsion. Its nuclear tests are taking place in its deep interior  and their number is limited. China is ready at any time to stop all its nuclear tests  but only on the day the nuclear weapons of the nuclear super-Powers and all nuclear countries are completely prohibited and thoroughly destroyed  and not before.166.	On the question of convening a world disarmament conference  we have explained the position and views of the Chinese Government at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly [1983rd and 2022nd meetings]. We cannot agree to the Soviet position on the ""world disarmament conference"" as set forth in the Soviet Foreign Minister's letter of 14 August this year [A/8757] to the United Nations Secretary-General. The ""world disarmament conference"" as proposed by the Soviet Union has neither the necessary requisites nor a clear aim. It would in fact be an ""empty-talk club"" which would indulge in far-ranging rambling discourse without solving any practical problem. To hold such a conference would only serve to hoodwink and lull the people of the world. It is better not to hold it.167.	The actual situation in the world today is this. The two super-Powers are maintaining military bases of various kinds  including nuclear bases  and stationing large numbers of their armed forces  including nuclear-missile forces  in many countries; their airplanes  warships and submarines  including those carrying nuclear weapons  are flying and plying everywhere; and they have up to now refused to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  particularly not to use them against non-nuclear countries. To varying degrees  all the countries in the world with no nuclear weapons and those with few nuclear weapons are exposed to their threat. The most urgent question today is the withdrawal of foreign armed forces  rather than the reduction of armaments. Let the two super-Powers withdraw all their armed forces  both conventional and nuclear  back to their own countries. If they do not even want to effect a withdrawal  how can one believe that they are willing to make an arms reduction?168.	The cry for general and complete disarmament has been going on for more than a dozen years. But the result is general and complete arms expansion by the two superPowers  while all the small and medium-sized countries of the world are in a position of defense inadequacy. This hoax should not be allowed to continue. In order that a world disarmament conference will make a true start and carry on fruitfully instead of becoming a bout of deceptive empty talk  it is imperative to create the necessary conditions for the convening of such a conference  namely  all nuclear countries  particularly the Soviet Union and the United States which possess the greatest amount of nuclear weapons  must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons  and that they not only will not use nuclear weapons against each other  but  more importantly  will not use them against the non-nuclear countries  and they must withdraw from abroad all their armed forces  including nuclear missile forces  and dismantle all their military bases  including nuclear bases  on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible to create the necessary conditions for all the countries  irrespective of their size; to discuss and solve on an equal footing the important questions of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and the reduction of conventional weapons.169.	Since the beginning of this year  the United Nations and its Security Council have done much work thanks to the joint efforts made by the overwhelming majority of the Member States. What merits special mention is that the Security Council held special meetings in Africa on African questions. This was an unprecedented action taken at the demand of many African countries. The meetings adopted a number of useful resolutions on some African questions. At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in the capital of Chile  many developing countries forcefully exposed the situation in which certain developed countries  by trade  tariff  monetary and other means  are monopolizing international markets  shifting their economic crisis onto  and stepping up the plunder and exploitation of  other countries  thus aggravating the irrational international phenomenon of ""the rich becoming richer and the poor poorer"". The developing countries strongly demanded that this state of affairs must be changed. At the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in the capital of Sweden  many countries of the third world strongly condemned imperialism for carrying out policies of aggression and war and put forward a number of sound views and reasonable opinions on the question of conserving and improving the human environment. At the sessions of the sea-bed Committee  many countries of the third world carried out resolute struggles to safeguard their own natural resources and upheld the just position that each country has the right to determine the scope of its own territorial sea and jurisdiction. At all these meetings and conferences  many countries of the third world showed their firm determination to oppose imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism and played important roles.170.	However  we cannot but point out with regret that owing to obstructions by the one or two super-Powers the United Nations has remained weak and ineffective in dealing with many major international issues. Some correct resolutions adopted by the United Nations remain unimplemented due to hindrance by one or two big Powers. Many organs and agencies of the United Nations are still dominated by a small number of countries and fail to reflect the demands and opinions of the great number of countries of the third world. In the United Nations there still prevails the very serious phenomenon of discussions without a decision and decisions without implementation. All this should be corrected speedily.171.	Here I wish to deal with the Chinese Government's views on the review of the United Nations Charter. As is known to all  the United Nations Charter was drawn up near the end of the Second World War and it was a product of the historical conditions prevailing at the time. However  history is making advances and things are developing. In some respects the Charter formulated 27 years ago obviously cannot meet the tremendous change that has occurred in the international situation and in the United Nations. There were 51 original Members at the founding of the United Nations. Since then more than 80 countries have joined the United Nations  most of which are newly independent countries. It is understandable that there is a demand for the United Nations Charter to reflect fully the present state of affairs in the world. We maintain that on the basis of upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter careful consideration should be given to the views of various countries for necessary revisions of the Charter so as truly to give effect to the principle that all Member States  big or small  are equal. Of course  we likewise consider that the revision of the Charter is a serious and important question  and we are ready to join you all in serious explorations.172.	The world is at the cross-roads  and so is the United Nations. If the United Nations is to regain its prestige and play its due role  it must conform to the trend of the world  truly express the just demands of large numbers of its Members and the people of the world  act strictly in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and free itself from manipulation and control by the big Powers. It must be trustworthy in word and resolute in deed. Otherwise  it would be very difficult for the United Nations to avoid eventually taking the old path of the League of Nations. The Chinese delegation is ready to work together with the delegations of all countries which love peace and uphold justice to make the United Nations truly capable of playing a role in safeguarding international peace and promoting the cause of the progress of mankind."
"22",1338,"CIV",27,1972,"I am happy  Sir  to express to you the warm congratulations of the Ivory Coast delegation upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-seventh session.82.	At the same time I take great pleasure in expressing our gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  who presided with the authority and competence we all recognize here over the deliberations of the previous session of the General Assembly.83.	I should also like to take this opportunity to repeat to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our warm congratulations on his appointment to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations. I should like to assure him that in the performance of his important and delicate task he can always count on the support and understanding of the Government of the Ivory Coast.84.	The last eight months have been marked by intensive activity in the most widely varied fields. If we cannot but deplore the absence of positive results  both in terms of development and in peace in regions of conflict  we are obliged to recognize  however  that a new wind has been blowing on the international political scene.85.	The journeys of President Nixon to the People's Republic of China  of President Bhutto to Simla  of Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka to Peking and of Chancellor Brandt to Moscow and East Germany are the most marked features of the change which has occurred in international relations. Similarly  the ratification of the Soviet-German and Polish-German agreements  the moves towards rapprochement between the two Koreas and the striking manifestation of reconciliation and solidarity which marked the ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Rabat  show that a climate of international detente is reigning.86.	This climate of detente  which our Secretary-General quite rightly has described as ""a historical development of the highest importance"" [Al8701/Add.l  p. 1]  has been made possible because responsible men  like President Nixon and President Bhutto  Chancellor Brandt and distinguished Heads of State of Africa and Asia  have chosen  without inhibition  to have recourse to dialog in order to resolve delicate situations which seemed insoluble. The results achieved demonstrate once again that the policy of dialog  which engenders tolerance and understanding- understanding which facilitates coexistence  the last stage of the process of exchange which is a true golden rule for a world which wishes to survive-remains the most effective  the most humane and the most reasonable method of resolving differences.87.	In his message to the nation on 7 August last  the Head of State of the Ivory Coast  President Felix Houphouet-Boigny  stated:""One of these hopes and you are aware  my dear friends  how much I cherish it-is that of seeing dialog  something which the Ivory Coast has always indefatigably championed  becoming finally the uncontested and general rule in our world  so that in order to prevent and to resolve conflicts of all kinds  hate  fanaticism and blind violence can give way to a spirit of co-operation which would be sincere and very widely shared.""But Heaven knows the extent to which fanaticism and violence have given us  and alas are still giving us  distressing examples of their pernicious effects.88.	On the world chess-board the Middle East has become an important piece in the fluctuating  equivocal and doubtful policy' of the Member States  in particular the great Powers. The extremes of yesterday no longer exist  but the situation remains dangerous and explosive. For more than 20 years  at each of our sessions  the parties to this conflict have been vetting and scrutinizing our slightest gestures and every word we utter. Our Assembly is finally awake to the mass of innocent deaths resulting from acts of violence and repression  which are tragic episodes in a strategic war which reminds us if there is any need of this-of the existence and the persistence of a kind of slow-motion war. Our reaction is then to vote for one more resolution  with the easy conscience of a good craftsman doing a good job. But the reality is painful; it is no piece of fiction. We are plunged into a tragic atmosphere resulting from a refusal to undertake dialog. And thus the time has come when the disappearance of hope leaves us nothing more than shattered dreams and impotent resentments. Yes  indeed  the time has come when men  feeling themselves abandoned  isolated  betrayed and hunted  have no further recourse but irrational violence.89.	We must recognize that in this tragedy the conduct of the United Nations has been far from being exemplary. Now  things happen quickly and politics tolerates only success. Are we to continue to display such an extreme of impotence? We do not think so. We believe that we must seek to determine the causes of our failure in order to bear them in mind when advocating more realistic approaches to the problems of this region  whose essential elements are the occupied territories  the refugees and the state of belligerence. Solutions are possible if we make up our minds to rid ourselves of our prejudices  if we bridle our passions and if we place above our own interests those of the peoples concerned. The memorandum of the 10 African statesmen   prepared to contribute to the solution of the problem and based upon the principles I have just mentioned  has been totally disregarded  and we can only regret this.90.	We are particularly saddened by this tragic situation. We think that peace is possible by a recourse to dialog.Since 1963 the Ivory Coast has been advocating this in the Special Political Committee. My country believes that this earth  where man has given his life for other men  his brothers  is not doomed to hatred  war and carnage  but that  on the contrary  its destiny is to become a place of reconciliation  peace  love and fraternity.91.	Security Council resolution 309 (1972)  charged the Secretary-General with a mission to contact with South Africa. This contact  the dialog for which the Ivory Coast cherishes a veritable passion through loyalty to the cause of its struggling brothers of southern Africa  which it knows to be just  constitutes a new approach in the search for a solution to the problem of Namibia.92.	The success of this undertaking  which would finally afford us a glimpse of the dawning of an era of fraternity and understanding among black and white Africans  depends upon the abandonment of the idea of the partition of Namibia into small nations  which simply should be thought of as one of the minor and outmoded stratagems of the colonial power of yesterday.93.	The mission of the Secretary-General constitutes  in this context  the test of the goodwill of the Government of South Africa. We therefore await with interest the report of the Secretary-General  and we presume that the South African Government is undoubtedly aware of the grave consequences of a failure of this mission. For our part  let us display the greatest goodwill. Let us be patient  let us exhaust all the possibilities offered by this approach before any rupture takes place. What is at stake for Africa is of the most vital importance.94.	In southern Africa the situation therefore remains extremely disturbing. The majority of the people of Zimbabwe has rejected the Douglas-Home/Ian Smith agreement of November 1971   and hence no progress has been achieved. The illegal regime profited from an easing of sanctions and noted with satisfaction the official lifting of the embargo on certain strategic supplies. Here again we are faced with a situation which is only too familiar  that of the ineffectiveness of sanctions  which are never applied because they are thwarted by the narrow  selfish interests of States.95.	At the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa the African group insisted that the administering Power should convene a constitutional conference to lay the bases for a settlement of the situation and a transfer of power to the majority.96.	We consider that  after the veto ""cast by the United Kingdom at the Security Council's 1666th meeting  the General Assembly should deal with this item at this session and exert pressure upon that Government to take the measures necessary to remedy the illegal and dangerous situation prevailing in the Territory bearing in mind the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Zimbabwe.97.	As for the African Territories under Portuguese domination  their destinies are dear. The colonial war being waged against them is only a distressing phase. The Portuguese army is fighting the inevitable. Those Territories will be independent. It is simply a matter of the inexorable course of history and the unshakable and invincible will of their peoples  a will manifested in the actions of the nationalists.98.	In order to preserve its African image  like other former colonial Powers Portugal has no alternative but a fruitful dialog with the nationalists. If it refuses and persists in propagating the fiction of ""Portuguese overseas provinces""  it will know the solitude of those who sow death and then undergo irreparable disaster on our continent.99.	We have asserted from this very rostrum that Portugal's future in Africa is tied to its recognition of the right of all Africans to independence. The problem is simple and has one solution the independence of these Territories in friendship with the former colonial Power. If it rejects that  it thus rejects any prospect of having any future in Africa.100.	The Ivory Coast's policy is to contribute to creating an atmosphere that would make it possible for the administering Power to get a better insight into the realities of today's Africa  an Africa aspiring to its own identity.101.	In Viet-Nam  the situation seems to be frozen. Men  women and children by the thousands are falling victims to the principles of those who are supposed to guide their destinies. The main victims are the masses of the dead  the wounded  the mutilated  and the families in mourning. The principal victors are the armaments industries of the various countries supplying arms. The halting of hostilities and subsequent self-determination and neutrality seem to be the necessary pre-conditions for a final settlement of the VietNamese situation if we want to end the terrifying spectacle of dual intransigence causing so much havoc in the Far East.102.	It is because we believe in the virtues of dialog in settling problems and the most difficult of situations that we hope positive results will be forthcoming from the secret conversations now going on simultaneously with the interminable Paris conference.103.	Ten years have elapsed since the first Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. One meeting after another is held  and the examination of the budgets devoted to arms unfortunately indicates that the target of general and complete disarmament belongs only to the very distant future.104.	However  partial progress has been achieved in this last decade  and it should be credited to our Organization. This initial progress can open up prospects of fruitful debate which will make it possible to reach general agreements within the framework of a world conference on disarmament. We consider these agreements to be indispensable if we want once and for all to banish the specter of war and give human beings enough time to devote themselves to the magnificent task of human solidarity.105.	The first United Nations Development Decade is dead. The Second United Nations Development Decade  hardly born  is already in its death throes. We prepared for the great conference in Santiago  Chile.  We took an active part in it  and our final disappointment was commensurate with the hopes we had cherished for it  hopes so cruelly dashed.106.	The gap between the rich and the poor is growing endlessly. ""Assistance""  this formula associating the words ""give"" and ""receive""  has been substituted for the genuine co-operation that should have been established between nations. This assistance is inadequate  and the rich countries providing it cannot increase it because of opposition from their own citizens. Indeed  the taxpayers involved are less and less willing to have their precious money  as they see it  going to fill the coffers of States they cannot even find on the map of the world. But we  the poor nations  know that our salvation lies  not in the policy of the outstretched hand  which is repugnant to our dignity  but in just and equitable remuneration for our primary commodities  the fruit of our own labors.107.	Meeting here are the rich and poor countries constituting the United Nations. We have a more accurate view of matters. We are not unaware that primary commodities  be they mineral or agricultural  are the"" principal and sometimes the only resources of developing countries and that a decline in terms of trade is inevitably to the detriment of those commodities.108.	The loss sustained by the countries of the third world has been estimated at $1 300 million annually for the period 1965-1967. Today  in spite of UNCTAD that figure amounts to between $3 000 million and $4 000 million.109.	The import taxes levied by industrialized countries on primary commodities coming from developing countries contribute-sometimes substantially-to the budgetary resources of the rich countries. It is quite clear that the countries that profit so much from international trade are hardly likely to question existing machinery.110.	When  in August 1971  a crisis broke out in the international monetary system  the problem of the development of the poor countries became a secondary matter. The rich countries  and in particular the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  found it too easy to conclude that they were the only countries concerned in the crisis and did not even think about its grave repercussions for the countries of the third world. Nor do they think about them now.111.	That was noted with some bitterness by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD  who on 23 December 1971 stated:.. development of the 'third world' [has become relegated] to that of being a casual by-product of output and demand in the industrialized countries.""112.	Meeting in Santiago  Chile  in the spring of this year  the third session of UNCTAD did nothing to repudiate that assertion. In analyzing the disappointing conclusions of that session  President Houphouet-Boigny quite rightly wondered:""Who would dare to express satisfaction at the results of the third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which has once again seen the expression of the impotence of the poor and the lack of conscience of the rich. As for the most essential problem  that of primary commodities  it was in fact not really faced and was subsumed in the recommendations to the World Bank  which  we fear  in this matter as indeed in others  will simply be added to the interminable list of wishes which are as pious as they are innumerable.""113.	I shall conclude by stating that it was most illusory to expect any results from that session: in fact  the intransigence and insensitivity of the affluent countries are equaled only by the arrogance of their wealth in the face of the demoralizing impotence of the poor countries.114.	That is the situation at a time when our Organization wants to achieve the objectives of the Second Development Decade.115.	However  the financial resources made available up to now to the third world by the rich countries represent only half of what had been provided for  while at the same time the servicing of the debt of the poor countries has increased more than twice as fast as the export resources which were to finance that servicing. This tragic situation has led distinguished economists to raise objectively a question which should be of concern to us  ""Who is helping whom? ""116.	However  and without any real reason  we are searching the dark skies for some chances of success for this Decade. Those chances might be transformed into reality if the affluent countries were willing courageously and honestly to reflect in actions their goodwill that is to say  if they were to set in motion a policy of co-operation on a world scale which would permit  inter alia  the stabilization of commodity prices and the development and universalization of a system of preferences without reciprocity or discrimination  to abolish in their own countries restrictions on manufactured articles exported from developing countries  and gradually to transform the codes which at present govern shipping.117.	But those chances would become certainties if the poor countries  heeding the logic of facts  were finally to realize the imperatives of the situation  which make it necessary for them to put an end to their sterile competition and try to form themselves into groups of primary commodity producing countries in order to acquire the weight and the necessary influence and importance to discuss the points at issue on an equal footing with the consumer countries.118.	Our countries were not born to independence in order to die of it. Our countries were able to put up a magnificent fight for political independence  and surely they can do so in the struggle for their economic well-being. They do possess resources of energy  courage and determination  which can work miracles when put to the test.119.	Only progress based on the efforts on the part of all  rich and poor  will give to all the peoples of the world reason to believe in peace and in the reality of a better life on our human planet.120.	As for the problem of the environment  the philosophy of the Ivory Coast in this regard is that of most developing countries. We therefore give priority to development rather than to the protection of the environment as the rich countries conceive of it. In Stockholm   in the name of ecology  we were shown a picture of the future which would not be so splendid: pollution. But what pollution is there that is more dangerous  more destructive of civilization  than that of poverty  misery  disease  lack of hygiene and ignorance? However  those are so many scourges  and men of goodwill in their altruistic campaigns are meeting with refusals on the part of the affluent countries to do anything-about the cycles of production and well-being  for the benefit of everyone. For us  indeed  an improvement in our standard of living is inherent in human nature and its measurable reality remains our principal target; The Government of the Republic of the Ivory Coast thinks that a more profound knowledge of the environment should in fact be a concern of life and that the environment should be dealt with in the light of its human goals and targets. That is why we should not  in our view  contemplate this matter only from its biological  technological or scientific standpoint. We should study it as the problem of life  embracing all of life's aspects  political  cultural  economic  social. In this way we should have a clear and global insight into the ecological and social imbalance  a source of inequity  alienation and anti-social conduct.121.	Our Organization has the essential task of bringing about peace  and the health of the world. The international relaxation of tension which has now been observed should not lead to. a relaxation of vigilance. We fear that the position adopted by certain States in the budgetary area will lead to new difficulties  and may cause a new financial crisis  such as we have already witnessed  with the risk of paralyzing once again the functioning of the United Nations.122.	In spite of the criticisms which various people may have had and may still have with regard to the functioning of our Organization we are all aware that it does have the extraordinary merit of existing. Its importance in the solution of social  cultural and economic problems existing in the world should not be underestimated. Its shortcomings are essentially political.123.	The Organization still remains the best long-term chance which the international community has to ensure its survival and justice and progress  with the effective participation of all nations. It remains noble in its task of active solidarity and generous in the granting of its aid and it would stand to gain a great deal by remaining pure in its political activities.124.	Before leaving this rostrum I should like to assert once again the attachment of the Republic of the IvoryCoast to the United Nations  to its Charter and its principles  and also the absolute belief that we in the Ivory Coast have in its future  because whatever the multiplicity of our convictions there remains one cause to be defended: peace."
"23",1373,"CMR",27,1972,"Mr. President  since I am speaking from this rostrum for the first time as the head of my country's delegation  permit me first of all to convey to you my warm and sincere congratulations and the congratulations of the entire Cameroon delegation on your brilliant election to the Presidency of this Assembly. This choice is a just tribute to your distinguished statesmanlike qualities and to your long and rich experience of international problems. It testifies to the high esteem in which your country is held by the world community. We are convinced that under your enlightened guidance and with the continuing co-operation of all those around you  and particularly the members of the General Committee  whom we associate in this act of tribute  our work will be as successful as we hope.63.	I should also like to associate myself with previous speakers in conveying our gratitude and thanks to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  for the skill and competence with which he presided over the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly one year ago.64.	We should also like to welcome the presence at your side of Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  whose understanding of the complex problems of our day and valuable experience in the field of multilateral diplomacy permit me to predict that the difficult problems confronting our Organization will be pursued and dealt with competently and effectively.65.	Having lived for so long in a world where the apprehensions created by the rivalry between the great Powers have generated the fear that at any moment large-scale conflicts might break out  we have just witnessed signs of the relaxation of tensions in international relations. This year in the course of a few months we have just lived through historic moments characterized by contacts which would formerly have been deemed to be impossible between the great Powers. These encounters have been followed with interest and much hope by the international community as a whole  and should be greeted as the dawn of a new era.66.	The restoration to the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights in the United Nations and the summit meetings between the United States and China  on the one hand  and the Soviet Union and the United States  on the other  are evidence-that positive developments are occurring in the relations between the great Powers. For its part  Cameroon  which has a standing interest in international peace and security  is gratified at these felicitous initiatives.67.	Similarly  we note with a great deal of optimism the ratification of the treaty of 12 August 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  the treaty of 7 December 1970 between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland  and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971. We believe that these agreements have removed a major obstacle to East-West relations.68.	These signs of an easing of tensions have created conditions favorable to the search for a solution to the problems of divided countries through direct and independent negotiations between the parties concerned.69.	We may thus hope that the two Germany and the two Koreas will finally in the not too distant future be in a position to redefine the course of their own destiny.70.	But along with these positive aspects  we are unfortunately constrained to note that these efforts on the part of the great Powers have not yet led to a general easing of tensions. If peace is indivisible  detente  understanding and co-operation should also be indivisible. However  that does not seem to be the case for the moment.71.	Indeed  in Viet-Nam the war is continuing. We in the Cameroons have never ceased to express our indignation at the long war thus imposed upon that country. The courage of the people of Viet-Nam  their patriotism and their determination to be independent have earned them the admiration and support of the international community.72.	More than 10 years of fighting involving the great Powers directly or indirectly  and to a lesser degree the rest of the world  thousands of millions of dollars poured out by both sides  about a million soldiers confronting each other in the field  tons of bombs dropped every day: is not all that enough to cause the parties involved in that distressing conflict finally to give serious thought to reaching a negotiated solution which will enable the great people of Viet-Nam to devote themselves to the building of their destiny in independence and peace?73.	There is no question that all the proposals and programs put forward by the parties directly concerned do contain some positive elements  and we for our part are convinced that with a minimum of mutual trust  and good-will on both sides  it should be possible to make substantial progress at the Paris peace talks.74.	The situation in the Middle East  the cradle of so many brilliant humanistic civilizations and the treasure house of so much natural wealth  is of equal concern to us. Five years have elapsed since the adoption of the Security Council resolution on the Middle East which gave rise to such great hopes; nevertheless the solution seems as uncertain as ever. Indeed  Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the elements which constitute an acceptable basis for carrying forward negotiations between the parties to the dispute with a view to achieving a just and lasting peace in that part of the world.75.	The United Nations in general and the great Powers in particular should spare no effort to try to restore peace to that part of the world  which is so dear to our hearts.76.	My delegation is deeply convinced that all these situations of tension and confrontation which have been of concern to us for so many years would be completely eliminated if the policy of natural supremacy and egoism pursued by certain great Powers with their pernicious effects of material and ideological domination  could cease.77.	That is why we unreservedly support the collect position taken by Ministers for Foreign Affairs of non- aligned countries who  when they met in Georgetown  Guyana  from 8 to 11 August 1972  reaffirmed their devotion to peace and called for the immediate democratization of international relations which would guarantee peace to all States  large and small  and would respect their natural right to participate freely and equally in the common search for solutions to the great problems of the world.78.	Cameroon will therefore tirelessly continue to seek world peace and to oppose with increasing determination all forms of aggression as well as the threat or use of force against the freedom  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. My country  with growing determination  will support the struggle of all peoples against colonialism and racial discrimination  which are a denial of the equality and dignity of man.79.	It would be ungracious of us not to recognize the interest which the United Nations as such has always shown in the problems of the liberation of the African countries which were subjected to colonial oppression and racial discrimination.80.	How indeed could it be otherwise  since this Organization was born of the will of a group of men determined to put an end for all time to the wrongs engendered by the denial of freedom and equality to all men?81.	There is no need to recall the long list of resolutions which have been adopted in this area  both by the General Assembly and by the Security Council. But we must stress two acts which have engendered so much hope among the oppressed peoples of Africa. I refer  first of all  to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. Then there is the welcome accorded by the General Assembly to the Manifesto on Southern Africa [resolution 2505 (XXIV)]  which the Head of State of Cameroon  in his capacity as the then President of OAU  had the privilege of presenting from this very rostrum. 82.	These two documents contain all the principles whose implementation should be ensured by the international community to remedy a situation which is clearly deteriorating and jeopardizing more and more each day the conditions necessary for the maintenance of peace.83.	Since our last session  the minority and racist regimes which are oppressing millions of men in southern Africa have only further strengthened their hateful system. In South Africa repression has been intensified: priests  professors  journalists and students by the hundreds are crowded into the gaols of Pretoria. Everyone is aware that that country has the largest prison population in the world and also holds the infamous world record for executions. Far from being upset by this  the white minority which holds sway in Pretoria is even extending its Nazi-type system beyond its frontiers  in particular  to the international territory of Namibia  and is strengthening its administration there  despite the repeated appeals of the General Assembly and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice given last year.84.	We should like to take this occasion to state that we have followed with much interest the efforts of the Secretary-General to discharge the exceedingly difficult mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council. We are bound to add  however  that for us there can be no compromise or concession on the question of the dignity and freedom of peoples. Any steps must be directed towards persuading the racist Government of Pretoria to withdraw from Namibia and replacing the illegal South African occupation by the administration of the international community with a view to preparing the people of Namibia for self-determination and independence.85.	Throughout the previous session we  together with the other African delegations  tried in vain to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the tragicomedy which was being rehearsed in Rhodesia. There was talk then of negotiation with the racist rebel regime in Salisbury. Hence it was with indifference that we witnessed the failure of an undertaking which had been marred by injustice and immorality from the very outset.86.	The people of Zimbabwe  which some believe have no voice  did in fact make themselves heard unambiguously despite countless acts of intimidation and repression. It is with the representatives of this people that negotiations should be held on a footing of equality in order to reduce the tension prevailing in that area.87.	The United Kingdom  which has in the past given so many examples of its devotion to freedom and to the rights of peoples  should today have a clear awareness of its responsibilities to the people of Zimbabwe. It is for that Government to take effective measures to enable that people to exercise their inalienable right to sovereignty. Such measures require no special study because they should simply follow the democratic process which has been repeated so many times by the United Nations  namely: first  the restoration of all democratic freedoms and the release of the African militants; secondly  negotiation with the nationalist leaders representing the majority of .he people of Zimbabwe; thirdly  submission of the terms of the agreement to the universal suffrage of the entire adult population of Rhodesia  under the supervision of the United Nations; and fourthly  no independence before the setting up of a government chosen by a democratically elected majority.88.	If these principles are not respected  we can be sure that the people of Zimbabwe will have no recourse but to pursue with even greater vigor the course of violence taken by frustrated peoples  with the help of the OAU and with the assistance of all freedom-loving peoples.89.	We are also aware that such a warning has but little chance of being heard by the racist forces of Salisbury  since they draw their inspiration directly from the principles and methods of blind Portuguese colonialism.90.	Portugal  which would be better off devoting its resources to the prosperity of its own people  for more than 10 years now has been stubbornly pursuing a genocidal war although it knows that war is doomed to failure. Furthermore  feeling the ground crumbling under its feet  as was demonstrated by the special mission sent to Guinea (Bissau) from 2 to 8 April 1972 by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is making crude attacks on independent African countries  and is also engaged in installing millions of new settlers in Cabora Bassa.91.	We cannot cease stressing the heavy responsibility for this criminal enterprise that is shared by certain Powers. The sordid commercial ties between these Powers and the oppressors of African peoples in fact constitute the principal factor delaying the victory of the just cause of the freedom-fighters.92.	That is why Cameroon will not hesitate to intensify the moral and material assistance it is providing to the African liberation movements in order to offset the persistence of colonialism and the cynical reinforcement of racial discrimination.93.	The efforts of the international community to tackle jointly  through the organs of the United Nations system  certain major economic problems of the day relating to trade and development  the international monetary crisis and the environment  because of their importance and their long-term effects  merit particular attention.94.	In this area there have been two recent developments: the third session of UNCTAD held at Santiago  Chile  in April and May of this year  and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June.95.	Everyone agrees in recognizing that the third session of UNCTAD did not yield the hoped-for results despite extremely thorough preparation for the work and the huge organization  which was practically perfect; credit for this of course goes above all to the Government of Chile and to the secretariat of UNCTAD.96.	We must recognize that the paucity of results is owing primarily to the highly negative attitude of the rich countries  which share the primary responsibility for this failure. To the rightful claims of the countries of the third world they adopted an attitude of deplorable selfishness. As a result of the third session of UNCTAD we must record an atmosphere of despair which may poison relations between the third world and the developed countries. True  the richer countries undertook to associate the third world with the forthcoming monetary and trade negotiations; they also agreed to grant special assistance to the 25 developing countries which are identified as the least developed. But the great problem of stabilizing commodity prices was left unsolved  as was that of access of manufactured goods to the markets of the developed countries.97.	It is true that in this area of international trade relations vast interests are at stake. It is also true that these problems can only be solved over the long term. We must also deplore the lack of cohesiveness in the group of under-developed countries and the lack of any strategy. The fact remains  however  that the essence of the unsolved problems will be taken up at subsequent conferences  for which thorough preparation must be made  taking into account the experience we have gained. For its part  Cameroon will strive to give its utmost support to UNCTAD and to the forthcoming negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] with a view to eliminating tariff barriers. In this regard  we hope for the co-operation of GATT and UNCTAD with a view to reaching solutions likely to satisfy the countries of the third world.98.	We also place much hope in the negotiations on the International Cocoa Agreement  which is a strategic commodity for some countries  including Cameroon.99.	The outmoded Bretton Woods monetary system has been so severely criticized that my delegation will not dwell on the process of collapse which has afflicted it since its creation.100.	With the collapse of this system  new solutions must be found  but with the co-operation of all those who are affected by this monetary system during great crises. The whole world knows that the developing countries have paid a very heavy price as a result of the successive devaluations of the so-called strong currencies  to such a point that the increased participation of these countries in discussions with regard to monetary reform has proved indispensable.101.	Despite their hesitation at the early stages of the preparation for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  the African countries finally made a positive contribution to the work of that Conference.102.	The developing countries have acquired an increased awareness of the problems involved in improving the human environment.103.	In so far as concerns the United Republic of Cameroon  a knowledge of the natural environment and in particular its effects on the problem's of health  hygiene  and housing is a matter of high priority. Similarly  the safeguarding of the environment for the well-being of mankind requires that remedial action in the management of natural resources must be taken here and now. In saying this  we wish to emphasize our interest in anything which concerns the problems of the environment.104.	We are happy to note that problems of development have been kept constantly in mind by the representatives of the 114 countries participating in the Stockholm Conference  and we hope that  whatever the forum  those problems will be mentioned at any meeting convened to give further consideration to this burning problem.105.	The picture which we have just sketched of the international situation in the world today contains many dark spots and the conditions in which we are living  despite a tendency towards a relaxation of tension  are unfortunately still far from encouraging.106.	The principles of equality among States  respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States are little respected throughout the world.107.	Racial discrimination and colonialism of the most backward kind continue to devastate the African continent  despite the condemnation of world morality.108.	Lastly  inequality persists in international economic relations  widening the gap which separates the developed nations from the under-privileged nations.109.	These various aspects of the world situation today make of inestimable value the search for peace. Whether bilaterally  within OAU  or at the level of the United Nations  my country has constantly worked  within its means  to find a solution to the problems which create tension. We shall continue along this course and we hope that peace  which is mankind's most precious asset  will prevail.110.	This hope  although not a certainty  rests on certain recent changes in the international climate.111.	There is no doubt that these positive developments in the international climate will lead to a realignment of relations among States both in the political area and in the economic field.112.	This is the conviction which guides us and the groups to which my country belong  namely  the group of non-aligned countries at the political level  and the Group of 77 developing countries at the economic level. The Cameroons remains solidly aligned with these groups  which represent the developing countries.113.	In the world of today peace  security and progress are achieved through the democratization of international relations.114.	This assertion  which emanates from the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  is worth thinking about. The Foreign Ministers of this group  who met at Georgetown last August  noted the development of an expanding multi-polar system which will replace the present division of the world into two antagonistic blocs. They also noted that  in the course of this evolution  new centers of power are appearing  while at the same time the aspirations of many countries to independence are being reaffirmed. We note that this analysis coincides with that which the Secretary-General of our Organization expressed recently  when he gave what we consider a valid opinion on the very concept of the Security Council itself. At the conclusion of his analysis he stated:""The interests  the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot  at this point in history  be ignored in any durable system of world order."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 2.J115.	That means that in order to bring about peace  true peace  we have no choice but to appeal to all nations  large and small. As the Head of State of Cameroon has said:""What we must do is to build upon the material solidarity of mankind a moral solidarity based on common values build a universal civilization based upon the original and unique contribution of each people. That being said  it is not surprising that the foreign policy of the Cameroons is based upon the dual principle of peace and international co-operation with all nations of the world without discrimination. That concept provides our non-alignment one of its corner-stones  which reflects the will of my country to participate  in freedom  in the building of the common destiny of mankind."""
"24",1414,"COD",27,1972,"It is customary at this time of the year for this glass and steel palace in Manhattan to play host to the meetings of special envoys who come from the four corners of the world and to offer the opportunity to international public opinion to hear speeches setting forth the positions of Governments on the economic and political problems of mankind.92.	As special envoy of General Mobutu Sese Seko  I come to this rostrum of the United Nations and before this unique forum to present the views and considerations of the Popular Movement of the Revolution  our great national political party  and the National Executive Council of the Republic of Zaire.93.	A certain tradition has been established in this hall placing political problems before economic problems  and especially development problems. In the Republic of Zaire  where a great revolution is occurring  we place the problems of development  and especially of our economic revolution  in the forefront.94.	Whatever the degree of political maturity of a people  its effective independence can be expressed only by the control of its economy.95.	For us  nations of the third world  the Bandung Conference  hurled a challenge to the colonial system. Thus  from the Bandung Conference to the Georgetown Conference   our various States have all fallen prey and will continue to fall prey to all kinds of disturbances as long as they are not masters of their own economies. To remedy this situation  the international community took the initiative in 1964 in Geneva of starting round-table negotiations to denounce the plundering of our wealth.96.	Despite an abundant amount of literature disseminated all over the world on the danger represented by the gap between the so-called developing countries and the so-called developed countries and despite negotiations within specialized bodies  no solution seems likely to be achieved to fill this gap. Can one talk of international peace when over two thirds of mankind languish in poverty? There is not the slightest doubt that the road to lasting peace in a community is through the solution of economic problems.97.	The gap which separates the economies of the developed countries in the Republic of Zaire we call them ""the equipped countries"" from those of under-equipped  or underdeveloped  countries comes from the bad structure of the international economy. The result is that on the one hand some cannot enjoy the advantages of the present international division of labor and on the other hand international assistance gives rise to problems which do not seem to be finding proper solutions in the present state of affairs.98.	To prevent delays in this fight against under-equipment as in the solution of important problems of structure in the international economic system of today  the Republic of Zaire has decided to count above all on its resources and secondly on all-round co-operation with all other peoples  taking into account its own interests. Zaire is convinced that the reform of the structures of the international economy can be achieved  not around a conference table  but rather through events resulting from the internal dynamics of these structures. Aware of this situation  my country has embarked upon a policy of reform of its economic structures. Through these reforms the Zaire economy will first have to be oriented towards the internal market  and then it will have to be able to make possible economic integration  and the agreements which the Republic of Zaire has just concluded with some African countries prove our political will to achieve regional economic integration.99.	Here I should like to point out that  instead of merely abandoning its project for the construction of the Inga hydro-electric dam  which had not aroused any interest on the part of equipped countries and the international bodies approached for financing it  the Republic of Zaire decided to build it with its own resources  come what may. It was only when this work was quite advanced that some foreign interests did come forward to co-operate with us. In a few weeks we shall inaugurate one of the greatest hydro-electric dams in the world  whose construction was made possible solely due to our own will.100.	I must also point out the important economic agreements concluded by two African countries whose independence in the matter of political and economic decisions is clear for all to see. I have in mind the Republic of Zaire and the Republic of Guinea. These agreements were reached in Conakry between President Ahmed Sekou Toure and General Mobutu Sese Seko during the fraternal and unforgettable visit which our national leader paid to the African land of Guinea. This proves that the economic integration of the under-equipped countries is predicated  above all  on their own will.101.	The Republic of Zaire  unfortunately  knows that  if it is rare for industrialized countries to agree even after marathon negotiations  it is just as rare for under-equipped countries to achieve a harmonization of their views on matters of common  albeit vital  interest and here we can only blame ourselves.102.	We must have the courage to recognize that political will alone is not sufficient for achieving this integration. Under-equipped countries further require the technological and financial co-operation of the equipped countries  although this co-operation must take into account the imperatives and objectives freely chosen by the under- equipped countries.103.	The reform of the economic structures of under- equipped countries and the harmonization of their economic policies are necessary conditions for achieving their economic integration.104.	The most remarkable event of recent times is the international monetary crisis  whose effects continue to be felt in economic relations among States. You will agree with me that the international monetary crisis is but the reflection of a deficiency of the structures of the international monetary system; and  in the view of the Zaire delegation  this system must be revised so as to take into account economic realities which have been radically altered since the end of the last World War. One cannot  without contradicting history  rely upon the economic prosperity of a few States to build up a system of payments which would encompass all nations. The international monetary system must not any longer be directly tied to the monetary systems of a few States  no matter what their economic power. Therefore we are aware of the fact that the management of the international monetary system  a renovated system  must be entrusted to the will of the international community. For this the International Monetary Fund will have to be profoundly altered in its structure and its statutes  so that sooner or later the management of that body will be organized so as to enable it to play the role of a central bank on the national level.105.	The international division of labor as revised  the reformed international monetary system and the international economy will be able to make a new st-art on a solid  sound and just basis. As long as there is no reform of the structures of the whole international economic system  we are convinced  fluctuations will continue to affect inter-State relations  and the efforts of States and international organizations to remedy this state of affairs will always fall short of the mark.106.	No matter what influence the international situation may have on the results of the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago  Chile  especially on trade  the under-equipped countries may quite justly speak of their disappointment in view of the few concessions made b^ equipped countries in fields where they have a monopoly. Since the hopes of the under-equipped countries to improve their trade balance have again been dashed  we wonder to what extent we can still rely on the goodwill of the equipped countries to solve the problems arising from time to time in the international economy.107.	We must admit that one of the most important matters taken up in UNCTAD was the important problem of the stabilization of primary commodity prices. How is it possible to conceive that raw materials  upon which the economy of almost all  if not all  under-equipped countries depend  should be the object of speculation on the part of a few businessmen in some well-known markets? To say that the speculation affects only tiny or even non-existent amounts confirms the justifiable disappointment of the under-equipped countries. In other words  in the world everything happens as if some countries had only one right  that of producing  and others had the right to buy at the price which they themselves determine or  even worse  at a price determined by a few speculators. Worst of all is the fact that these raw materials bought at prices which are eternally fluctuating serve to manufacture finished goods which are then resold to countries producing raw materials  that is to say  the under-equipped countries  at excessively high prices.108. In view of this fact  the Republic of Zaire has solemnly expressed its determination not to be any longer a reservoir of raw materials which can be drawn on at will. Even in the field of international assistance  which in principle is supposed to make up the shortcomings of international trade  the hopes of the under-equipped countries have again been dashed. Indeed  to attain the objectives of the Second Development Decade  the United Nations had decided that this year at the latest the equipped countries would make available to the under-equipped countries 1 per cent of their gross national product  of which 0.7 per cent would be represented by public assistance. This decision has practically remained a dead letter  and to the very small extent that it has been put into effect it has been on conditions which are in any case unacceptable to Zaire.109. With regard to the conditions in which international assistance is granted to under-equipped countries  it has constantly been repeated from this rostrum that the equipped countries which do the lending must take into account the economic difficulties of the under-equipped countries in the matter of the reimbursement of the loans. The growing burden of foreign debt of the under-equipped countries and the constant desire of equipped countries to profit from their assistance face the former with a very difficult choice which certainly does not foster the development of the international economy.110. Thus  President Mobutu Sese Seko  speaking before the First Congress of the Popular Movement of the Revolution  offered the following thoughts to the world:""In our under-equipped countries  we welcome technical assistants who are paid totally or partially by the donor countries but whose salaries are either spent or saved in rich countries and even promote a black market in our currencies.""The granting of fellowships to our young people who take courses in industrialized countries is worth while to the extent that the student comes back with more solid knowledge. But the expenses connected with this form of assistance are incurred in the donor country and redound to its benefit. Moreover  most of the time our students come back to us having completely lost their sense of identity.""The word 'assistance' is also used when  in order to enable us to buy manufactured goods  we are granted purchasing credits. But who gains by that? Obviously the exporting firms and the banks which make possible the financing-but never the consumer country  because its foreign debt is only increased by this.""111.	Therefore  these examples compel the Republic of Zaire to draw some bitter conclusions  and this has led us to radicalize our economic revolution.112.	Of course  we know that  after all  this is a human problem. How can one expect qf a rich man that he will help you so that you may attain his status? That is an aberration.113.	We have said in Zaire that we shall be the architects of our own development. We shall reach our economic objectives in accordance with our own will and our own resources and relying solely upon our own efforts. Foreign assistance will be used as a stopgap only when absolutely necessary  but we shall do everything in our power to see to it that in this process of economic revolution we shall be able to do without this stopgap.114.	These are the political and economic realities of the world. In Zaire  under the dynamic leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko  we have decided to play our part  and we declare this solemnly in this hall  in this Organization  which is designed to ensure the well-being and happiness of mankind.115.	To you international economists who attach importance to the gross national product in drawing up the lists of developing countries  we say  in Zaire  with President Mobutu Sese Seko  that we attach more importance to per capita national happiness.116.	The seas and oceans constitute huge reserves of raw materials and of mineral  biological and energy sources. Their exploration is proceeding favorably and their exploitation will be under way quite soon.117.	In view of these new possibilities  a part of international opinion has some legitimate questions. Who will profit from these new resources? The answer is obvious. The same people: the rich  the strong  those who have great resources material  financial or human unless an urgent and universally accepted solution is found within the framework of a renovated law of the sea. We all know that the sudden discovery of a rich under-sea deposit of manganese  copper or oil would certainly have a strong influence on the prices of these ores derived from the land.118.	That is why  in New York as in Geneva  the delegation of Zaire is positively studying the question of finding a new law of the sea for the international community.119.	The sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction have quite correctly been declared to be the common heritage of mankind. This principle will ensure free access  rational and balanced exploitation  and the equitable distribution of the under-sea resources of the international zone.120.	""Produce at all costs"": that is the motto of the developed countries. And that is the source of pollution. Therefore we wonder whether it is necessary to have innumerable factories if their chimneys are going to pour our toxic products on us day after day. I have been told that in one of the largest cities in the world the mere fact of breathing is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. I have also been told that in the same large city the hearing of the inhabitants is progressively affected after 25 years of age and that mental troubles caused by environ-mental assault progressively destroy the individual by acting on his psyche and his organism.121.	It seems to me that these horrible facts should arouse the universal conscience to the urgency of finding a solution to the problems of the environment.122.	The under-equipped countries are lucky to be able in their progressive industrialization  to take this important element into account.123.	We know that in your super-industrialized societies  you have works of art  your monuments  your cathedrals  your castles.124.	In the Republic of Zaire we say that we have our monuments which are masterpieces of nature. These are our rivers  our mountains  our volcanoes  our lakes  our plains  our animals.125.	We say  with our President  that in view of the degree of pollution of industrial societies  we might one day become the last refuge of nature in its natural state.126.	We have spoken of the economic aspects of the contemporary world. And this is no accident. This is an attitude which reflects the major concerns of the Republic of Zaire  which are marked by a historical truth: there is no real political independence without economic independence.127.	We must now speak up about the political problems of our day  and the first is international peace and security. My delegation is happy to recognize the efforts made in the world in the field of international peace and security since the end of the last session of the General Assembly.128.	We followed with great interest and attention the journeys of the President of the United States to China  the Soviet Union and Poland.129.	We consider that these initiatives which promote the convening of a conference on European security should be encouraged by the United Nations.130.	We think that the signing of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin on 3 September 1971 is an important step in the process of detente in Europe.131.	Despite the optimism which seems to pervade inter-national relations within an atmosphere of a relative detente  we cannot shut our eyes to the ominous developments of the Middle East tragedy. We know  we must recognize  that this problem remains unchanged and is a matter of great concern.132.	The Republic of Zaire  which unfortunately from the very first hours of its independence knew the horrors of internecine warfare  can only deplore the loss of human life.133.	We sincerely pray that one day peace and harmony will prevail in that part of the world.134.	On 22 November 1967  after negotiations which lasted more than a whole night  a resolution was adopted by the Security Council. This resolution  242 (1967)  had the advantage not only of establishing a satisfactory balance  but also  and especially  of meeting with the agreement of all the parties concerned. Why do we then not recommend that it be fully and faithfully applied? In any case  that is the sincere wish of my country.135.	As in the case of the Middle East we deplore the loss of human life in the Indochinese peninsula. We hope that one day it will be possible to say that the man who advanced the idea of homo homini lupus did not translate or reflect the historical reality of mankind. And yet here again political will is necessary. The Paris Conference represents a hope. International public opinion is entitled to expect that the negotiators of the avenue Kleber will one day translate this hope into fact. International public opinion is also entitled to expect that all countries will bend every effort to help find a final solution to the problem of the peninsula.136.	To speak of an easing of tensions is also to speak of disarmament. General and complete disarmament to us is synonymous with the strengthening of peace and security in the world. Men have perfected their technology in the manufacture of weapons of war to such an extent that a world war today would be a catastrophe for mankind.137.	This bitter statement puts me in mind of the well-known sentence of President Kennedy expressing a harsh truth: ""Mankind will have to put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind.""138.	On the other hand  by disarming and by renouncing the manufacture of nuclear weapons new funds would be freed which might usefully be employed to allay the sufferings of mankind.139.	Another matter of concern  and certainly the most important  is that of decolonization. Colonialism is-and Portugal knows it-a denial of democratic principles and fundamental rights which must govern all men in all latitudes  in keeping with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and the just and honest expression of universal conscience as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted by the General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)].140.	But there are still people who are deaf because of selfish and sordid interests and who refuse to decolonize and therefore place themselves outside the pale of the international community and defy it. Even better  these deaf people are practicing subtle and systematic genocide against the peoples of African territories still under their domination.141.	That is why  since there are no other ways of obtaining the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) by Portugal  the natural course of events and of history have led the international community in general and the United Nations in particular to recognize the legitimacy of the struggle led by the liberation movements in Angola  Guinea (Bissau) and Mozambique.142.	The United Nations also has an effective role to play in ensuring the accession to independence of still colonized peoples. Posterity will judge the effectiveness of the acts of the international Organization in the field of decolonization.143.	The Republic of Zaire considers th.n the States Members of our Organization should refrain from any act which might be interpreted as assistance to Portugal in the pursuit of its anachronistic and shameless policy.144.	We must draw the attention of the partners of Portugal to the negative and prejudicial effect on the cause of African progress of economic and military co-operation with that country which obstinately continues to pursue a retrograde policy of colonial oppression.145.	In view of this alarming situation my country appeals to the universal conscience so that all free and justice-loving States will do everything in their power to compel the Lisbon leaders to comply with resolution 1514 (XV).146.	As far as we are concerned  and in view of the persistent refusal of Portugal to negotiate with the nationalists with which it is fighting  we could not possibly abandon our unconditional support for the freedom fighters. As the Assembly knows  it was on the initiative of Presidents Mobutu Sese Seko and Ngouabi that the reconciliation between the two liberation movements  of Angola was made possible in order to unite their forces in the face of the common enemy  colonialist Portugal.147.	Another problem of decolonization is that of the Zimbabwe people  victims of the oppression of a few white racist settlers.148.	Since 24 November 1971  international public opinion has been informed of the ""Anglo-Rhodesian Agreements"" or rather the ""proposals for a settlement"" of the Rhodesian question.149.	Today we know what unanimous answer the Zimbabwe people reserved for these proposals. We did not have to await the results of the investigation by Lord Pearce to know the opinion of Zimbabwe people concerning its future. This categorical ""No"" could have been foreseen. It has but one meaning-general disapproval of the illegal situation created in Zimbabwe  so-called Rhodesia  after 11 November 1965.150.	The aspiration to freedom and independence among all peoples is part of an irreversible movement of history which nothing can arrest. Through its wholesale rejection of the so-called proposals for settlement  the Zimbabwe people has shown its determination to fight for national independence. The Zimbabwe people itself clarified matters. We think now that the British Government has no alternative but to intervene more effectively with a view to restoring the usurped rights of the majority people of Zimbabwe.151.	I could not conclude this consideration of the problems of decolonization without mentioning the painful problem of apartheid. The only crime committed by the Africans herded into their wretched reservations and ghettos is that they have a black skin.152.	Universal civilization  I am sure you will agree  is something that all peoples have contributed to with their own cultural components. That is a historic truth which the Republic of Zaire has reflected in its policy of ""authenticity""  which President Mobutu Sese Seko has brilliantly defined as a categorical refusal to be a carbon copy of anyone.153.	The policy of apartheid is abominable because it dehumanizes individuals.154.	We reaffirm our conviction that all men an equal  that they enjoy the same rights to human dignity and respect without distinction as to color  race  religion or sex. We shall  therefore  never condone a human being or a group of human beings claiming to possess the privilege of governing other people merely because of their color.155.	That is why my country is extremely concerned for the fate of the Namibian people  which also is subjected to the abominable regime of apartheid. This is the occasion to stress that the United Nations still bears full responsibility for Namibia. I should like to remind the Assembly of the historic meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa last January  and the resolutions adopted by the Council on Namibia.156.	We know that since then our Secretary-General has traveled to South Africa and Namibia. We continue to place our trust in him to put an end as speedily as possible to this fiction that South Africa calls ""the task of Christian civilization"".157.	Mr. President  I should like to join my voice to those of previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations. It is an honor which all Member States of this Organization have done your country and you personally.158.	May I express the hope that under your guidance the international community will experience decisive improvements in the field of economic co-operation  in the field of the development of under-equipped countries and in the field of international policy  where we hope to see the advent of a new era of progress and mutual confidence in the interest of the whole of mankind.159.	I should like Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom I congratulate on his recent election as Secretary-Genera'!  to know that the support and understanding of the Republic of Zaire are extended to him in the performance of his lofty tasks.160.	And now I must conclude. Economic development is one thing; the vagaries of international political life are another. But one thing is of paramount importance: a sincere will to succeed. This is  we must reject all hypocrisy in international relations so as to enable mankind and this Organization to contemplate a brighter future. Is this a forlorn hope?"
"25",1460,"COG",27,1972,"Mr. President  in taking the floor for the- first time in this august Assembly  my delegation and I myself have the pleasant duty of conveying to you  first of all  our sincere congratulations on your election  to which my delegation contributed whole-heartedly. That election is a recognition of the qualities and ability that you have displayed in your country  in international life  and more particularly in your work at the United Nations. We are convinced that your objectivity  tact and sense of impartiality will imbue our work with the brilliance that it rightly deserves  and will achieve the results that the world expects.225.	Our Government is also pleased to see in your election a symbol of the evolution of our Organization  because you represent a country and a social system whose successes are day by day impressing an ever-growing portion of humanity and whose views are gaining increased acceptance in this Assembly.226.	May I also be permitted to pay a fitting tribute to Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  for the calm and effective manner in which he presided over the debates of the twenty-sixth session.227.	Lastly  we should like to congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our new Secretary-General  who  in the short time that he has had since his brilliant election  has spared no effort to apply the principles of the Charter.228.	This annual meeting of the representatives of many peoples of our world is always an occasion for meditation about the ties between nations. Even if the purposes that the United Nations had set for itself have not been attained  it is none the less proper constantly to ask ourselves if some positive results for the establishment of world peace have at least been obtained. Will the peoples whom we represent begin to see the dawn of the dream that the wisest of their ancestors cherished since the beginning of our existence  or  on the contrary  is their life still to be nothing but a ridiculous and intolerable nightmare.229.	At first sight  in looking back at the great events that have marked international life since the beginning of this year  some of us might be inclined to find some sources of satisfaction. Many clouds fraught with threats and conflicts have in fact been dispelled and dialogs that yesterday were impossible have been started. Man in 1972 has witnessed events which the most optimistic of prophets would have hesitated to forecast only a few years ago. And  even if these encounters and these conversations are still only harbingers and do not yet represent any real change  they at least reflect the sincere desire of mankind to go beyond immobility and misunderstanding  in order to progress towards the recognition of others and the right of others to live. We are perhaps only at the stage of a comedy of peace which is being played by the leaders of this world. But if they are doing this  it is because they feel compelled to do this by the pressure of their peoples. But  for that matter  if they are content only to play at the drama  they will create in their peoples a desire to come upon the stage and become no longer actors in an imaginary history  but actors  once and for all  in a real drama according to the dictates of their heart.230.	Among the rapprochements that have taken place  we wish to emphasize the satisfaction that we felt at the dialog begun between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. We hope that these conversations will succeed and that these two countries will be sitting in this Assembly  as we have always felt that they should.231.	But we are compelled to note that when we talk about peace in the world in which we live it is much more the peace of the advanced countries of the world. Europe and North America  swathed in the comforts offered them by the consumer society of our century  fear that this civilization of opulence may be attacked  this civilization that they have acquired at the cost of the blood and sweat of both the colonial and the neo-colonial countries  but they are disinterested in the fate of the damned of the third world. In order to maintain their way of life  they even go so far as to support war in a disguised form in those parts of the world where they are draining out the wealth.232.	Accordingly  my delegation is disappointed to note once again that the debate on Korea has been postponed until 1973. thus allowing imperialism to maintain a threatening climate in that region.233.	But when we refer to zones where peace is not assured  it is of our Africa that we think first. There we still have a situation in flagrant contradiction with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  one which constitutes an insolent and criminal negation of fundamental human rights  of man's dignity  his value  and in the last analysis of the equality and the rights of peoples. Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are still under Portuguese colonialist domination. And there is no need to be any great authority in political matters to know that that small country can persist stubbornly in its policy  despite the resolutions of the United Nations  only because it knows that it enjoys the financial  military  political and diplomatic complicity of certain Powers  particularly those which are members of NATO.234.	And it is also because those Powers treat with contempt and disdain the resolutions that we adopt here that the illegal regime of Ian Smith in Zimbabwe defies the civilized world at the expense of the black population of that part of Africa. And lastly it is for the same reason and strengthened by the same support that the minority and racist regime of Pretoria not only imposes its dictatorship and its inhuman regime of apartheid in South Africa and in Namibia  but even threatens the sovereignty and peace of States which in southern and central Africa have freed themselves from the colonialist yoke.235.	The relaxation of tension at the international level which emerged this year thus makes even more unacceptable the unjust and criminal aggression that a Power of the dimensions of the United States continually perpetrates day after day against the heroic Indochinese people of VietNam  Laos and Cambodia. While it proclaimed in San Francisco  on 26 June 1945  that it was ""determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind""  one of the signatories to this Charter  and not among the least of them  today is happily forcing upon a people which had already experienced a long and heroic armed struggle for national liberation the most painful and atrocious of wars that mankind has ever known. This is a war in which the United States is not satisfied merely with killing the combatants  but also kills women and children; war where the aggressor  flouting all laws  destroys hospitals and schools  compelling man to live underground; a war which destroys the dikes that the people of Vietnam had built in their struggle with nature. To sum up  this is a war where defoliants  herbicides and other biological and bacteriological weapons destroy even the environment where  once peace has been restored  the children of the heroes who today are giving their lives for their freedom will be expected to live.236.	In this connexion  the stubborn and guilty silence of the United States administration in the face of the seven-point peace proposal put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam and in the face of the proposal of 11 September to set up a tripartite Government of national concord provides just so many examples of the basically bellicose nature of imperialism.237.	None of us is deceived by the United States maneuvers. The reduction in its land troops and the so-called ""Vietnamization policy"" are actually accompanied by an increase of its air and naval forces and attacks.238.	It is that same war which the United States is pursuing throughout IndoChina by laying waste to Laos and supporting in Cambodia a clique thrown out by the people  so much so that in fact  the troops of the United Front of Kampuchea control 80 per cent of the territory. That is why my Government is pleased to have recognized  from the outset  the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  which is headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk  to whom  for that matter  justice has just been done at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Georgetown  when the status of full member was conferred upon him.239.	The People's Republic of the Congo believes that it is high time to restore the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union in the United Nations. Let us hope that the absurd situation which led to the failure to recognize the People's Republic of China for more than 20 years is not going to be repeated in defense of the clique which today usurps power in Phnom Penh.240.	But does all of this not show the impotence of the United Nations to enforce respect for the principles of its Charter an impotence which makes of most of our resolutions mere pieces of paper reflecting more our wishes than our real capacity to fight against the blind forces of war? Thus  despite Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which enjoined Israel to leave the occupied Egyptian territories  we see continued a situation which we believed had disappeared from the contemporary world  that is  a situation where one country invades another. The impotence of the United Nations in the face of this crime brings a bitter smile to the lips of our peoples  who have not forgotten  and can never forget  that at the time we were gaining our independence we saw the United Nations transport its troops to certain parts of Africa  not to establish the peace that was desired  but to engage in active intervention in the domestic affairs of our peoples. Yesterday it could intervene against the interests of Africa; today it is unable to restore the rights of an African country.241.	From all these events we are justified in concluding that if  on the one hand  an atmosphere of relaxation of tension has blossomed on our planet in this year 1972  it was outside of our Organization and  what is more  our Organization has not prevented its most influential Members from applying the law of violence at the expense of many peoples.242.	When  in addition  we note"" that the very people who promised peace to the world at San Francisco in 1945 are the same who now maintain situations of injustice and promote contempt for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law  one wonders whether certain States deserve the privileges they enjoy in the Security Council and whether the Charter of the United Nations should not be reviewed so that our Organization can undertake to promote the right of peoples to self- determination and peace through action commensurate with the vast sums which we give to it.243.	The People's Republic of the Congo  as well as Africa as a whole  is no longer under any illusion about the role of the United Nations as it is being shaped by the imperialist Powers. We have already learned the lesson that it is only by their own struggle that our peoples have won the right to enter this Assembly. The same is true for those who today claim their right to live. The impotence of our Organization compels them to have recourse to the on the path left open to them  that is to say  to take up arms. It is not our resolutions but their victories over Portuguese colonialism which will enable Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) to regain their legitimate rights.244.	In this connexion the report of the OAU Committee of Liberation on Guinea (Bissau) stripped the blinders from the eyes of those who persisted in considering that our freedom fighters were a handful of adventurers with no roots in the people. This time it has been decisively confirmed that the fighters of the PAIGC  effectively control two thirds of the territory. However  in Angola and Mozambique there are also vast areas that have been completely freed from colonial domination. These zones that are controlled politically and administratively by the liberation movements deserve aid from the United Nations for their reorganization and reconstruction.245.	As for South Africa  whose presence in this hall in. the form of a racist delegation is a direct affront to every African delegation  no honorable solution can be found other than through force used intelligently and for liberation against blind brutality.246.	In Zimbabwe  Great Britain was disconcerted by the popular reaction to the Anglo-Rhodesian agreement. Despite the measures of intimidation and reprisals of the Ian Smith minority clique  the people of Zimbabwe expressed themselves so decisively that the Pearce Commission  as we know  could not avoid noting the unpopularity of that agreement. Today  when the conclusions of this Commission are widely known  Great Britain would make a serious mistake if in examining the Pearce report  it frustrates the hope the African peoples still place in it. From the historical perspective  Great Britain has much more to gain by taking account of the rights of the African people than by considering the sordid interests of a handful of racists. My Government is convinced that the only solution to the problem of Zimbabwe is independence with the formation of a government by the African majority. The first stage would be the convening of a constitutional conference bringing together all sectors of the population  beginning with the liberation movements.247.	My delegation has read with interest and attention the report on Namibia prepared by the Secretary-General.  This is an opportunity for us to repeat the responsibility which devolves upon the United Nations in this part of Africa. As for our part  we cannot subscribe to any solution which does not provide for the unconditional withdrawal from Namibia of the South African police and administration. The powers of the United Nations in this Territory should be guaranteed by an international armed force which can enable the Namibian people to create  free from any foreign intervention  the conditions suitable for the exercise of its right to self-determination in unity and not in an ethnic and racial federalism which the South African racists would like to have and  as we know  they have already installed the black populations on the least desirable land.248.	While  on the one hand we take note of the appointment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia  we regret that it should have been necessary to bow to the caprice of the Pretoria racists  who took the liberty of rejecting the first nominations to that post. But regardless of any hidden motives on Pretoria's part  we are sure that the High Commissioner is aware that his task is to safeguard the interests of the people of Namibia and not those of the Pretoria racists. Let him be wary of their proposal for self-determination; let him remember that that self-determination must not impair either the territorial integrity of Namibia or the unity of its people. The High Commissioner has a responsibility not only as a civil servant vis-a-vis the Secretary-General  but also a still greater responsibility to the peoples of Africa and to history.249.	The People's Republic of the Congo endorses the following plan as it was enunciated by the South West Africa People's Organization: first  if on 15 September 1972 the Pretoria regime has not committed itself definitely to withdraw its administration from Namibia and has not made arrangements for that withdrawal; secondly  if South Africa does not demonstrate without ambiguity that it is prepared to recognize the right of the people of Namibia to independence as a single national entity; and thirdly  if South Africa does not commit itself clearly to recognize the political  civil  economic  social and cultural right of the Namibian people freely to determine their future without foreign intervention  then it will be useless to pursue any other form of contacts between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the racists of Pretoria.250.	If that were to be the case  no matter how unseemly it may be to have to say this  Africa  in the settlement of its problems  will have less and less confidence in the United Nations and much more faith in itself. In the last analysis  this is what it has already stated quite recently at the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Rabat  when  after the disappointing results of the meetings of the Security Council at Addis Ababa  it decided to increase its aid to the liberation movements. This is also what it expresses each day more and more clearly by settling itself the disputes which arise within its frontiers. In saying this  we are thinking of the reconciliation achieved between Guinea and Senegal  between Guinea and the Ivory Coast  the treaty signed at Rabat between Algeria and Morocco under the aegis of the recent summit  meeting of OAU  the reconciliation between Zaire and my country  the efforts which are now under way between President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Ngouabi of the People's Republic of the Congo  to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute between Gabon and Equatorial Guinea  and lastly those efforts which are being undertaken by President Siad Barre of Somalia to quench the fire that has just blazed up along the frontiers between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.251.	All these contributions to peace deserve our praise and should be emphasized as victories of the people against imperialism  which is  in our opinion  the primary root cause of the wars of our era.252.	Just so long as that scourge exists we strongly doubt the possibilities for disarmament. But even if the damned of the earth use weapons to liberate themselves  they are not responsible for armed conflicts. They take up arms because they are refused any other solution. They use weapons because their claims are met only with armed troops. We would prefer peace in which to liberate ourselves  because we know that in these liberation struggles it is we who pay the heaviest price in human lives  lives which we shall need for our national rebuilding. This I say to show you how much we are in favor of disarmament. If that were a reality  complete and effective  nothing could oppose the peaceful march of peoples towards the reconquest of their rights. But we do not subscribe to a partial formula of disarmament. Moreover  we refuse to have this problem of disarmament  even if it is only the question of nuclear weapons  dealt with only by the Powers that possess the most advanced weapons. The peace of the world will be the concern of all nations  large and small  or it will be the concern of none.253.	My delegation cannot remain silent in the face of the insidious maneuvers of certain great Powers which  while they promote racism in certain parts of the world for which they bear responsibility  today want an African State which wished to exercise its sovereignty to be tried by our Organization  we are told  for crimes against humanity. We consider that it is not our business to pass any value judgment on the decision taken by the Government of Uganda  to which reference was made here yesterday by Sir Alec Douglas-Home [2042nd meeting]. This is not the first time in history that a sovereign State  including the United Kingdom  has expelled foreigners from its national soil without any reckoning being demanded of it. The United Nations is not competent to deal with this problem  although it could ask for an explanation from the United Kingdom  which does not want to see returned to its shores British citizens who are not of Anglo-Saxon origin.254.	We shall therefore oppose and we call upon all delegations of Africa and all countries that love justice and peace to oppose what would be a mockery of justice.255.	But how can I conclude without saying a word about this problem which the Secretary-General has proposed for inclusion in our agenda [A/8791 and Add.l]  the definition of which is so delicate in nature that it threatens to stir up our jurists just as much as the concept of aggression has stirred them. Of course I am referring to the question of terrorism.256.	May I be permitted to state that my Government is surprised that a problem which if not as old as the world itself is at least much older than the United Nations should be brought to our attention only as the result of the attacks which have just cast a pall over the Olympic games at Munich  attacks which we deplore.257.	But it would be unfortunate if under the guise of fine sentiments we should seek actually to condemn the action of the Palestinians and the other freedom fighters.258.	What we are witnessing today is the protective reaction of the world of the well-to-do and high-principled nations  which have seen death strike by chance and hit some of their own people unjustly. However  that world never raised its voice against the terrorism that it spread beyond its frontiers and its seas. It is we  the Africans and Asians who have experienced European terror when  debarking on our shores  they hunted us in order to sell us  when they penned us up in order better to enslave and exploit us.259.	Colonel de Montagnac  one of the conquerors of Algeria  wrote: ""To dispel the thoughts which sometimes beset me  I have heads cut off  and not artichoke heads  but rather human heads."" That is terrorism.260.	Pierre Loti  the well-known writer  described the taking of Thouan-An in Annam in Le Figaro in September 1883 as follows:""Then the great slaughter began. We had volleys of shots fired and it was a pleasure to see the bursts of the shots which were so easily aimed  showered on them twice every minute  by command*. in a methodical and sure-fire manner ... We saw people who were absolutely crazy  who revealed a dizzy impulse to run ... They followed a zig-zag course throughout the length of this death run; then they squat down on their haunches in a comical fashion . .. and then we amused ourselves with counting the dead.""That is terrorism. We are not quoting these two examples in order to reopen a case which has. already been tried many times  but rather to recall that this terrorism  adapted to meet the requirements of space and time  still continues today in South Africa  in Zimbabwe and in the Portuguese colonies.261.	In addition to this terrorism we have that which day by day the United States bombers inflict on civilian populations  women  the sick in hospital and children in schools in Vietnam. The bombing of Guernica inspired Picasso to create one of the most famous canvases of this century  which is an outcry of horror against nazism. But Guernica is happening today  more than 400 times in a single day in Vietnam. Is there any greater terror? And why do people pretend to ignore that terror which has just been spread blindly along the frontiers of Lebanon by the armies and aircraft of Israeli Zionism?262.	It is said that the Palestinians failed to respect the Olympic truce  which has a tradition consecrated by more than a thousand years  but we were not aware either that during the period of the Games any calm appeared as a result of the initiative of the colonialists and imperialists in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau)  in South Africa  in Zimbabwe or in Indochina.263.	If in the People's Republic of the Congo we think that the best form of struggle is that which associates the masses with the action we still do not have that good conscience which authorizes certain people to dictate the form of struggle for those who are fighting for their rights and whom the oppressor forces to extremes out of which gestures of desperation are born. We cannot judge with the same severity the oppressor and the oppressed. Otherwise we should be taking the part of the former against the latter.264.	Moreover  in the official education it provides for its children the Christian and bourgeois West has found it proper to devote pages of tributes to the terrorists who liberated their countries by harassing the invaders. There was Fabius Cunctator against the Carthaginians; there was Spartacus against the masters of the slaves  Vercingetorix against the Romans  the Spanish patriots against the armies of Napoleon; there were the partisans throughout Europe  the ""soldiers of the night"" against nazism to whom Andre Malraux referred.265.	All police measures against these actions and against the hijacking of aircraft for political reasons will remain without effect. What we need is to uproot the evil completely: to uproot racism  colonialism and imperialism; to return their country to the Palestinians. We cannot separate their actions from the circumstances that have engendered them. They were engendered in conditions that we made favorable by ignoring their rights  by taking no interest in their fate  by throwing them into a ghetto beyond the bounds of humanity. If the Europeans of 1972 no longer blow up trains and bridges  it is because their countries are free. Palestinians in a Palestine regained will go to the Olympic Games  no longer to take hostages but to compete with other nations in the stadium games just as the Palestinians in a Palestine regained will no longer have any reason to hijack aircraft.266.	You of course understand that we have not made a profession of faith in terrorism  but we wanted to express our vehement opposition to any trend or to any draft resolution the purpose of which would be to absolve the consciences of those who wish to condemn terrorists but excuse those engenderers of terrorism  to whom I have referred in sufficient detail throughout my statement.267. As everyone knows  our world is marked by a fundamental imbalance in the process of the development of nations. Two quite separate blocs characterize in shocking terms the economic structures of the countries of the world. These are the zones of abundance on the one hand and the poverty zones on the other. This contradiction was created in the name of a so-called civilizing and humanitarian mission undertaken by the colonizing Powers.268.	But in reality these Powers have contributed and continue to contribute to the despoiling of the resources of the countries making up the poorer zones. Colonization has constituted and continues to constitute the most violent weapon the most virulent scourge obstructing the developing of a large part of the world.269.	The colonizing Powers bear the heavy responsibility for the backwardness in economic development which afflicts the majority of the countries of the third world today.270.	It is another scandal of our era that on one and the same planet individuals of the same species do not enjoy in the same manner the fruits of the progress of science and technology of the modern age. While some live in abundance and even in waste  others are condemned to attempt to survive in misery and almost total deprivation  in conditions in which life is only a pause between birth and death. Hence it is quite obvious that such a disequilibrium deepens the contradictions between the wealthy and the poor. Those who are hungry have a legitimate right to demand that the distribution of the fruits of science and technology should be done in an equitable  even-handed manner  as they are well aware that their servitude and then- exploitation financed this formidable flowering of science and technology which we are witnessing.271.	To soften the ultimate logical reactions of the poorer countries  at one time it was thought that the wealthier countries would become increasingly aware'-of the poverty of the countries of the third world. What is more  it was thought that this awareness would lead them to work out a vast program of co-operation in order to lessen the economic imbalance which divides them from the developing countries.272.	Thus  immediately after they had attained their independence  several countries of the third world entered into a considerable number of negotiations designed to conclude with the signature of agreements for bilateral co-operation; but this practice did not produce the results expected. In the light of this co-operation and assistance  which consisted of supplementary assistance with  in most cases  an element of domination  and also in the face of the increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries  it was thought that international co-operation might be an unselfish and decisive factor in the progressive elimination of the economic backwardness of the developing countries. This initiative took shape through the creation of a dynamic body reflecting the fundamental objectives defined in the Charter of the United Nations: I refer to UNCTAD. Since it was set up  it has held three sessions. True  some decisions were taken in favor of the countries of the third world  but after the third session the feeling of frustration  far from declining  had  on the contrary  increased among the countries of the third world. Repeatedly the developed countries were seen to adopt a selfish attitude  and in particular the developing countries deplore the fact that they were not associated with the important negotiations which culminated in an international monetary reform. Moreover  the economic dis-parities continue to grow between the wealthy countries and the countries of the third world. The output of the developing countries has not expanded  and the income from exports needed for the industrialization of those countries has constantly suffered from a deep decline in the terms of trade and obstacles to trade between countries with different levels of development.273. The indifference that the rich countries display towards the development of the developing countriesseriously endangers international peace and security. It weakens the fundamental objectives of the United Nations Charter  an Organization of which they are Members. It therefore weakens our Organization.274. The noble ideals defined in the Charter should not constitute mere words but should be dynamic and active statements. That is why my country thinks that in the International Development Strategy for the Second UnitedNations Development Decade  adopted unanimously by the General Assembly on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  the interests of the developing countries should inevitably be the subject of very special attention in any new world trade and monetary system. The wealthy countries should bow to this international imperative  without which any coexistence of the international community would be incompatible with the fundamental purposes of the Charter and thus would lead to a worsening of the international situation.275.	The recent firm positions taken by the developing countries at the third session of UNCTAD should have been sufficient evidence of the ripening of their awareness of their interests  which are attached by the developed countries. This energetic attitude of the developing countries must not leave the wealthy countries and international opinion unmoved if we want international peace and security to be preserved in the interests of all  and in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.276.	Every year bears a symbolic seal for our Organization. It is then that we are given an opportunity to reflect  to adopt resolutions and to begin on actions in accord with the theme that has been chosen. It is within this framework that the Secretary-General has told us that the year 1974 will be the Population Year.277.	The People's Republic of the Congo reserves the possibility of studying the subject in great depth and in due course to make known the results of those studies  based on its own real situation.278.	But as of this moment we consider that we are in a position to state that this theme should not be tackled with certain specific unduly rigid views in mind. Among these  we would emphasize the attitude which considers that the cure for world ills is to be found in limiting the earth's population. Certain countries may have reasons to feel that they are over-populated  That is not the case of Africa. Moreover  the concept of over-population is a relative one. It is determined on the basis of the country's development in all its aspects. A particular country of Europe or North America might have appeared to be over-populated in the eighteenth century with the population that it has in the twentieth century. Is not the real problem rather that of liberating the natural and human energies which each country possesses? These energies and wealth are as infinite as nature itself. By this I mean to say that the possibilities for life are limitless. There are still innumerable areas where man can conquer the wilderness and render it productive. The obstacles relate rather to relations between nations  and within nations to the relations between men  rather than to the number of human beings.279.	I hope that the World Population Year  1974  will not be a year of depopulation  for then it would have been directed against man  man whom our Charter considers as the supreme asset.280.	The Assembly has never been so sovereign and so representative as it has been since the historic year of 1971  which saw the long-expected arrival of China in our midst. Unfortunately despite this fact  its activities in the settlement of disputes which threaten or undermine a great part of our planet are still largely hamstrung  benefiting the diabolical machinations of colonialism and imperialism.281.	Our vigilance and our activities should be redoubled in the interest of the lasting preservation of peace and the independence of nations.282.	The United Nations  by virtue of the noble task which devolves upon the Organization within the scheme of the Second Development Decade  should act in such a way as progressively to eliminate the regrettable disequilibrium in the distribution of the wealth of the world. It is almost a certainty today that no war will ravage Europe or North America. But it is equally obvious that the imperialist world will not hesitate to provoke or support slaughter in those vast areas which are the storage-houses of raw materials  and I refer to Africa  Asia and Latin America.283.	Many good intentions are to be found in the professions of faith made by certain great Powers. The People's Republic of the Congo would hope  for its part  that behind these intentions there will be no hidden designs and that  adhering to the fundamental problems  we will avoid allowing ourselves to be seduced by the song of the siren chanting lofty sentiments which often conceal sordid interests.284.	We deliberately choose to close on this note."
"26",1507,"COL",27,1972,"The United Nations continues to be the great hope for mankind to organize relations among States in a system based on peace and the dignity of the human person. On this road towards full justice the world becomes each day more united in its historic destiny. For this reason my opening words must be a greeting to those who constantly serve this ideal and  first of all  to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and to the President of the General Assembly  who is presiding over our work with such impartiality and efficiency. This is the great forum of the nations  whose hallmark is freedom of expression and in which our problems can be discussed.40.	The year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has confirmed the trend that we noted towards an almost total liquidation of the so-called cold war. This is a circumstance which is welcomed by all nations despite the difficulties still encountered in the work for peace. But it is a fact that hatreds are disappearing as are also the territorial scars of the frontiers whose recognition by the German nation was  until a short time ago  in doubt.41.	Today there is the possibility of a policy of under-standing between Eastern and Western Europe  and the day is not far distant when the once separated blocs will begin talks on a European security agreement. This is a new example of the efficacy of regional security arrangements  which Latin America advocated at the San Francisco Conference as being the true interpretation of the precepts of the Charter dealing with regional arrangements  based on the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. At"" that time this Latin American doctrine appeared to be a heresy from the universality of the principles of the nascent Organization  but time has shown that in the solutions of the problems of peace regionalism is the best way to achieve international co-operation.42.	Furthermore  with the entry of the People's Republic of China the balance between the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  has been replaced by a triangular concept of world decisions. Whatever our position may be with regard to the entry of that great Asian country to the world Organization  the fact is that the road has been opened to multi-polarity in international policy  which is further strengthened by the fact that the number of independent States which have shaken off the tutelage of colonialism and achieved the category of Members of the United Nations has increased steadily.43.	In this last third of the twentieth century we are nearing a truly world-wide political order which has far outstripped the concept of exclusively European international policies. Never before  perhaps  has the United Nations been better able to aspire to universality and to being an Organization which represents all continents.44.	Despite the good omens that encourage understanding among nations there has been unleashed on the world a wave of terrorism which manifests itself in different ways and which in some cases assumes the proportions of virtual political aggression. This violence does not stop at the borders of the countries in conflict  but takes place anywhere in the world  which is tantamount to a continuation of belligerency on neutral soil and makes victims among the peoples of countries completely outside the battle. This singular trend of our day seeks the methods of terrorism to introduce this new form of war among nations. This was the case in the events that recently took place during the Olympic Games in Munich  whose tragic results shook all mankind.45.	Colombia condemns violence in any form whether it be personal attack  skyjacking  the taking of hostages  or collective massacres for all of them constitute a return by man to those eras which we had thought belonged to the past: the use of primitive means of violence to achieve political ends.46.	The Charter lays down principles governing normal relations among Member States and we do not believe that they can be applied differently when law  reason and right must prevail over instincts of violence.47.	We could never condone any type of attack or violence as licit forms of the struggle to solve international differences. Our civilization  already sorely beset by so many elements of violence  by individual crimes  by drug abuses  and even by the befouling of the air we breathe  will be even more seriously threatened and I would say doomed if those who practice sports  cultivate the arts and letters or proclaim peace are included among the belligerents in a conflict that is not of their making.48.	But all violence has a cause  and the United Nations cannot overlook the fact that one of the aspects of the conflict in the Middle East-the destiny of the Palestinian people-is still awaiting solution. The problems involved in that long war are many  and a careful study must be made of all of them  as well as of the possibilities for peace which Colombia advocates and hopes will be based on justice and equity for the countries concerned  as stated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which calls for the integrity of States within secure and recognized frontiers.49.	Terrorism has also assumed the equally dangerous guise of skyjacking  whose stigma as a specific crime will remain a simple academic matter until a clear procedure for extradition which we still await is evolved. While there exist countries that serve as privileged sanctuaries to the kidnappers  this other type of useless violence will persist.50.	Solidarity among all nations must be tightened in order to eradicate the use of terrorism as a political weapon  as well as other forms of violence. But this presupposes the widest possible exercise of the self-determination of peoples as the guiding and basic tenet in the life of nations. The very Charter of our Organization sets forth this principle.51.	Colombia has defended ideology and even economic plurality as facets of a policy of tolerance and respect for the self-determination of peoples regarding the choice of their own systems of government  and we feel that an effort that has been neglected for over 10 years that of determining of rights and duties of States should be resumed in order to draft a treaty to complement our Charter  which has left many blanks in the clear-cut definition of the true rights and duties of all States.52.	Colombia is firmly convinced that self-determination of peoples is the key to peace  and its denial the beginning of war. Intervention is another ancient aspect of international life that has become anachronistic  now that powerful nations which fought in the last World War and which today represent different ideologies are tied by links of friendship and the Organization has approved so many declarations on peace and the rights of States by universal consensus.53.	More than 60 nations that were mere colonies during the last World War have since become emancipated  and this process is irreversible and cannot be stemmed or interfered with by interventions that create fictitious situations. So the war in VietNam cannot be left as a war  with neither end nor victory for either of the belligerents until the right of self-determination of that people is fully recognized.54.	New generations know well that war pays no dividend and that in a nuclear age it is as dangerous as to play with fire in an ammunition dump. Strictly local wars are a thing of the past  and whenever they may occur there is the inevitable fear of their spreading and of the indefinite continuation of the conflict where both troops and civilian populations suffer equally.55.	War today is more cruel and destructive than before because of the sophistication of the weapons and the use of chemical and technological means for the extermination of the adversary. Today the entire nation is the battle field the nation with its open cities  its industrial complexes  its irrigation networks and its crops. ""Total war""  which in 1914 seemed an apocalyptic nightmare  has today become an everyday reality  a more harsh and cruel reality for those masses who are not to blame for living so close to the inferno. Thus we wonder whether the lessons of Korea today on the way to unification might not serve as a blueprint for the two parts of Viet-Nam which  after more than 10 years of destruction and scorched earth  lies desolate and wasted as the result of a war which General de Gaulle foresaw would leave only the dead  without victors or vanquished.56.	The world in which we live is in essence a plural society in which no other stand is valid but that of the full recognition of the tangible and visible reality of the existence of a multiplicity of political and social systems.Colombia has understood this fact and entertains relations with Governments of the most diverse ideologies and social disciplines  with the single and special understanding that none will interfere in our domestic affairs  as we would not interfere in those of others. For many years the Latin American regional system has been based upon precisely this recognition  as we stated during the visit to Bogota of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile  my eminent friend Mr. Clodomiro Almeyda  when we proclaimed the need to recognize ideological diversity.57.	The political regime of no country can be an export-able commodity. If we admit this irrefutable fact of our day  we will have made significant progress towards the building of a new international order characterized by mutual tolerance  respect for human rights and the general exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples. We must transfer to the international arena the same evolution that has taken place within the democratic and representative state  where parties coexist as organized elements for political and public action within the framework of the law.58.	That same pluralism is carried over into the field of economics. The variety of systems in the world also applies to economic and social matters; and international organizations must start with the premise that their primary task is to build bridges between different types of society. World exchange is necessary among all countries for  when all is said and done  we live in a society in which progress must be intensively speeded up in order to cope with ""revolution of rising expectations"" which is occurring everywhere.59.	Colombia has been following this practice and applying it constantly to our relations with other continents and in our own Western hemisphere  where  with the countries of the Andean region  we are making headway in our experiment to integrate our economies and harmonize our economic practices in order to make joint plans to do away with tariffs simultaneously and to set our common industrialization targets.60.	Generally speaking  international treaties and agreements must be able to withstand the acid test of changes of government  for they cannot be considered as applying to specific persons or parties  ceasing to exist when these disappear  as were the family agreements of the monarchic period of Hie eighteenth century.61.	An era of negotiations has  in fact  dawned in relations between the great Powers  quite in keeping with the system which we have termed the triangular system of world decisions. Those negotiations have borne visible fruits in the relations among those great Powers and obviously they have a beneficial effect on peace.62.	The triangular system is extremely restricted  extending to a very few nations  and overlooks the rest  the medium-sized and smaller countries. Special envoys are reminiscent of the diplomacy of the last century  when there were no world or regional organizations of many  nations linked by legal statutes establishing methods and ways of approaching the international problems and the means of solving the differences among States. Chapters VI and VII of the San Francisco Charter  which deal with the peaceful settlement of disputes and actions to be taken in case of threats or breaches of the peace or acts of aggression  seem to have been shelved. Excessive pragmatism on the part of the great Powers in the handling of world affairs has produced the strange phenomenon of the eclipse of the Security Council as the supreme body of the United Nations and the guide of the world political system as originally intended at the San Francisco Conference.63.	The immediate prospects for the United Nations are not encouraging. Progress towards peace is not paralleled by the same progress in international institutions. The San Francisco Charter is tending to be replaced by a system of secret negotiations among the powerful nations  and a new Charter of an exclusively political nature is being formed through tacit agreements among the great Powers  relegating the earlier institutions set up by the Charter to a secondary place. And thus in a few years we might well be confronted by two statutes  the nominal San Francisco Charter  and the more real and effective Charter elaborated by the great Powers.64.	This is a disturbing thing for the medium-sized and smaller nations  as has been recognized by our Secretary- General when  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  he notes that the United Nations has ""proved to be of limited value as an instrument of collective security"" [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 1J. Without over-looking the special responsibilities resting on the great Powers  the Secretary-General quite rightly goes on to state:""The world order that we are striving to build in the United Nations must meet the requirements of such a society"" a world society  that is ""and any other system  however effective in the past  obviously cannot be acceptable  in the long run  to the peoples of the world. The interests  the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot  at this point in history  be ignored in any durable system of world order."" [Ibid.  p. 2.]65.	The United Nations is limited by the circumstances that I have mentioned and  particularly  by the exclusive interplay of the interests of the great Powers themselves. Surely  we do not lack principles nor do we want for basic norms for peace but we are simply faced by the desire to consider them as nothing but a series of academic rules.66.	We do not for a moment imagine that we can alter that triangular system which rules world affairs at the moment. But we do believe that we should at least try to revise some of the basic aspects of the Charter of the United Nations. Colombia pledged its unreserved support to the United Nations from the very first years of the Organization's creation and  despite the limitations we have mentioned  we are still of the opinion that in the San Francisco Charter lie the keys to peace and to understanding among peoples.67.	The problem does not lie in new and solemn declarations of principle  but rather in a readjustment of out-mode procedures and models of conduct. No social organism can permit itself the luxury of immutability or of staying on the sidelines while great changes in the structure of countries and in the physiognomy of continents take place and when basic modifications in the technological capacities of mankind occur.68.	One indispensable condition for the correct functioning of United Nations institutions is that the idea of disarmament should be made a reality. While countries of all the continents spend the astronomical figure of $200 000 million a year on armaments  as U Thant  then Secretary-General of the United Nations  pointed out not many months ago  no thought can truly be given to the full implementation of the legal processes established in San Francisco for the solution of international disputes that lead to so-called local wars.69.	The excess of armaments in the world is one of the main obstacles to  the true fulfillment by the United Nations of its political and universal mission and it is one of the reasons for the survival of poverty and misery in many parts of the world. With an annual investment of $200 000 million  a considerable restriction is placed on the amounts that could be assigned for peace and the progress of the hungry  the illiterate and the disease-ridden peoples.70.	In the Organization of American States  Colombia has raised the question of the need  even on the smaller scale of Latin American armaments as compared with those of the great Powers  of laying down proportionate yardsticks to avoid increasing unnecessary military expenditures.71.	Disarmament is the corner-stone of the edifice of the United Nations. Any revision of the Charter requires and presupposes this condition which is as imperative for the great Powers as it is for the medium-sized and small States.72.	Apart from the above  the basic Colombian idea can be summarized as the desire to eliminate outdated provisions of the Charter such as the mention of ""enemy States"" in Article 53  which resorts to a language that dates back to the Second World War of more than 30 years ago.73.	We also believe that the powers of the Secretary- General  according to Article 99  should be strengthened. In this way  he would be able not only to ""bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security""  but also to ask for the convening of a meeting of the Security Council whenever he deemed it appropriate. Because of his special experience and responsibility  the Secretary-General should be endowed with the power permitting him to call for a meeting of the highest body of the United Nations on questions of security and the maintenance of peace. We also seek greater decision-making powers for the General Assembly in the designation of the Secretary-General  allowing it to make a selection from a three-name slate submitted by the Security Council.74.	On more important matters  Colombia has suggested: The widening of the universality of the United Nations by making it a right for all States to become Members  rather than a favor  as it is at present; the consideration of a new category of ""Associated States"" in order to settle the problem of the so-called ""mini-States""  thus making it easier for such States to enjoy economic and social co-operation and even co-operation in the political field and in that of security while not imposing on them the burdens of membership  which might be too onerous for them; the revision of the rules of the Security Council so that the unanimity of all five permanent members is not necessary in the case of simple elections to fact-finding committees or bodies dealing with humanitarian problems; the establishment of a peace force that will not be a fighting army  but a body intended to give military assistance in order to prevent certain areas from being totally unprotected or to guarantee peace formulas between former combatants; the updating of the functions of the Trusteeship Council in view of the fact that now only two territories of only relative importance fall under its jurisdiction and that even these territories are due to achieve autonomy in the very near future  when the Council will have no further duties and could be entrusted with trusteeship over human rights; the consideration of a closer relationship between the International Court of Justice and the tasks of peace as well as the creation of specialized branches for questions of a regional nature.75.	A special matter which should be discussed in the Assembly  in an endeavor to equip the United Nations to meet the needs of the times  is that of co-ordination between the many and varied existing economic organs. The proliferation of international organs is far too well known to require further comment  but the multiplicity of economic organs both inside and outside the United Nations does call for comment. The delegation of Brazil has proposed that the Economic and Social Council  expanded and reorganized  should become the equivalent of the Security Council on economic questions. In principle  my delegation and Government support that idea since it offers us an opportunity to ponder co-ordination among boards  conferences  commissions  bodies  all of which  in one way or another  deal with the same matters and come to different conclusions.76.	The United Nations was created when less than half the countries that today compose the third world were in existence when there was no hint of the claims submitted by the developing countries later at the three sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  held at Geneva  New Delhi and Santiago in 1964  1968 and 1972 respectively. The changes that have since occurred have completely transformed the nature of the discussions on international trade and economy.77.	Therefore  it should be only natural for the Economic and Social Council to serve as a body to co-ordinate and make decisions on matters within its competence without prejudice to UNCTAD continuing to be the forum for discussions between the industrialized nations and the third world.78.	One of the lessons that can be learned from the third session of UNCTAD is that the items to be discussed and dealt with among 140 countries of the most diverse economic capacities and geographical size should be more specialized.79.	The 22 items included in the agenda for the third session in Santiago were in point of fact an agenda not only for one  but for two  or even three  conferences of that type. The items were so extensive and difficult-items such as the trade and economic aspects of disarmament; the repercussions of environmental matters on trade; the present international monetary situation; the encouragement of exports; non-tariff barriers-and even one item that belongs more properly on the agenda of the Security Council: the closure of the Suez Canal.80.	We fear that these international conferences may easily lead to world-wide pandemonium  or to compromise resolutions that treat conflicting positions equally and refer them to study groups.81.	Apart from this  the questions raised at the third session of UNCTAD were all so closely linked to the international monetary situation  that  without a solution to the latter great problem  it is almost impossible to speak of doing away with barriers and obstacles to increased trade. An international trade policy is basically a policy of prices and of remuneration for labor in all 140 countries that were represented at Santiago. That fair-price policy for labor in the developing countries must take into account the monetary fluctuations of the great Powers and the lowering of the purchasing power which these bring about.82.	The disparities between the price system for industrial goods and the poor payment for raw materials are still all too obvious  and therein lies the major problem confronting the economy of the world.83.	Without dwelling on individual decisions of the third session of UNCTAD on the various items on its agenda  what was most notable there was the will of the countries of the third world to participate in bodies whose decisions affect their economies-that is  ultimately  the very fate of their peoples.84.	The bad precedent of a few and powerful countries possessing the power of decision on international monetary questions that affect all countries must be considered outmoded and should not be repeated.85.	International democracy cannot be a mere skeleton- lifeless and still nor should it be only a literary subject worthy of mention at the inauguration of conferences and in welcoming speeches.86.	The developing countries are beginning to take a decisive part in the international discussions on the law of the sea  whose evolution had  until a few decades ago  been subject to the control of the more powerful and wealthy nations.87.	Narrow territorial waters and freedom of navigation had been the ideal set-up for the great maritime Powers in order to ensure them unhampered entry into all seas and the exploitation of the oceanic wealth of all continents. That situation  so typical of the colonial enterprises of the nineteenth century had  as one of its mainstays  the three-mile limit that some countries proclaimed as a principle of international law. But colonialism is no longer a reality of our day.88.	As of 1945  and more noticeably since 1958  after the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the developing countries conceived new formulas that constitute a trend towards reviving the rights of the coastal States8and their sovereignty over the wealth of the seas adjacent to their shores. This was due to very special situations which must be conceded by the great Powers  and among these was the need to protect the plankton that serves as feed for a great number of sedentary or benthonic species against the reckless exploitation and exhaustion of these resources.89.	Following this line of thought  Colombia  together with 15 other countries of the Caribbean  formulated the doctrine of the patrimonial sea in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721  annex I  sect. 2]  approved at the meeting of the Ministers of the Specialized Conference of Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea in June of this year. That doctrine is the most constructive and carefully weighed contribution made to date to find regional solutions on the basis of the existence of an economic zone and of the sovereignty of the coastal State over the exploitation of the resources of the sea adjacent to its shores.90.	Our view is that the formula that is most closely akin to the legal realities of all continents is the one that recognizes an initial security zone  or territorial sea  of 12 nautical miles and an adjacent zone of primarily economic significance of variable widths up to 200 miles  depending on the width of the maritime areas and the location of archipelagoes in narrow seas like the Caribbean  where 200 miles cannot be drawn in all directions without infringing the sovereign rights of other States. The issue here is that those zones should allow freedom of navigation the jus communicationis and not become closed seas  and that at the same time  a unilateral proclamation should not infringe the sovereign rights of States with adjacent or facing maritime zones. We believe that those zones should be defined in international law  for we want to pass from the stage of purely unilateral declarations of claims by States to the stage of regional agreements governed by international law.91.	Colombia has been willing to have talks with other countries of our hemisphere in order to co-ordinate the different interpretations of the 200 miles in a regional agreement. This would be at a conference of the Latin American States that could at the same time serve as a preparatory conference for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to be held in 1973. Our attitude is one of international co-operation  but we realize that a new phase of this field of law has been reached by the emergence of clear economic needs.92.	The economic zones of the adjacent seas have even become a symbol of Latin American nationalism.93.	The number of items that will appear on the agenda of the forthcoming Conference are increasing considerably. Perhaps the authors of General Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV)  calling for the Conference in 1973  did not quite appreciate the universal scope and the great variety of problems that would arise because of the political and economic realities  scientific progress and the rapid technological developments of the last 10 years. Apart from the purely juridical and political factors that tend to modify the 1958 concepts on the territorial sea  the continental shelf  the high seas and fishing rights  there are now the problems of pollution of the marine environment and international co-operation in oceanic research. If we add to these the complex questions of the sea-bed  we find that there will be too many subjects for a single conference of limited duration to deal with.94.	Colombia wishes a program of work for that forthcoming Conference to be prepared here and now. It should not be impossible to envisage subdividing purely scientific questions  such as marine pollution and international co-operation in research  as well as certain aspects of the sea-bed  to form a special category of problems to be dealt with at special meetings within a co-ordinated work-plan  for the Conference must not become fragmented through a proliferation of items.95.	On the other hand  the other legal and political questions would be dealt with as a whole in a program of work that will avoid confusion in the debates on matters of a complex nature for which delegations will have to prepare themselves  first of all  to decide upon a policy for the sea and then  and only then  to take up the discussion of carefully prepared texts of articles or paragraphs of resolutions or conventions. In the discussion of the problems of the sea  priorities must be established.96.	In one word  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will have to set down criteria of its own on three main aspects: the expanded economic zones  the sea-bed and ocean floor  and the contamination and the ecology of the seas together with related scientific research. But at its present session  the General Assembly could make some progress with the organization of work.97.	My country has a consistent and lengthy tradition of compliance with international law in dealing with all foreign affairs problems. I do not believe I would be overstating the case if I say that our international conduct has always been clearly in keeping with the precise terms of law and of treaties. We do not believe that might makes right  or that violence and intimidation can be instruments of international policies. Our frontiers are clearly marked and we aspire to the territory of no other country.98.	Because of this constant principle of my country  we seek a more just world community governed by the norms and principles of. international law. We wish to see co-operation among States developing in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations not that we need principles and rules  but because we must have the will of all States to put them into effect. The international justice we advocate is not simply theoretical but is eminently practical  and is designed to find the causes of existing conflicts and to promote equitable treatment for the developing nations.99.	The myth of peace must  in this last quarter of the twentieth century  become the effective reality of peace. Despite its obvious shortcomings  the United Nations is still a good means of seeking that goal that is so ardently desired by my country and the immense majority of men and women of all other countries of the world. The sufferings of the war-torn peoples are the best justification for our appeal for peace in justice and law."
"27",1632,"CRI",27,1972,"Mr. President  I am very happy to add my congratulations to those you have already received from so many on your unanimous election as President of this session of the Assembly. It is a just recognition of your personal merits and a well-deserved tribute to your country  Poland  for whose prosperity I express my best wishes.133.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of our Organization during the past year [A/8701 andAdd.l] has been given the careful consideration which such a well-prepared document deserves. We are grateful to Mr. Waldheim for the information and the guidance his report has given us. It shall be our guide as we strive to be productive in the service of mankind  and it has aroused in my delegation greater confidence in what we can accomplish here.134.	We continue to believe that the United Nations is our best option to resolve the political conflicts which at present keep many nations apart or only serve to foster tension among them. We also continue to believe that it is here in this Organization that States have their best opportunity jointly to forge just  viable and effective solutions to reconcile their economic interests which have thus far seemed to be incompatible. We believe that in the United Nations peoples have their best opportunity to leave behind past errors and to build a future in which various cultures  diverse ideologies and different economic systems will compete nobly  in broad areas of agreement  so as to obtain for their citizens freedom  prosperity and the advancement of the human spirit.135.	The United Nations  born of the tragedy of global warfare and of the dismaying poverty and ignorance in which most of our fellow human beings live  cannot and must not fail.136.	Human institutions must periodically revise their structures and activities. New and unforeseeable needs require more suitable procedures  more flexible methods and more functional structures. The United Nations is no exception to this sociological rule. We do not cling to standards of action or structures which  in the face of new requirements  reduce the likelihood of attaining the purposes of those who forged the Charter at San Francisco. Experience is our teacher  and we must benefit from its lessons.137.	Costa Rica has welcomed  and plans to study  the proposals made by the illustrious Government of Colombia regarding certain amendments to the United Nations Charter [see A/8746]. We shall participate in the discussion of this item [item 89] in the certainty that the statements of other delegations will shed new light on how best still further to improve upon the proposals of Colombia  and we shall vote in favor of them when the time comes to adopt a decision.138.	However  we believe that together with reforms to improve the performance of our Organization it is necessary for all of us to acquire the conviction that the United Nations will be what the Member States wish it to be. The whole will be no better than the sum of its parts. The degree of sincerity with which each State Member of this Organization adheres to and achieves its objectives  the degree of sincerity with which each State supports its purposes and action  will be a measure of the degree to which the United Nations will respond to the hopes of the peoples of the world.139.	We welcome the relaxation of tension which has taken place between the great Powers  which has been made manifest in the statements of the Secretary of State of the United States of America [2038th meeting] and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics [2040th meeting] in this general debate. This move by certain great nations  which had maintained until quite recently dangerously hostile relations  to seek no longer armed confrontation but dialog  no longer diatribe but understanding and negotiation  nourishes the hope that peaceful coexistence and  even more  constructive relations among nations of various political creeds  can some day become a magnificent reality.140.	In our Organization we must give these budding signs  like weak plants  all our solicitous  patient and generous support  being aware that there is no human problem that man cannot solve if it is approached with a desire for justice and truth.141.	Of course  it is necessary that this collective action be supported by the individual conduct of each nation consistent with the expressions of peace and international co-operation which may be heard here.142.	The era of confrontation  born of the hatred and suspicion of the cold war  must for all time yield to an era of negotiation.143.	The extremist thesis that the democratic and Communist nations cannot coexist in the same world and that sooner or later one form of society will completely dominate the other must be rejected in theory and in practice as the product of sick fanaticism.144.	Regrettably  the residue of this fanaticism still permeates the propaganda which poisons the minds of peoples who live under both political systems. While the statesmen of the great Powers meet and strive to build a world in which they can live together in peace  their propaganda and security agencies continue to function according to the obsolete dogmas of the cold war. They seem to be determined to carry on the absurd task of maintaining the small nations as belligerents in a cold war which the leaders of the great Powers have already decided to replace by peaceful coexistence.145.	Costa Rica believes that the desire for peace  which has inspired the steps taken by the statesmen of the most powerful nations in the world in the last few years and has led to an atmosphere of coexistence  which we here applaud  must be supported and practiced by all nations  large and small. It is precisely for this reason that the Government of which I am a part decided to break the isolation in which it has lived with regard to the socialist nations and has established beneficial diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union  Czechoslovakia  Bulgaria  Poland  Hungary  Romania and Yugoslavia.146.	This position has exposed us to enraged propaganda attacks on the part of those who wish to maintain the climate of the cold war  and those attacks have been welcomed by the fanatics in our own country and have created suspicion among some Governments in our area which are still living under that influence. Nevertheless  our Government is prepared to continue to deal with those who prefer to sacrifice mankind to a nuclear holocaust rather than tolerate the existence of political doctrines contrary to their own.147.	The acceptance of the existence of various ideologies in the political field and the conviction that it is undesirable  and indeed impossible  for a man or a nation to determine what is best for all of mankind constitute the very basis of the democratic system  in which we hope to continue to live in Costa Rica. We are therefore prepared to maintain and broaden our relations with nations which have adopted systems different from ours  as long as they respect our sovereignty. We feel sure that this position  which has unleashed a storm against our Government  deserves the support and understanding of the vast majority of the States Members of this Organization.148.	The United Nations is committed  because of its origin  to carry forward to the end in the fight against fear. That is why the item on disarmament must be a key question at every session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General has sadly warned us that there has been no halt or perceptible slowing down in the arms race [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 3]. The information that he has furnished us is alarming. It states that in the decade of the 1960s the countries of the world allocated $1 870 000 million to acquire weapons of war and that in the last years the total military expenditures for that purpose have increased by approximately $200 000 million a year. Costa Rica  which has set an example and shown that it is possible for a nation to live without an army  sadly takes note of these facts. We regret even more that nations with grave problems of under-development have become swept up in this dizzying arms race.149.	However  there are signs of hope  at least in the legal field  in the commitments that nations have entered into. The Antarctic Treaty; the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  Outer Space and under Water; the Tlatelolco Treaty; the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the treaties which forbid the emplacement of nuclear weapons in outer space  the sea-bed and the ocean floor; and the recent convention on the prohibition of the use of biological weapons; as well as the agreement reached at the summit meeting held in Moscow in May of this year by the leaders of the two great Powers of the world on the limitation of strategic weapons-all of this has raised the hopes of peoples that the night of terror will be left behind  and we now dimly see at least the dawn of a day without terror.150.	The General Assembly must continue to go forward. The hopes of peoples during this session would be increased if States which have not yet done so would announce that they have signed any of those treaties  in which they have been invited to participate. We shall welcome any action intended to establish some organ charged with preparing  prudently but with firm resolution  the convening of a world disarmament conference which would be charged with attaining one of the noblest goals which the peoples set for themselves when they constituted the United Nations  namely  to end the scourge of war.151.	In the past years there has been an epidemic of criminal attacks and threats against personal security. We have had to endure a wave of savage terrorism which  in the words of Secretary of State Rodgers  ""tragically touched the lives of people everywhere  without warning  without discrimination  without regard for the sanctity of human Me"" [2038th meeting  para. 76].152.	In a praiseworthy move to draw the attention of the United Nations to the principal problems of mankind  the Secretary-General made a solemn appeal to this Assembly to seek the appropriate means to fight terrorism and other forms of violence which jeopardize and destroy innocent human lives.153.	The Foreign Minister of Brazil  Ambassador Mario Gibson Barboza  deplored in this Assembly the fact that no support had been given to the wording of the item as requested by Secretary-General Waldheim in the clear and decisive manner in which it was recommended by the General Committee [ibid.  para. 6]. Like my colleague  I regret that amendments were introduced to that wording which seem to imply that in certain cases terrorism could be considered a legitimate political instrument. We totally reject these attempts to justify what cannot be justified. We can never accept the view that in order to reach certain political or social aims it is permissible to endanger the lives of innocent human beings who are totally alien to the conflict  or to disrupt international communications  thereby reducing the opportunities for people to come together.154.	On other occasions in this and other forums Costa Rica has proposed the adoption of severe measures to put an end to terrorism. We have asked that such measures be applied not only to the persons who carry out terrorism and to the organizations responsible  but also to the Governments which protect them. If no nations were accomplices  terrorism would not last long. The suspension of air service to and from the countries which give refuge to the pirates and terrorists in general would doubtless constitute one of the most effective means in the fight against such crimes against mankind.155.	My delegation will support any draft resolution or convention intended to combat in the most effective way possible this criminal activity. We consider that we cannot leave this session of the Assembly without having formulated adequate instruments to contain international terrorism. We therefore would venture to appeal to the delegations that were determined to postpone the discussion of so fundamental an item in the Sixth Committee to set aside their obstructionist attitude and  '-without any political preferences or ideological partisanship  to realize that it is urgent and indispensable to unite firmly and decisively to confront this indiscriminate and odious violence  which violates one of the basic human rights proclaimed by our Organization.156.	The Middle East continues to be the burning issue in which world peace is at stake. There is at issue both peace and security as well as the possibilities for the economic and social development of the people of the area who deserve our fullest sympathy.157.	It is with dismay that we have seen how in the past this Organization has adopted certain resolutions which  instead of promoting peace  have contributed to the creation of obstacles to a direct understanding between the parties to the dispute. The debates have been neither calm nor objective. The voting has been in blocs  in most cases without taking into account the merits of the proposals under study.158.	Costa Rica is intensely concerned to contribute  with other nations  to bring about the day when peace will reign in the Middle East. We have proposed and will continue to ; propose and support dispassionate draft resolutions which seek a meeting of the minds between the parties. We shall insist on the need to prepare the way for direct negotiations between the belligerents and on the just demand that all the States of the area recognize the lawful and sovereign existence of the State of Israel within secure borders clearly defined in treaties with its neighbors.159.	This Organization cannot afford to continue to neglect  as though it did not exist  the conflict in Indochina. I here endorse the prudent words of the Secretary-General when he told us that he was deeply concerned that ""the United Nations  which was created as a result of a world war in order to safeguard international peace and security in the future  appears to have no relevance to what is now happening in Viet-Nam"" [see A/'8701/Add. 1  p. 4].160.	Undoubtedly it is the duty of the United Nations at last to concern itself with the enormous humanitarian problems which arise in that area of conflict. We must be vigilant to prevent the worsening of the situation from affecting the peace and security of all mankind.161.	We consider that the peace offer made by President Nixon is reasonable: if the North VietNamese were to release the United States prisoners and accept a genuine cease-fire  the United States would withdraw completely from VietNam and would even end its military assistance to the South VietNamese. In these conditions  the future of Viet-Nam could be discussed in peace conferences and not on the battlefield.162.	If all foreign support for North and South Viet-Nam were to end  the cease-fire to be negotiated could put an end to a bloody war which for more than 20 years has been eroding the vitality of that country. Without foreign support the North and South VietNamese will find a solution to their differences  even though this may not be wholly satisfactory to a sizable part of the population. The political regime that would arise from the settlement could be no worse than the brutal bloodletting and destruction that the VietNamese have suffered for decades  in large measure because of foreign intervention.163.	Costa Rica continues to be firmly in the trenches in the struggle against all forms of racial discrimination. With the same vigor as that with which we have condemned and continue to condemn apartheid and other odious forms of discrimination which men of the white race practice against those of the black race  we also condemn the new manifestations of racism which have led majority groups of the black race to commit odious discriminatory acts against human beings of another race.164.	World public opinion is shaken by the deportation en masse of persons of Asian origin who have had their homes in Uganda. That is particularly serious when one realizes that  apart from being driven from their homes because they belong to a race different from that of the majority of the population of Uganda  thousands of human beings will be deprived of all their belongings. A mandatory deadline has been set for leaving the country  under the threat that if they do not leave their homes they will be sent to concentration camps.165.	My deleDation adds its voice to the voices of protest of other delegations and unfortunately  all too few-against this brutal trampling of the rights of the Ugandans of Asian origin. We support the British proposal that the item should be included in the agenda of this Assembly [A/8794]. We agree with the point of view stated by Sir Alec Douglas- Home  to the effect that this item should be debated without delay in the General Assembly  since the inhuman action which creates refugees is of undoubted international concern [2042nd meeting  para. 118].166.	Costa Rica  although it is a developing country with unemployment problems  is prepared  as a token of the good faith with which it acts in such matters  to receive on its soil a group of inhabitants of Uganda who are victims of the discriminatory acts of their Government. President Figueres has responded to the humanitarian appeal made by the Secretary-General with a warm message of support and with a decision to contribute to the asylum provided to those who have been expelled.167.	The Russian Jews constitute a small part of the Soviet population. Nevertheless  they have contributed to the great achievements of that great Power. They maintain spiritual links with a nation which  spread throughout the world  has decided to establish a proper home on the soil where its forefathers forged its culture and history.168.	International public opinion has come out against the restrictions imposed on the Jews by the Soviet Union with regard to free emigration to their homeland. Criticism comes not only from the enemies of the political-social regime of the Soviet Union; it comes also from many great admirers of socialism and leaders of Communist parties in various parts of the world.169.	My delegation sincerely believes that the Soviet Union would win greater respect in world public opinion if  instead of bargaining for the talents of these people  they were to yield those talents  which have forged their own culture  to a nation which is trying to build a prosperous  just and free society for its sons who have wandered throughout the world. It is  furthermore  a nation that has given constant proof of its decision to share its own achievements with the under-developed peoples of the world.170.	The State of Bangladesh came into being as a result of the resistance of a people heroically united against the most pitiless form of political repression. The Bengali nation stoically bore genocide rather than abdicate its endeavors to exercise self-determination. Now that the people have achieved self-determination  after a bloody battle  we cannot close the doors of the international community to them.171.	It is an irony that the People's Republic of China  to which entry to the United Nations was prohibited for so many years  has cast its first veto in the Security Council to prevent the State of Bangladesh from occupying its lawful seat in our Organization.172.	Costa Rica  which was the first Latin American country to extend diplomatic recognition to the new Bengali State  will enthusiastically support the recommendation it hopes the General Assembly will make for the purpose of opening the doors of the United Nations to the representatives of Bangladesh.173.	The Secretary-General  as an encouraging fact mentioned in his report on the work of the Organization  emphasizes the efforts of co-operation within the Organization in the fields of trade and development  the human environment and population. Indeed  even the severest critics of the United Nations are generous in their praise of this field of action of the United Nations 174.	This is the hour of international justice and equity. The poorer nations of the world harbor resentments born of an injustice-laden past. They wish to possess and reap the fruits of their national resources and to have their national labor well paid for  since they have to pay very well for the labor of the wealthy nations. The poor nations wish to achieve an integral economic and social growth. They cannot agree that growth should continue to favor only some small sectors of mankind or certain nations while the vast majority continues to be immersed in poverty  ill- health  malnutrition  lack of opportunity for education and under-employment of natural and human resources.175.	Let us bear in mind  as the Secretary-General warns us in his report  that to make progress in the solution of the global problems of the economic and social development of peoples ""... Governments must develop more of a concern for each other's interests  a clear sense of each other's preoccupations and a wider knowledge of the sensibilities of other Governments and cuVLmQs"" [A/9701/Add. 1  p. 5]. My delegation wishes to place on record its confidence that the highly developed nations will for their own benefit heed the demands of the developing countries. We trust that in reducing their arms expenditures they will channel such resources to the peoples that live submerged in underdevelopment and thereby co-operate with them in the attainment of a better life.176.	The United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea held in Geneva in 1958 and 1960 constituted the point of departure  and not the target  of legal developments which must bear fruit in the forthcoming United Nations conference on the law of the sea. The most important contribution to this development was given by Latin America  with its thesis of a greater extension of the territorial sea or of broader special jurisdiction for the coastal State to protect and exploit the ichthyological and natural resources of the adjacent sea and its coast.177.	The thesis that sea-hunting and fishing beyond the territorial waters of only a few miles of breadth must be governed absolutely by the principle of the freedom of the seas might have been warranted in the periods of history in which maritime resources seemed to be inexhaustible. But the use of increasingly sophisticated techniques of sea- hunting and fishing  and the building of increasingly bigger fleets  with a greater capacity to extend their activities to areas far removed from their countries of origin  brought about an irrational and wrongful exploitation of the riches of the sea.178.	That is why the principle of the freedom of the seas  which must continue to be considered untouchable for maritime and air transit  must be limited so far as the exploitation of resources is concerned.179.	In order to conserve and exploit for the benefit of the peoples of the coastal States the riches of the adjacent seas  in South America the thesis emerged that 200 miles should be the breadth of the territorial sea. At the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea  held at Santo Domingo on 7 June 1972  the more advanced concept was adopted of a patrimonial sea with a breadth of up to 200 miles.180.	In the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721  annex I  sect. 2] it was recognized that the breadth of the territorial sea should be the subject of an international agreement. It was also agreed that until such time  ""every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the applicable base line.""181.	At that Conference it was made perfectly clear that one must not confuse the territorial sea  where the coastal State exercises all the attributes of full sovereignty  with another additional and broader area  which has been called the patrimonial sea  where the coastal State exercises a sovereignty limited to the exploitation  exploration and conservation of marine resources  without jurisdiction to interfere with free navigation or with the right to lay under-water cables and pipes which any other State enjoys.182.	The 12-mile breadth is more than sufficient for the territorial sea and its purposes  which are conservation and the security of the coastal State. The complication has arisen because of the use of the concept of territorial sea for the economic defense of fisheries or the exploration and exploitation of marine resources existing in an adjacent area of the territorial sea  which can be extended up to 200 miles. Because the truth is that the jurisdiction which some South American States exercise over an area up to 200 miles  which they call the territorial sea  does not have the characteristics of full sovereignty  but is limited to the exploration  exploitation and conservation of the renewable and non-renewable resources of what was formerly the high seas. The confusion therefore arises out of giving the same name to two different things: the zone of the territorial sea  strictly speaking and there is no reason for it to exceed 12 miles and the adjacent area which can be extended up to 200 miles  where jurisdiction limited to the economic field is the only one exercised.183.	In the patrimonial sea  aircraft and ships of all States  whether coastal or not  have the right to free navigation and overflight  with no other restrictions than those that result from the exercise by the coastal State of its rights in the same area.184.	Inasmuch as recognizing a breadth of up to 12 miles for the territorial sea would include some straits  one must therefore enter a qualification to the effect that the extension of the territorial sea  and still less that of the patrimonial sea  shall in no way curtail the freedom of maritime navigation and air navigation over those straits.185.	Costa Rica reiterates at this time its support for the principle stated by the General Assembly in its resolution 2749 (XXV) that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the territorial sea and continental shelf are the common heritage of mankind.186.	The peoples of the world expect just solutions for the many international problems which beset them. For them let us try to maintain this Organization as the most appropriate instrument to preserve peace  to bring about general well-being  and to defend freedom."
"28",1678,"CSK",27,1972,"May I  Sir  congratulate you warmly on your election to the responsible post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We arevery glad that the work of this international forum will be guided this year by an outstanding diplomat from fraternal Poland and we are most pleased that you  a representative of the countries of the socialist community  have been elected to that high office.73.	It was with pleasure that we welcomed the appointment last year of Mr. Kurt Waldheim as the new Secretary-General of the United Nations. We would like to take this opportunity to assure him that he can count on the full support of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in his efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and to increase the effectiveness of its work in carrying out the basic task of the Organization as enshrined in the Charter  namely the maintenance of international peace and security.74.	Every year the General Assembly is faced with the task of analyzing and assessing the international situation and taking stock of the activities of the United Nations. However  this task should not become mere routine. We ourselves in any case welcome this occasion as a means of encouraging positive developments while exposing and rebuffing the forces of war  imperialism and reaction.75.	The delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic approaches the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly firmly resolved to support the trends towards a relaxation of international tension which have appeared recently and to support the efforts of peace-loving forces to settle controversial international problems by peaceful means. The results achieved in this area are proof that the principle of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems  a principle which has been followed consistently by countries in the socialist community  and in particular by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from its inception 50 years ago  is becoming an increasingly effective and real force in relations between States  for it is fully responsive to the aspirations and vital interests of the peoples.76.	Our delegation approaches the work of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly with a genuine desire to make a contribution to the solution of those complex and conflicting problems which developments in international relations place on our agenda at a time when the trend towards a better climate is advancing only with great difficulty and by dint of great efforts.77.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always taken an active part in the efforts of the socialist countries to ensure peace and international security. For example it has recently made its contribution to the important measure adopted by the countries of the socialist community  namely the Prague Declaration of the Political Advisory Committee of States parties to the Warsaw Treaty   which addresses itself to the major issues of the day.78.	In this regard we welcomed the outcome of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France  during which the basic principles of peaceful coexistence  which operate also in relations between other countries  were affirmed and the results of the summit talks between the Soviet Union and the United States  which affirmed as a basic principle the notion that even the most complicated problems should be solved through negotiation and not by confrontation. We also welcome the other important events that are helping to create favorable conditions for a further relaxation of international tension.79.	An integral part of the policy pursued by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is its complete support for the United Nations and its objectives  as the leading representatives of our State have frequently stated.80.	In expressing satisfaction at the increase in positive trends  we are thinking mainly of current developments in Europe.81.	Europe  which has been a constant source of ferment and conflict and in this century alone has been the epicenter of two terrible world wars  is now experiencing one of the longest periods of peace in its whole history.82.	Moreover  since the ratification of a treaty between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany  a treaty between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the agreement on West Berlin setting this positive trend in motion  the continent has been moving towards an extremely significant event  namely the conference on European security and co-operation which the overwhelming majority of European countries have agreed to.83.	We are extremely glad that the idea of an all-European conference is  in spite of obstacles and every conceivable kind of obstruction  being brought to fruition. Our Government has expressed its agreement and support for the proposal that preparatory talks should be initiated soon at Helsinki. We can only hope that all the participants will approach these talks in a business-like way with a genuine desire to hold a fruitful conference without undue delay. In our opinion the Prague Declaration of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty indicates a reasonable and realistic course in this regard.84.	We sincerely -believe that strengthening security and expanding co-operation in Europe will be of benefit to the peoples of all continents and will promote a settlement of conflict situations in other parts of the world. A new generation is emerging whose prospective healthy future must be built on a solid and reliable basis.85.	But in order to maintain permanent peace in Europe the questions which are still pending must be completely settled.86.	One important movement in that direction is the talks being held between the two German States. Their outcome should establish an appropriate foundation for normalizing relations between the two States on the basis of the principles of international law. We think that in the present circumstances no obstacles should be placed in the way of the admission of the two German States into the United Nations. There is no reason for further delay.87.	The question also arises  in connexion with efforts to regularize the situation in Europe  of creating conditions for the normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Representatives of our State have often shown goodwill in their attempt to find a path towards mutual understanding; they have also indicated that they are willing to sign a treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany which would be a starting point for regularizing relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. However  before that can be done  the question of the so-called Munich agreement will have to be settled once and for all; that agreement must be recognized as invalid from the start. The brutal Munich diktat initiated the dismembering of the Czechoslovak State  the Nazi occupation of our country and the untold suffering of our people; it also heralded the Second World War. We believe that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will take a realistic approach to this question and will help to ensure that the frontier between our countries is a frontier that will encourage constructive and peaceful co-operation; that would  without a doubt  have a favorable effect on the general climate in Europe.88.	The development of constructive relations not only with our neighbors but with other countries in Western Europe and other continents in the political  economic  scientific  technological and cultural fields is becoming an integral part of the general positive movement in Europe and throughout the world.89.	The efforts we have been making to ensure peace and security in Europe do not imply  however  that we will not do our utmost to help solve the urgent problems that have arisen in other continents.90.	This is particularly so since dangerous hotbeds of tension still exist and the cruel war continues in Indochina where the United States aggression has recently been escalated even further. The blockade of ports in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the unprecedented scale and methods of bombing by the United States Air Force are shaking the very foundations of life in the countries in that region and are bringing untold suffering to the civilian population. We strongly condemn these acts and repeat once again that we fully support the people struggling in Viet-Nam and the other peoples in Indo-China. The only way to bring peace to Viet-Nam is to respect the inalienable right of the Vietnamese people to decide their own fate freely without any foreign interference whatsoever. We fully support the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September and of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam of 14 September this year concerning a peaceful settlement of the Viet-Nam conflict.91.	Another area of continuing dangerous tension in the world is the Middle East where Israeli aggression has led to a persistent state of conflict. We strongly favor removal of the consequences of this aggression on the basis of the unconditional implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).92.	Can our Organization continue to remain a passive bystander while the Israeli Government  under cover of its protectors  persists in sabotaging the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Ambassador Jarring  and while Israel blocks all progress towards a peaceful settlement and continues its aggressive actions against the neighboring Arab countries?93.	We support the just struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable and legitimate rights. While we cannot agree to the acts of terrorism which  like the recent tragedy in Munich  only serve the cause of the opponents of a peaceful and just settlement in the Middle East  neither can we agree that anti-terrorism measures should constitute a pretext for crushing a just national liberation struggle.94.	We must put a halt to all terrorist activities throughout the world  for they only disrupt the peaceful life of ordinary people and disturb international relations  an example of this being the hijackings of our aircraft in the course of which a Czechoslovak pilot was murdered.95.	A reflection of the positive trends in present-day international relations is to be found in the talks held between the leaders of India and Pakistan  the productive results of which we welcomed. The basic prerequisite for ensuring a lasting peace and mutually advantageous cooperation between the countries of the Indian subcontinent is  we feel  the recognition of the existing realities. That means first of all the recognition of the People's Republic of Bangladesh as a separate and independent State which meets all the requirements for admission as a Member of the United Nations. The admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations would unquestionably further the realization of the principle of universality of the Organization  and it would promote United Nations activities and enhance its prestige. It is for that reason that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic fully supports the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations.96.	We also welcome the first positive results of the efforts exerted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea over many years for a peaceful settlement on the Korean peninsula. We would hope that here  as elsewhere  the progressive and peaceful efforts being made will be crowned with success. However  we cannot attain that objective simply by closing our eyes to the injustice done in the past  unfortunately under cover of the United Nations flag. It is indeed high time for the United Nations to do its part towards the early peaceful reunification of the country  without outside interference. The constant and unjustified postponing of this item cannot assist positive developments in the Korean peninsula; it only shows up the forces that do not desire a peaceful settlement in that region.97.	For the United Nations to function effectively as an instrument for ensuring international peace and security it must be constantly strengthened as a political organization capable of fulfilling its paramount purpose. The task facing this session in that particular regard is to determine whether  and if so how  the principal resolutions adopted in previous years are being fulfilled  in particular the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].98.	We welcome the initiative taken by the Soviet Government in submitting to the General Assembly a new and important item entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [A/8793]  This new Soviet item should make possible the adoption of measures which we frankly believe would be of great help in creating conditions for peacefully solving all outstanding problems  without the use of force  conditions that would eliminate the danger of war and armed conflict between States. The non-use of force and a simultaneous permanent ban on the use of all types of weapons  including nuclear weapons  would place all countries in the world on the same footing so that none of them would have any unilateral military advantage.99.	In connexion with considerations of international security  we feel we must stress the importance of the Charter of the United Nations as a permanent instrument for ensuring general peace and security. There is no way of changing the Charter that would give the activities of the United Nations a more positive orientation. There is only one way to improve the activities of the Organization  and that is to pursue consistently the purposes for which it was established and to apply creatively and implement effectively the basic principles and provisions of the Charter.100.	One of the key targets of Czechoslovak foreign policy is disarmament  which is also a top-priority task of the United Nations closely connected with ensuring peace and security. We have always participated very actively in disarmament negotiations.101.	We see the bilateral agreements between the USSR and the United States on the limitation of strategic nuclear weapons  concluded in May this year   as a significant step forward in the field of disarmament. The agreements bear witness to the fact that in disarmament  too  substantial progress can be made. However  it is essential to reach a decisive turning-point in disarmament generally. We submit that a suitable place for this might be the World Disarmament Conference  which was proposed by the Soviet Union and endorsed by the General Assembly at last year's session [resolution 2833 (XXVI)].102.	We feel that this year we could set a final date for the World Disarmament Conference and reach agreement on how to prepare for it. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is ready to take an active part in the preparatory work.103.	The United Nations is forced with the further task of assisting in completing the process of decolonization  including the complete elimination of all remnants of colonialism throughout the world in accordance with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples which was adopted in 1960. In southern Africa the gravest injustice is still being done to the indigenous populations of the Republic of South Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe and the Portuguese colonies  primarily because certain NATO Powers  in violation of United Nations resolutions  are giving extensive assistance to the colonialist and racist regimes in those countries. The General Assembly should draw the appropriate conclusions as to the seriousness of the situation from this year's report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on the implementation by Member States of the relevant United Nations resolutions [A/8723/Rev.l  chap. VII].104.	In reviewing the present-day situation in the world  we cannot overlook the problems of economic development and relations between States  particularly since restrictions are still being place on opportunities for international trade and other forms of economic relations. I am thinking in particular of the negative effects of the Western Europe integrationist groupings and the measures they have been taking which  in view of their closed nature  are impeding the development of fruitful international co-operation.105.	Socialist economic integration  on the other hand  creates favorable conditions for improving economic relations with all States  particularly with developing countries. The comprehensive program  on the basis of which the integration of States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is being intensified  attaches the highest importance to enhancing the effectiveness of a planned international division of labor and an improvement in the structure of production and in monetary and commodity relations. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue to develop mutually advantageous economic co-operation with all countries that are interested in such co-operation and that provide the appropriate conditions. Promoting the development of international economic relations on a basis of equality  non-discrimination and mutual advantage is  we think  an important task for the United Nations.106.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  consistently following a policy of peace  approaches the General Assembly's work with a real desire to make as great and active a contribution as possible to efforts to strengthen international security and curb conflicts and aggression  and to efforts to develop constructive relations between States on the basis of the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that the present-day international situation offers this General Assembly an opportunity to utilize all the resources at its disposal to strengthen and maintain the positive trends in the world. Our great common task and responsibility is to use these resources wisely  realistically and constructively."
"29",1701,"CUB",27,1972,"Mr. President  I am very happy to express the gratification of the Cuban delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly. We are happy at your nomination not only because of the skill with which you are conducting our deliberations but also because you represent the Polish People's Republic  linked as it is to Cuba by close ties of friendship and fraternal co-operation.22.	The general debate is now drawing to an end. Each year it helps to show up the grave problems confronting our peoples. From the general debate with overwhelming accuracy  we realize that the world is still confronted by the same situations as at previous sessions; that the most acute problems of the moment are still awaiting solution; that peoples still continue their indefatigable efforts to create a world based on independence  on full respect for national rights  on the eradication of social injustice and on the achievement of progress for all.23.	However  the yearly statement of those problems and their constant stigmatizing has served little purpose. The repeated efforts made here to ensure full respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter have led to but meager results. The efforts of the majority of the Members of the Organization to establish a new international order based on the principles that underlay the creation of the United Nations have come up against the attitude of the imperialist and colonialist Powers  which try by all means to perpetuate their exploitation of other peoples  to despoil them of their wealth and impose their will upon them.24.	In Indo-China  in the Middle East  in Africa and in Latin America we see taking place a unique process of open warfare without quarter between the emerging peoples and the reactionary forces which are obstinately determined to halt the inexorable march of history.25.	The aggression against Viet-Nam is still the main international problem. The crimes committed by the United States Government go beyond the limits of human imagination and beggar Nazi barbarism. The Yankees have directed against the people of Viet-Nam all the resources of a technology which serves infamy and their plans for universal enslavement and domination. The bombing of dikes and irrigation systems  the indiscriminate destruction of VietNamese towns and villages  the mining and blockading of ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  the mass use of toxic chemical substances-all these call for the most resolute and outraged condemnation by all peoples. The Government of Mr. Nixon is guilty of the most monstrous crimes. Civilized conscience and history have both condemned him for genocide  biocide and ecocide and call upon the international community to take energetic action to put an end to Yankee brutality  to clip the claws of the Pentagon  and to assure the VietNamese people of their sacred right to independence and to decide on their future.26.	There is no other solution to the problem of Viet-Nam than acceptance of the seven-point program submitted by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam. That program enjoys the support of international public opinion  which was made clear at the recent Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Georgetown  Guyana  from 8 to 12 August 1972. The Conference demanded the immediate  total and unconditional withdrawal of all North American troops  military personnel and war equipment from Viet-Nam and the cessation of intervention in that country  and called upon the North American Government to take part seriously in the Paris talks and to give a favorable response to the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam. By admitting as a full-fledged member the Provisional Revolutionary Government  the Conference evidenced its commitment of solidarity with the heroic struggle of the VietNamese people and once more affirmed that that struggle has earned the admiration and support of all peoples. In that way the countries meeting in Guyana made it clear  moreover  that the incomparable stubbornness of the Viet-Namese people which has culminated in their memorable victory over Yankee brutality constitutes  the greatest contribution to the cause of the emancipation of all countries of the so-called third world.27.	Hence  all peoples of the world joyously greet the successful achievements of the Viet-Namese fighters and hail like a personal triumph the defeat of the Yankee policy in South Viet-Nam and in all Indo-China. North American imperialism has been thoroughly defeated in its filthy war of aggression. In its insane arrogance  however  Washington goes on seeking to increase the sacrifices called for from that indomitable people. Aware that there is no alternative for them but that of total withdrawal from Viet-Nam  the Yankees are leveling everything  eradicating from the land of Viet-Nam even the last trace of life; they travel all the roads of infamy towards their diabolical aim of annihilating the people that beat them to their knees and wrecked their plans for domination. Some day all mankind will sit as a unanimous Nuremberg Tribunal in judgment on those who have thus befouled the human spirit.28.	Indignantly  therefore  we listen to the lying allegations of the head of the North American delegation  It is the last straw to have the United States try to place the responsibility for the continuation of the war on the Viet-Namese side. The United States Government never had any reason whatsoever to interfere in the affairs of Viet-Nam; it never had and never will have any right to interfere in the life of that people or of any other. The world is no longer so easily hoodwinked. It knows perfectly well that if an end is to be put to the conflict  the United States must withdraw from Viet-Nam completely and give  up its dreams of imposing the Thieu administration  the creation of Yankee intervention  on the Viet-Namese. What is difficult to understand is why Mr. Rogers comes to this rostrum to repeat arguments that absolutely no one believes.29.	To restore peace to IndoChina there must also be an end to the North American aggression in Cambodia and Laos. The solution of the conflicts in both those countries can only be possible with the acceptance of the political program of the National United Front of Kampuchea and the program of the Laotian Patriotic Front. The non-aligned countries also took a position of solidarity with the Cambodian and Laotian peoples in their struggle against imperialist aggression. The recognition of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the sole and legitimate representative of that country within the non-aligned movement constitutes yet another proof of the growing co-ordination among the anti-imperialist forces of Asia  Africa and Latin America  and a further proof of the bankruptcy of North American policy. With the restoration of its seat to the legal Government of Cambodia  the non-aligned countries not only performed an act of historic justice and confirmed their adherence to the anti-imperialist principles which gave rise to that movement  but also and at the same time recognized a fact that cannot be disregarded: the Lon Nol clique barely holding out in the Cambodian capital  kept going solely by foreign invaders represents nobody and is the deceptive shadow of a fugitive nightmare. The General Assembly must draw the conclusions from all this: it must drive out the usurpers and restore its seat to the legitimate representatives of Cambodia.30.	The Korean peninsula continues to be a source of tension in the Far East. It is indeed deplorable that once again North American intrigue has succeeded and that it has not been possible to include in our agenda the item regarding the creation of favorable conditions for the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea. Cuba reaffirms its position of principle in this matter: the Assembly must insist upon the immediate withdrawal of all North American troops from South Korea  the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea  and the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of that country.31.	A grave situation generating tensions and threats still exists in the Middle East. The Cuban position on this matter is very well known. Only the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from territories which they have occupied since June 1967  together with full respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  can possibly restore peace in that area.32.	No one can turn a blind eye to the constant provocation and hostile acts of every nature constantly being perpetrated against the People's Democratic Republic  of Yemen. This conduct is encouraged by imperialist interests  particularly North American imperialism  and by 'die feudal circles in the area  afraid as they are that the example of the Yemeni revolution might encourage the Arab masses to try to set up truly revolutionary and popular regimes.33.	The European continent  the breeding-ground of conflicts and of antagonisms throughout history  today offers a promise of peaceful coexistence. That encouraging prospect is the result of the policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries  and of their tenacious efforts for peace and international security and the establishment of relations of co-operation among the States of the region. Cuba supports the initiative of the socialist countries  led by the Soviet Union  for the holding of a conference on European security and co-operation.34.	The normalization of relations in Europe and the overcoming of tensions inherited from the last war all call for full recognition of the German Democratic Republic  a sovereign State that is destined to play an outstanding role in the world of today. For the sake of the welfare of all and the cause of international peace  an end must be put to the discrimination against socialist Germany. The admission of that State to the United Nations  and to all other international organizations  is an urgent and necessary measure which brooks no delay.35.	On the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly there are a number of items which touch upon the strengthening of international peace and security. Cuba reaffirms its support for the holding of a world disarmament conference open to participation by all States. We owe the Soviet Union a debt of gratitude for having taken this initiative as well as for its initiative with regard to the question dealing with the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the use of force in international relations.36.	Among the basic problems also to be included in the agenda is that of the elimination of military bases set up by imperialism all over the world  that are so many spearheads of its policy of expansion  subversion  domination and aggression. As Latin American examples I refer you to those set up in Panama  Puerto Rico and the naval base of Guantanamo in Cuba.37.	Cuba shares the deep interest of all nations in peace  and thus we support any measure this Organization may adopt leading to general and complete disarmament  the destruction of all nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them  the liquidation of all existing arsenals and the cessation of the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons. But in so doing we must draw attention to the fact that these efforts will meet with mighty obstacles as long as the policies of imperialist aggression and exploitation survive in the world. The peaceful endeavors of the United Nations will only be crowned with success when conditions are such that security  independence and the territorial integrity of all States  great or small  are guaranteed; and this can be possible only through the overthrow of the aggressive plans and purposes of imperialism.38.	The retrograde interests of colonialism still stand in the way of the achievement of the Declaration contained in resolution 1514 (XV). In Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde  m Angola and in Mozambique  the Portuguese colonialists  armed and supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and with international mercenaries  pirates and bandits  ruthlessly put down or fight against the liberation movements. Yet the latter respond daily with more overwhelming blows against their oppressors. The people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea are constantly on the alert  ready to turn back and put down imperialist aggressions. The masses in Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa are putting up resolute resistance against Fascist colonialists. Threats and plots by the imperialists continue against the Republic of Guinea  the People's Republic of the Congo  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. The people of Puerto Rico too  encouraged by the recent decisions of international support for their just cause  are widening their struggle against North American colonial domination.39.	By the expressed will of the vast majority of its Members  the United Nations has defined its unequivocal support fur the right of all colonial peoples to independence. Year after year  from this rostrum  the Organization constantly condemns colonialism and resolutions are adopted reiterating the need to put an end  once and for all  to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.40.	And yet  the decolonizing work of our Organization faces resistance  stubbornness and obstacles well known to all. In the last few years the alliance of the reactionary forces of colonialism and racism and imperialism has been tightened in order to stem the process of the emancipation of the subject peoples  to reduce the United Nations to impotence and to perpetuate the slavery imposed for centuries over a considerable part of mankind. The fight against colonialism has thus reached a critical stage. The General Assembly must now consider concrete measures to ensure fulfillment of its decisions in all those Territories that have yet to achieve their independence. It is now up to the General Assembly to adopt the decisions necessary to break the back of colonialist-imperialist resistance and guarantee to all peoples the exercise of their indisputable right to national independence.41.	Action by all socialist and non-aligned States must be concerted in order to overcome the fatal influence still exerted by North American imperialism and its reactionary customers. Only thus can the United Nations start along the road of effective and decisive assistance to the peoples fighting for their emancipation.42.	The Georgetown Conference defined the joint pro-gramme of the non-aligned nations for the complete and final eradication of colonialism  and very clearly set forth the reason why this disgraceful vestige of the past still survives in much of the African continent. That reason is none other than the political and diplomatic support  the financial and military backing which colonialism and racism receive from the main centers of capitalist power in the world  and particularly from North American imperialism. It is the weapons of NATO that shoot at African fighters. It is the Western monopolies  primarily Yankee ones  which exploit the natural resources of the colonies and swell their bank deposits with the blood and sweat of the enslaved masses. It is the pressures and maneuvers of the Western Powers which hamstring action by the United Nations in favor of the oppressed peoples.43.	For nations with an anti-colonialist mission  which constitute the great majority of this Assembly  the choice could not be simpler: either they yield to imperialist pressure and slow down the process of liberation  or they attack more vigorously so as to isolate and overthrow the imperialists and put an end to colonialism everywhere.44.	There is no other choice but to redouble our militant solidarity with all national liberation movements and give them all the political and material assistance they require to see their struggle culminate in victory. For us  enemies as we are of colonialism  the liberation movements are the rightful rulers of the colonial territories; it is they who have the sole right to assume international legal representation of their peoples  it is they who comply with the terms of the Charter and United Nations declarations  and it is they who deserve the full support of this Organization.45.	My delegation is gratified at the recent decisions taken with regard to the Portuguese colonies and Puerto Rico by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples because they reflect the determination of that important organ fully to implement the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly and to ensure the emancipation of all those Territories which have not yet achieved their independence.46.	We also rejoice at the important decision of the Georgetown Conference to give seats as observers at future meetings of the non-aligned nations to national liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  League of Arab States  and the Socialist Party of Puerto Rico.47.	We are entirely in agreement with the decision taken by the Fourth Committee at its 1975th meeting last 27 September to invite as observers the representatives of liberation movements. Cuba considers that representatives of all the subjugated Territories should participate in the work of this Assembly  both in the committees and at the plenary meetings  when items dealing with colonialism  including item 23  are being discussed. No one can challenge the authority of the spokesmen of the combatant peoples to take part in decisions touching on their own future.48.	The Special Committee resolution recognizing the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self- determination and independence and instructing its working group to undertake a study of the specific steps required to implement the Declaration in resolution 1514 (XV) regarding that Territory [see A/8723/Rev.lt chap. I  para. 85J constitutes an overwhelming and crucial victory for the universal cause of the campaign against colonialism. For 20 years North American imperialism barred the doors of this Organization to the case of Puerto Rico. To maintain that situation  the United States Government resorted to all kinds of pressures  maneuvers and ruses. For 20 years it imposed on this Organization a silence of complicity permitting brutally to stifle the liberating decisions of the Puerto Rican people. For 20 years the United States stood in the way of the fulfillment by the United Nations of its duty regarding Puerto Rico  spurned each and every one of the anti-colonialist decisions adopted here  deceived world opinion  and acted out the grotesque farce entitled ""Associated Free State"" which the racist regime of South Africa is now borrowing to introduce in the Territories which it usurped and now oppresses and plunders. To do this  the United States violated the sovereignty of some Member States  terrified the fearful  broke the resistance of the weak and bent the will of the timorous. Today it still continues its wretched behavior. It still tries to snatch their victory from the hands of the Puerto Rican people.49.	Cuba is confident that this Assembly will approve the report of the Special Committee [Al8723jRev.l] and thereby authorize it next year to adopt and implement decisions regarding Puerto Rico. Few peoples in the world have earned such a clear-cut right to international solidarity as the people of Puerto Rico. In an unequal contest with an incomparably more powerful enemy  kept isolated from the general movement which led to American independence  the prey of all the furies of empire  the Puerto Rican people  the Boricuas  never yielded to their colonizers' assaults. Puerto Ricans offered this continent the longest gaoled political prisoners: Oscar Collazo  Lolita Lebron  Rafael Cancel Miranda  Andres Figueroa Cordero  Irving Flores  Bernardo Diaz Diaz  Juan Antonio Cruz Colon  Rafael Molina Centeno and Manuel Mendez Candia. Prisoners for over two decades  they are the living symbols of the unbreakable rebellion of that people. For keeping intact the spirit of their struggle  those nine patriots remain incommunicado  subject to all sorts of harassment  the victims of a hateful penal system. Among them there are some of great age  others whose health is precarious. We cannot delay the mobilization of all anti-colonialist forces to demand urgently from the North American Government the immediate liberation of those fighters  who sacrificed themselves for the ideals of independence long before this Organization proclaimed them. We must not allow the hatred of the colonialists to be vented.again on nine heroes who  with unparalleled courage  fought to defend their country's right to independence. Their imprisonment is a disgrace to the anti-colonialist principles so solemnly proclaimed by this Assembly.50.	Puerto Rico  a Latin American nation which is an inseparable part of our common country  will one day be independent. The last of the Latin American nations to be held under the colonial yoke  subjected to more intense exploitation by the monopolies than any other  made a military fortress of imperialism  subjected to the most execrable techniques of oppression  threatened with total absorption: Puerto Rico and its cause deserve the widest and most generous support.51.	While seeking support  the Puerto Rican people continues its struggle  continues its unflagging pilgrimage towards independence. It has covered a long road since the day when Bayoan  the Indian of the first endeavours  discovered that the white man was not immortal. It will continue along that road until it is able to prove that Yankee imperialism is also not invincible.52- Assistance for the independence of Puerto Rico was a key part of the liberating strategy of Simon Bolivar and a constant theme in the teachings of Jose Marti. For any self-respecting Latin American it is still a duty not to be shirked. Cuba for one will continue unhesitatingly to do its duty  both within and outside this Organization.53.	Cuba and Puerto Rico were merged by history in a single destiny. A century of lonely fighting together under twin flags sealed the single commitment that would link them for ever. In 1893 Jose Marti defined this union as follows:""In the days to come those of Ponce and San Juan will fall in Yara and the Guasimas  and those of Cuba will fall for Puerto Rico.""54.	Antagonism between peoples and their oppressors in Asia  Africa and Latin America has reached its most crucial moment. From that struggle will emerge the world of the future  which is already dawning in the socialist countries today  free from exploitation and exploiters. To achieve liberation and to secure their rights the peoples must confront reactionary violence-sometimes brutal  sometimes subtle  but always cruel. Thus to say the least it is unheard of that an item on terrorism should be suggested for inclusion in the agenda  as though that phenomenon did not have very clearly defined roots  as though ""its causes were not known to all  as though violence in the world today were a geometrical abstraction with neither explanation nor content. Cuba has already made known its views regarding this unacceptable maneuver and in due course will continue to fight against both it and any other stratagem used in this Organization to combat the revolutionary movements.55.	International attention is focused increasingly on Latin America. We are living through decisive moments; we are shaken to the very costs by the liberating current that travels through our shaken geography with increasing speed. But we also confront threats and dangers which must keep us constantly alert.56.	The heroic and tenacious efforts made by our people to consolidate our independence and exercise self- determination in different ways call for and deserve the solidarity of all the peoples of the world.57.	Fraternally we greet and support the Chilean people and the Government of Popular Unity which  under the direction of President Salvador Allende  is resolutely addressing itself to the acts of intervention  pressure  intrigue  sabotage  reprisal and threats from North American imperialism  whose latest act was the arbitrary embargo on a shipment of copper decreed by a French court on the shameless insistence of the Yankee monopoly  Braden Kennecott  which itself has for years siphoned off the fruits of the sweat and sacrifice of the Chilean workers. That criminal economic aggression is a shameful violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the most elementary tenets of international law. We must protest most energetically against this disgraceful affront by Yankee imperialism  trying by most unscrupulous means to undermine and curtail self-determination and the economic development of Chile and other under-developed countries.58.	Cuba welcomes and supports  with fraternal identification  the Peruvian people and the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Force and its President General Juan Velazco Alvarado  who continue with determination along the difficult road towards full recovery of national sovereignty  to regain the wealth of the country and to operate the economic and social transformations that will create the conditions and bases for a new life that will benefit the great majority of its peoples which for centuries had been dispossessed and exploited. My delegation is proud to proclaim that the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and Peru and the increasing strengthening of the ties of friendship and co-operation between our two peoples and Governments are a milestone in the process of Latin American liberation  independence  unity and progress.59.	We are equally at one with and welcome the unceasing struggle of the people and the Government of Panama in their claim to sovereign rights over the Canal Zone and in defense of their territorial integrity.60.	Hie events taking place in those three countries are an unequivocal symptom of the fact that Latin America is no longer prepared to submit to the shackles of subordination or oppression by foreigners.61.	I do not believe it vain to stress again that the position of Cuba regarding North American imperialism and its puppets in Latin America and the Organization of American States [OAS] is and will remain firm and unchanging. We say again that we have nothing to negotiate or discuss with the Government of the United States. We demand and do not discuss-the withdrawal of the United States from the naval base in Guantanamo. We demand an end to the blockade and to subversive action. But as the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government Commander Fidel Castro has stated again and again  apart from these unshakable demands  Cuba  can never talk with the YankeeGovernment until the latter gives up its self-appointed role of so-called policeman of Latin America  and until it puts an end to its criminal aggression against the people of Viet-Nam.62.	Once again we reaffirm that Cuba is ready to renew or establish diplomatic relations only with those countries of Latin America that are truly independent and sovereign and that fight to reconquer their national rights  such as Chile and Peru  which  despite the shameful efforts of the North American Government  have assumed that initiative precisely in the exercise of their independence and sovereignty. Once and for all  we state that Cuba will never return to the OAS  a discredited instrument of the North American domination over Latin America. In a word  Cuba will never undertake negotiations of any nature at the cost of its principles.63.	The international community must condemn the imperialist maneuvers and efforts to interfere in the decisions adopted or to be adopted by Latin American peoples in full exercise of their sovereignty and in order to meet their legitimate national aspirations. The activities of the North American copper companies  whose holdings were nationalized by the Chilean Government  on organizing economic reprisals against that country  are inadmissible acts of aggression against a developing country that call for the most vigorous repudiation from the Assembly.64.	On this point I should like to read two paragraphs of the Georgetown Declaration. That Declaration was approved by 58 foreign ministers of non-aligned countries on11	August of this year:""The Conference examined the situation in Latin America and expressed full support of the Chilean Government of People's Unity bent upon consolidating their national independence and building a new society of the nationalist measures taken by the Peruvian Government of Peru and its efforts to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and to promote social progress; and also of efforts of the people and government of Panama to consolidate their territorial integrity. The participants welcomed the growth of the efforts being made by the Latin American peoples to recover their natural resources  reassert their sovereignty and defend the interests of their countries. The members agreed that the realization of Latin America's full and true independence is an essential element in the general emancipation process of the developing countries and in the strengthening of international peace and security.""""The Conference expressed its full support tor all those Governments which  in the exercise of their sovereign rights over the natural resources of their countries  have nationalized the interests of powerful foreign monopolies and restored them to their peoples in the interest of their welfare and national development. The Conference  moreover  condemned all pressures  threats and reprisals against those countries  and pledged itself to foster mutual co-operation among developing countries so as to impart strength to their national endeavor to fortify their political and economic independence."" 65.	Cuba proclaims its full solidarity with all revolutionary movements that are tearing off the halters imposed on the peoples of Latin America by North American imperialism and parasitical oligarchies. Fighting in their own stronghold the main enemy of the peoples  they are making a decisive contribution to the general process of the emancipation of the third world and the cause of international peace and security. The struggle of the Latin American people therefore calls for mass solidarity by all progressive and revolutionary forces. It is surely a duty to support those peoples that arm themselves to obtain freedom  and those that face the repressive brutality of Fascist tyrannies in Brazil  Argentina  Bolivia and Paraguay. To contain the rising waves of revolutionary movements  imperialism organizes counter-revolutionary repression and erases the borders of States. In that fratricidal undertaking it specifically conscripts Brazilian torturers who  overcome by wild delirium  strive to play the role of a minor partner in the North American imperialistic undertaking of subjecting our peoples.66.	But neither directly nor through the services of hired henchmen can Yankee imperialism dam the revolutionary torrent  nor divert our peoples from the road they are on. The bell has rung for Latin America. Our peoples  formerly mere chattels in history  are now beginning to write it. In the past we suffered history; today we create it with our own hands.67.	Latin America is the stage of the intense stubbornness of imperialism confronting the equal stubbornness of the peoples for so long subjected to it. It was in our continent that the first practices of neo-colonialism were essayed. The peoples of Indian America  dark-skinned half-breeds-which Jose Marti called ""our America""  to distinguish it from the ""wily North""-had conquered their political sovereignty with the sword and the machete at the cost of incredible feats  but they quickly saw that independence was an empty shell  that their countries were still the prey of greedy monopolies that seized their factories  devoured their lands  conquered their mines  and put their national dignity in chains. Peoples imbued with fruitful cultures  the heirs of long and rich traditions of unity and struggle  inhabitants of a continent teeming with natural resources  became the vassals to misery and backwardness  divided by imperialism into feudal holdings.68.	The imperialist torturer lorded it over our lands; the Yankee marines trampled our beaches and outraged our sovereignty; the proconsuls of the North dissolved governments  dictated policies  and administered countries  which had now become colonies and factories. It was the period of the ripe fruit  the seemed backyard  the docile neighbors; but it was also the time of incessant struggle When our peoples lost their best children in their efforts to obtain their full emancipation.69.	In the Caribbean the Yankee imperialists started their career of villainy  excess and violence. On our beaches they tested their weapons and began to build their empire. They snatched Cuba and Puerto Rico; they controlled the Antilles  and they fell with more force than ever on the lands of the South. Jose Marti  who understood more than anyone the tenor of the times in which he lived  foresaw the future and called on the peoples of Latin America to fight for their second and true independence.70.	It  too  was destined to be born on the shores of the Caribbean. With the liberation of Cuba in 1959 there began the new and inexorable process of the destruction of an empire that 50 years earlier had first laid its foundations in Cuba. The Cuban fighters who  on the sands of the Playa Giron  made the Yankees suffer their first American defeat  were opening a new era for our continent; behind their rifles stood an anonymous mass of workers and peasants  of Indians and half-breeds  who had been enslaved for centuries  always humiliated  still unrecognized. It was they who would now march with the decision of those who suddenly find their own strength  with the inspiration of peoples that never bent the knee until final victory was achieved.71.	To Cuba fell the historic privilege of starting the historic march and pointing out the road. Destiny placed this task on the shoulders of a small people inhabiting a very tiny island  lacking natural resources  separated by geography from the rest of its brothers in blood. But it was no coincidence that our small island had been the minute homeland of Marti. The Cuban people knew how to repel aggression  to turn away provocations  to overcome a total trade and economic blockade and the isolation from a world that was and always would be its own. My country drew strength from the inexhaustible quarries of revolutionary ideas. It was always aware that it has a historic mission to perform: that it must be the bulwark of the revolutionary  internationalist principles of Latin American solidarity.72.	People and Government are as one in the immense tasks undertaken; with increasing rhythm the Cuban revolution moves towards the full achievement of its economic  social and cultural objectives. From 1971 industrial production has shown growth rates. Despite being afflicted by natural disasters  agricultural production has also increased gradually. Success in the field of the infrastructure has been significant  particularly regarding building of all kinds. Educational policy  both conceptually  based on the unification of work and study  and materially bespeak a real revolution that is already yielding its first fruits. Forty-four basic secondary schools have been started in the field since 20 September 1971. The rate at which schools are built is also increasing daily.73.	More than 100 school-construction brigades are working assiduously to build basic secondary schools  poly-technical schools  schools for teachers  technological institutes and schools for vocational training. It is estimated that by 1980 we will be able to bring into the area of work and study more than a million young people  as well as tens of thousands of teachers and educational cadres. As far as public health is concerned Cuba leads the rest of Latin America  as was recognized at the recent Conference of Ministers of Public Health in Santiago  Chile. The development of the sugar cane industry is also being carried out with true impetus in Cuba.74.	The domestic financial situation has also undergone a healthy transformation. Through its principled policy  the expansion of its international relations with all continents and its fraternal ties with the countries of what is called the third world  as well as the socialist countries and  above with the Soviet Union  Cuba has laid down and strengthened an international position of which it can justly be proud. Our immediate and long-range prospects  in a word  could not be more clear or more promising.75.	We also note with joy today that Latin America is firmly heading toward full liberation. Throughout the continent rebellion is growing  resistance is spreading  peoples are rising to recover their wealth  to consolidate their independence  to wipe out North American tyranny in one word  to carry out the revolution.76.	But it will not be an easy struggle. North American imperialism will not yield with grace a world that it has despoiled at will. To keep that world it will use all its maneuvers; it will unleash its power and give free rein to its ferocity. But side by side with that process  there is growing in the very heart of imperialist power itself  a new and growing progressive movement that is anti-imperialist and socialist. In his statement of 28 September  the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government Commander Fidel Castro  stated:""We too will be as one with our revolutionary brothers in the United States  as we were with Angela Davis  as we are now  speaking out for the liberation of Billy Dean Smith  and as we will be  with all North American revolutionaries.""77.	Latin America will triumph. No one and nothing can now hold back our peoples because our march is encour-aged by and imbued with the memory of entire generations sacrificed to prepare the dawn that is now breaking and because they are called into battle by the immortal example of Ernesto Che Guevara  the undisputed commander who from the very heart of America lights the way  and is a shining beacon guiding our steps to final victory."
"30",1747,"CYP",27,1972,"Mr. President  the delegation of Cyprus takes particular pleasure in associating itself with the previous speakers who have extended congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This election is a just recognition of your great personal qualities and of your outstanding career  as well as of the important place that your country occupies in international affairs. I wish also to express our full confidence that  under your wise guidance  the deliberations of this session will lead to fruitful conclusions. May I on this occasion add my delegation's deep appreciation for the effective manner in which your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  carried out his functions during the past session.111.	We meet at a time when the political climate of the world shows the first definite signs of auspicious improvement. Two years ago  on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  the world outlook was rather dismal. The period since then has seen significant developments in international affairs and in the United Nations. Among the most important has been the progress achieved towards an East-West detente between the great Powers and the major achievement made in the direction of the universality of theUnited Nations when the People's Republic of China became represented in this Organization. That great country  with its rich heritage of the past and its enormous present-day potential  is already making its important contribution to the work of the Organization. Still a third signal event has been the successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June  which demonstrated world awareness of the implications of a new and vast' threat to human welfare and even human survival.112.	The East-West detente constitutes a bold move forward out of the negations of a long-standing cold war. It is reflected in recent developments  such as the ratification of the treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with both the Soviet Union and Poland. These should pave the way towards better East-West relations and facilitate the now more realistically contemplated European security conference. Within this context comes also the hopeful improvement of the relations between the two German States. In Asia also there have been noticeable accommodations: between North and South Korea; also on the subcontinent  with the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan  both renouncing the use of force in their bilateral relations; and more recently  the hopeful establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.113.	Thus what has been for many years an unchanging pattern of cold war  military confrontation and political recriminations has now entered a tentative period of contact and dialog offering the hope of more concrete results. This relaxation of tension  if continued  might be expected to create a new climate that would vitally improve the functioning of the United Nations and particularly the Security Council. As we all know  the failure of the Security Council to meet the requirements of the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security has been largely attributed to the absence of unanimity among the permanent members in the wake of the cold war. The present detente opens the possibility for better co-operation between the great Powers in the Security Council  which might lead to the desired unanimity on major issues as envisioned in the Charter. The road towards that goal may still be long and arduous  but the first important step appears to have been taken.114.	There seems to be  however  an apprehension  rightly or wrongly felt  that parallel to the detente a trend may grow towards co-operation among the great Powers outside the United Nations. The fear is that such co-operation may not strengthen this Organization in the solution of problems  but rather follow the pattern *of the nineteenth century Concert of Europe. We do not share this apprehension. Such retrograde development  ignoring the rest of the world  would run counter to the very spirit of our democratic times which  in an increasingly interdependent world  compellingly call for international organization. It would also be against the true interests of the big Powers themselves. Our belief is that an improved international climate would bring new vitality to the Security Council and strengthen the entire United Nations. This seems particularly necessary at a time when the effectiveness of the United Nations is most needed in order to cope with the immensity of new challenges that face the international community.115.	Yet there is a tendency in some parts of the world  as the Secretary-General remarks in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701[Add.l]  to downgrade the United Nations and criticize the Organization too readily for any failures anywhere. It should not be overlooked  however  that the failures are not of the Organization as such; they are failures in commitment and obligation by the Member States. For the United Nations cannot possibly produce more than it is allowed to by its Members.116.	The Secretary-General  in his introduction  further observes that the United Nations ""plays a key role in the co-operative effort to tackle long-term social and economic problems  but in the political sphere the Organization's place is more uncertain"" [ibid.  p. 1]  and invites the earnest attention of all Member Governments to this vital question. The Secretary-General thus raises for discussion the important issue of the rule of the United Nations.117.	There can be little doubt that the political function of the United Nations is in some cases disregarded by Member States in the solutions of problems and even in the maintenance of peace. Hie United Nations  however  cannot be respected in some of its functions while ignored in others without its authority being undermined. Nor can it be downgraded  as the Secretary-General pertinently points out in his introduction  without dire consequences to the world community.118.	This is a reality and an intuitive appraisal that is deeply rooted in the conscience of the world's peoples. For  indeed  the overriding influence of the United Nations in international affairs is undeniable. All nations  large or small  whether Members of the Organization or not  strive to justify their international actions by picturing them as conforming to the Charter. We believe that any occasional attitudes of disregard of the United Nations are but a passing phase in a transitional period.119.	It may be recalled  in this connexion  that we are in an era of rapid change and that the United Nations finds itself in a period of transition from a traditional world of unlimited national sovereignty to a new world of effective international authority. A decisive move toward effecting such a transition has to be made. It is therefore obvious that the United Nations cannot remain static. We feel that it is the duty of all Members not only to uphold and strengthen the Organization morally and politically  but also to contribute to its dynamic development into a positive instrument for promoting change ""effectively  humanely and reasonably"" [ibid.  p. 5]  to quote the Secretary-General  so that the international community may meet the emerging new challenges and adapt itself to the growing needs of the times. Perhaps a hopeful sign in that direction is the positive outcome of the recent United NatiOTS Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm  particularly in the sense of emphasizing the need for a reappraisal of old values and for a new global ethic.120.	Turning now to the less positive side of the balance sheet in international developments during the period under review  we find conflict in several areas of the world still unresolved and still persisting. The situation in IndoChina continues to be one of intensified war  although certain developments  including high-level contacts between North Viet-Nam and the United States  offer some hopeful indications that a way to mutual accommodation may yet be found so that this devastating war may come to an end.121.	The Middle East situation shows hardly any signs of improvement. This is a complex problem aggravated by its emotional background and the intensity of feelings and constituting by far the gravest threat to world peace and security today. It merits the concerted and urgent effort of the international community to find an agreed accommodation. In our view  a solution can and should be found on the basis of the principles of the Charter and of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. If concrete steps could be taken towards even a partial accommodation  at least on the more urgent aspects of the problem  this would help to defuse the situation and open the way to a better understanding  leading towards an over-all solution of the basic problem. My delegation stands for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242(1967). This resolution  unanimously adopted and virtually accepted by all sides  provides the basis for a peaceful and just solution of the Middle East problem. Differences in respect of its interpretation can be overcome. For the resolution in its context is clear and unambiguous. We therefore express the hope that a reactivation of the mediation of Ambassador Jarring will achieve positive results in its next round.122.	My country  Cyprus  lying within the area and having friendly relations with all the parties  is particularly interested in a peaceful  just and sound solution of the Middle East problem in accordance with the tenets of justice and the principles of the Charter.123.	I would now like to say a few words on the policy of Cyprus in the United Nations and on its own problem. Since its independence and admission to the United Nations in 1960  Cyprus as a Member State has constantly and on all occasions demonstrated its unswerving dedication to the principles of the Charter and its whole-hearted support of the Organization. As a small  non-aligned country free of any commitment to military power or political blocs  and relying on the United Nations for its freedom and security  its primary commitment has been and is to the United Nations and its Charter.124.	As to the problem of Cyprus  while it is not an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly  it falls fully within the purview of the United Nations through the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.125.	I do not propose to enter into the merits of the case at this juncture. They are well known from the lengthy discussions in this august body and in the Security Council. They resulted in the relevant resolutions  General Assembly resolution 2077 (XX) and Security Council resolution 186 (1964)s which reaffirmed the sovereignty   independence  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus; we firmly stand by these resolutions as the only sound basis for a solution. The reactivated and expanded bilateral talks  with the participation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the presence of constitutional experts from Greece and Turkey as provided in the formula of the former Secretary-General  U Thant  and put into application by the present Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim are currently taking place in a good atmosphere. We trust that  in a spirit of justice and mutual understanding  the provisions of a workable constitution for an independent and unitary Cypriot State will be worked out in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the aforesaid United Nations resolutions  in a manner ensuring a lasting solution on the positive basis of conciliation and co-operation.126.	My Government is determined to show all goodwill and explore all possibilities toward accommodation in that direction. However  constitutional provisions that create sharp distinctions and divisions among our people that  are  in whatever form  inconsistent with a unitary State and will inevitably lead to friction and conflict  will have to be carefully avoided. Thus  in a positive spirit of co-operation among its people  Cyprus may be able to become a link of unity in the world and not an arena of division and conflict. We confidently trust that in this task the Government and the people of Cyprus will have the unreserved support of all Members of this Organization.127.	We deeply appreciate the protection afforded by the United Nations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus at critical junctures and its contribution to the pacification of the island through a United Nations Peace-keeping Force  as well as its efforts toward normalization and a solution of the problem.128.	We express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General and his associates  both in New York and in Cyprus  for their dedicated and untiring efforts  which recently resulted in the reactivation of the local talks. Our thanks go also to the Commander of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus and his assistants for their devoted services. We are' grateful to the countries whose contributions in military personnel and financial assistance made possible the United Nations peace-keeping operation in Cyprus.129.	A wide range of problems is on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Old problems remain unsolved and new problems are added to them. I shall deal briefly with four main problem areas: peace and security  economic development  human rights  and environment.130.	Peace and security have been and remain major urgent problems. In the prevailing conditions of radically changed methods of war  these are problems that particularly require a new approach. Because of the unlimited destructiveness of present-day weaponry  nations can no longer effectively provide for their own defense through armaments  or ensure their cities' safety from attack and total destruction. It has become increasingly obvious that real national security now depends upon international security through the development of the United Nations into an adequate instrument for the maintenance of international peace  as envisaged in the Charter.131.	Efforts at disarmament over many decades without parallel efforts towards ensuring international security have proved fruitless. Disarmament cannot  therefore  be effectively promoted independently of progress in the peace- maintaining and peace-making functions of the United Nations. The provisions of the Charter contained in Chapter VII  which have remained practically dormant over the year  may possibly be in some way activated. Meanwhile in the present improved climate more effective efforts might be centered on the development of the existing peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  which have rendered most useful services to the cause of peace  around the world  including Cyprus. We hope that the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations will find it possible in the present improved climate to make further progress toward formulating guide-lines for such operations. These guide-lines should  however  be developed with a view to the goal of an organized system of a permanent United Nations peace force with direct allegiance to the Organization. The financial requirements might perhaps be met by the establishment of a special peace fund for the purpose.132.	The peace-making functions of the United Nations  on the other hand  also have to be given parallel attention. Article 33 of the Charter provides for the means of peaceful settlement of disputes  among which are negotiation  mediation  conciliation  arbitration and judicial decision  but  the modalities and machinery for the practical application of these means are still lacking. Such machinery  however  is indispensable if the means are to be practically applied. It is certainly true that  without the will to settle international disputes peacefully  the mere existence of the modalities will not act as magic  but their absence is nevertheless a major impediment to the peace-making progress of the United Nations. We therefore hope that this important aspect of the United Nations peace-making functions may be given equal consideration through the setting up by the General Assembly of a special committee or in some other manner.133.	Within this context falls the review of the role of the International Court of Justice  an item on our agenda [item 91]. My delegation will  as in the two previous sessions  support all efforts designed to render more effective the legal arm of the United Nations by its wider use on problems having a legal aspect.134.	Regarding disarmament proper  the primary concern has been the spiraling arms race and the ever-continuing nuclear tests underground and in the atmosphere. The dangers to the world are obvious  and the psychological influence of this arms race  apart from the tremendous financial drain involved  also has to be reckoned with. We therefore warmly welcome the important accords reached between the super-Powers in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks which have at least arrested the momentum in the deployment of defensive strategic arms. While we fully appreciate the efforts made towards this positive result  we cannot overlook the fact that these accords have not affected in any significant respect the production and deployment of new and improved offensive strategic arms. Consequently the arms race  in effect  continues unabated  particularly in its qualitative aspect. It may be recalled that the world spends $200 000 million annually for weapons of war while to the institutions of peace and social progress less than 0.5 per cent of that amount is applied.135.	We hope that in the forthcoming second round of the Strategic Arras Limitation Talks there will be substantial steps towards the achievement of an effective halt in the arms race. We also hope that agreement among all the nuclear Powers will yield a long-delayed comprehensive test-ban treaty.136.	Regarding a world disarmament conference  as pro-posed in resolution 2833 (XXVI) of the General Assembly  my Government fully supports the convening of such a conference  which we consider useful and desirable  provided it is open to all States and that it is attended by all major Powers. To be successful  such a conference will  no doubt  have to be carefully prepared not only procedurally  but also psychologically. Great hopes will be pinned on it as the last resort in the disarmament effort. It cannot  therefore  and should not fail in its main objectives.137.	Turning to the problem of world economics and the growing disparity between the developing and the developed world  the recent disappointing reports indicate the pitifully low standard of living of millions of people  while the gap between the developed and the developing countries has widened further. World population statistics showing an increase by 340 million from 1965 to 1970 point out that by far the greatest rate of increase took place in the developing countries  so that 70 per cent of the world population now lives in the developing regions.138.	The adoption two years ago of an International Development Strategy for the 1970s [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  will  we hope  make the Second United Nations Development Decade more successful than the first. Also  the recent third session of UNCTAD held in Santiago  despite its frustrations  has been wholesome in solidifying the wishes and will of the developing world. The discussion at that session of the link between development and disarmament emphasizes that only a 5 per cent shift from arms to development would make it possible to reach the target for official development assistance set by this Assembly.139.	From another aspect  technological innovations have opened up the possibility of the exploration of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction for the benefit of all mankind. The General Assembly Declaration  has established this historical principle which  if finally implemented  could release resources from the depth of the sea that could diminish the scourge of poverty in the world and substantially help to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor countries. Here is indeed a new and vast economic potential for the international community which would allow it to solve so far intractable economic problems through the establishment of a world legal order for the first time in history over a part of this earth its marine expanse.140.	In the light of the encouraging results achieved at the recent Geneva session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  it is hoped that the Committee will continue its present positive work in a spirit of constructive consensus in order to achieve a successful conference on the law of the sea which would remedy the current unsettled situation in the relevant international law and make possible concrete results toward the goal of the eventual equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed for the benefit of all mankind.141.	From the aspect of human rights  next year the world community will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is hoped that this will prove an important landmark in the quest for human rights  particularly having regard to the achievements recently made through the United Nations in that field  such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)] and the International Covenants on human rights. In this connexion  I may in all modesty mention that Cyprus had the honor of being one of the first to sign and ratify both these vital instruments for human rights.142.	Although much progress has been made toward decolonization since the adoption of the epoch-making resolution for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  the continent of Africa is still suffering from the remnants of colonialism in Angola  Mozambique and other Portuguese territories and is burdened with apartheid in South Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia.143.	Namibia is at present the only area in which there seems to be a glimmer of hope for improvement as a result of the skillful diplomatic action of our Secretary-General. This slight crack in the door of Namibia must be further opened by continued and determined action through the United Nations.144.	Cyprus  having itself emerged from colonial rule  has all along supported fully the granting of independence to colonial countries  the ending of the abhorrent practices of apartheid and stands in full solidarity with all people still deprived of their inalienable rights of freedom  independence and human rights. Concerted efforts should be made to eliminate not only colonialism  but also neo-colonialism in many parts of the world. The recent decision taken by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1721 (LIII) to study the multinational corporations is a sound initiative.145.	The problem of the human environment  global in nature  preeminently reflects the necessity for effective global control. The winds and the waves have no national character  respect no national boundaries and respond to no national pleas. They carry pollution to the remotest corners of the earth. No people and no country  whatever its geographical situation  can be immune from the dire effects of the growing destruction of the environment. The interest  therefore  is common and the duties and responsibilities collective.146.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm made a most heartening beginning toward effectively tackling this planetary problem  which was hardly even contemplated a very few years ago. We take this opportunity to express once more our appreciation to the Government of Sweden for its original initiative and effort to bring about this Conference. In its results the Conference produced more than 100 recommendations in its Action Plan   adopted a historic Declaration and recommended the establishment of a 54-nation governing council for environmental programs.  These accomplishment in Stockholm are welcome evidence not only of the resilience of this Organization  but also of the wisdom  persistence and dedication of the Conference's Secretary-General  Mr. Maurice Strong  to whom we wish to pay a lightly deserved tribute. We must not  however  merely extol the Stockholm Conference. We have to proceed in the same spirit of dedication to establish the governing council and give it the personnel and particularly the finances it requires.147.	The protection of the environment  involving as it does the very continuance of life on this globe  is a matter of such vital importance to all nations and people that no effort should be spared to obtain a consensus for appropriate measures to ensure that  while economic growth and development could proceed uninterruptedly  they would be closely co-ordinated with the adequate protection of the environment.148.	In any review of the world situation and its various problems  whether local or global  it emerges clearly that in the last analysis the only way toward their solution is through a strengthened  developed and effective United Nations. We therefore deeply appreciate the efforts of our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  who  on the same lines as his predecessor  U Thant  is wholly dedicated to the cause of strengthening the United Nations so that it may become central to the solution of international problems and to global planning.149.	We wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Waldheim for his inspired leadership  his dynamism and his untiring efforts to impart vigor and effectiveness to the United Nations.150.	In this task Cyprus pledges itself to do all within its modest means to support the Secretary-General and to exert all efforts to make of the United Nations not only the effective international instrument for peace  justice and progress in the world that it was intended to be by the drafters of the Charter  but also the world authority to cope with the planetary challenge of survival with which mankind is now faced."
"31",1937,"DNK",27,1972,"Mr. President  I am happy to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that you will guide the affairs of this Assembly with tact and impartiality  and we assure you of our full co-operation. We also rejoice in the honor thus shown your country  Poland  a country with a long record of dedication to the cause of disarmament and European detente and a country with which Denmark maintains good neighborly relations across the Baltic Sea.2.	Allow me  Mr. President  to take this opportunity also to welcome the Secretary-General to his high and exacting office. He may rely upon our whole-hearted co-operation and support in his arduous task. We are happy to witness his determination to uphold the principles of objectivity and .integrity which his predecessors have handed down to him.3.	It is a sad paradox of our time that the generally accepted need for increased and closer international cooperation is accompanied by continuing and persistent national self-assertion. This conflict between the true needs of the modern world for global rules to guide the conduct of sovereign States while respecting their individual identity on the one hand and their stubborn sense of self-sufficiency on the other illustrates the dilemma of the United Nations.4.	The choice is becoming increasingly clear: either we decide to co-operate globally so as to deal constructively and impartially with our manifold problems or we miss the opportunity of developing an orderly international society. The choice would appear to be easy; but it presupposes that we are ready to discard old and  indeed  outmoded notions in favor of a rational build-up of a human society within a universal and impartial Organization.5.	The past year has seen some good and promising features. In the political field  progress has chiefly manifested itself in the relations of the major Powers and in the continuing development of a detente in Europe. In other areas of political confrontation the picture is more diffuse. Despite the often active involvement of the United Nations far too many problems remain outside what the Secretary-General has called the emergence of an era of negotiation  dialog and contact. Throughout the year  and not least in recent months  we have  moreover  witnessed acts of atrocity and random terror that threaten the very fabric of a civilized community.6.	In the economic  social and humanitarian fields  actual progress may seem limited and it certainly remains inadequate. Nevertheless  the Organization is demonstrating both imagination and drive in these spheres. And that should not be under-estimated  because it is through such means that a global community in the proper sense of the word may gradually be established.7.	First of all  a turning-point in United States-Soviet relations was reached through the successful outcome of the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in May. The favorable impact of this development on the general international situation is obvious. In Europe it is already manifest. We hope and trust that the spirit of accommodation and co-operation will prevail.8.	When we consider that for over 20 years there was practically no contact between the United States and China  it is a matter of great significance that the basis for direct communication has now been established and is being developed. We may now hope for an improvement of the international situation  particularly in the Pacific area.9.	It must be fair to assume that we have seen only the beginning of an era of negotiation. In saying that  I do not intend to minimize the vital  legitimate interests at stake  nor do I suggest that the problems involved can easily be solved. But these recent developments may be taken to prove that the major Powers have realized that in international affairs nothing compares favorably with an agreed solution.10.	In Europe the trend towards detente and increased co-operation is gaining momentum. The ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union  and between the Federal Republic and Poland  and the Berlin agreement concluded by the four Powers  have prepared the ground for the opening this autumn in Helsinki of multilateral talks preparatory to the conference on security and co-operation in Europe.11.	It is of course premature to anticipate the results of that conference  but in the opinion of the Danish Government the project holds far-reaching new aspects and potentialities. Since the conference will cover security as well as co-operation  we for our part would wish it to deal also with the problem of freer movement of people  ideas and information. For if we do not begin to tackle these problems we shall not be able ultimately to break down the artificial barriers between governments and peoples.12.	My Government hopes that negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will soon result in a general agreement satisfactory to both parties  thus paving the way to a normalization of their relations with other countries and also with this Organization.13.	In other parts of the world there are also trends towards improved relations between countries which have so far been divided by serious differences. The Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan of 3 July 1972 is an example of two Governments seeking agreed solutions in the face of obvious difficulties. We hope that in spite of recurrent complications the spirit of Simla will prevail  thereby improving conditions on the subcontinent as a whole and not least for the new State of Bangladesh.14.	In this connexion let me emphasize that Denmark firmly supports the application of Bangladesh for membership in the United Nations [A/8754]. It is most unfortunate that the Security Council has not been able to agree on a recommendation  and we urge that the Council reconsider the case. We hope  therefore  that a solution will be found during this session that will render Bangladesh full justice  help to create improved conditions on the subcontinent and be beneficial to our Organization.15.	In Korea promising developments are under way. After years of serious disagreements in the wake of war the Governments of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have initiated contacts in order to tackle and in time  it is hoped  solve the many problems dividing them. In 1971 the Danish Government supported the postponement of a debate on the Korean question in the hope that a dialog might get under way. The agreement embodied in the Joint Communique of 4 July this year [A/8727  annex I] justified this hope. We therefore felt that the best contribution which the United Nations could make at this stage towards the peaceful reunification of Korea would be' to refrain from an acrimonious debate which could only hamper the efforts of the Korean peoples themselves to find a solution to their problems. Denmark  which already has diplomatic relations of long standing with the Republic of Korea  is taking concrete steps now with a view to developing contacts also with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.16 Even if progress in the fields of disarmament and arms control leaves much to be desired  the spirit of detente is discernible.3 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971.17.	Denmark welcomes the agreements on the limitation of strategic arms which have so far been concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union.  We hope that the continued negotiations between the two Powers will lead to further results in this vital field.18.	As for the question of a complete ban on nuclear tests  I should like to reiterate that it would seem as if bridging the gap in the question of verification were mainly a matter of policy. The Danish Government urges the greatest nuclear Powers to lend their indispensable co-operation to the preparation of a complete test-ban treaty  thus taking the lead which it behoves them to take by virtue of their power and responsibility. Intensified efforts should now be made to obtain  in the near future  a complete ban on chemical weapons. We welcome the endeavours which the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has made so far in this field  and we hope that the Committee will be able to present concrete and satisfactory proposals to the next session of the General Assembly.19.	Denmark welcomes the prospect of a world disarmament conference  trusting that it may serve to promote progress and bring about constructive results. Clearly  in order to achieve that end  the conference must be thoroughly prepared and enjoy wide support in the international community  particularly on the part of all nuclear Powers. We hope  therefore  that the General Assembly will be able to decide on the preparations for such a conference. My Government would be willing to take rm active part in such preparations.20.	So much for the positive trends in the present international situation. If it is justified to say that they dominate the picture  it is nevertheless a deplorable fact that in some cases the possibilities of negotiation have not been exploited to the full.21.	In Viet-Nam the war is still raging  and there is no immediate prospect of peace. The inconclusiveness until now of almost four years of negotiation is tragic in its consequences for the long-suffering population of VietNam. The misery and the losses caused by the war and by the recent escalation and extension of the warfare  and in particular the. massive bombings  have deeply upset the Danish people. The conflict in Viet-Nam must be solved through a political settlement guaranteeing the Vietnamese people their right to decide their own future without any kind of external interference.22.	In the Middle East political efforts have been deadlocked for a long time  and the recent tragic events at the Olympic Games created further complications. They should not  however  be allowed to jeopardize endeavors to reactivate political efforts aimed at a just and lasting peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We reaffirm our full support of the mission of Ambassador Jarring under that resolution and we urge all the parties concerned to cooperate whole-heartedly in such efforts.23.	Like previous sessions  this General Assembly is faced with an almost total absence of progress towards the solution of the serious problems of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa.24.	The only exception is Namibia  where the Secretary- General  under the mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council  has been able to establish contacts with the parties concerned. It is to be hoped that this initiative will promote a solution of the question of Namibia based upon the self-determination of the people. But at this early stage it remains to be seen whether such a hope will be justified.25.	The past year saw the rejection by a majority of the population in Rhodesia of the proposals for a settlement which  it was felt  did not meet just expectations. In the. present circumstances there is no alternative to the policy of sanctions. It is to be hoped that the membership in its entirety will live up to its obligations under the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council in this matter. One lesson has been clearly reaffirmed: any solution of the Rhodesian question must be acceptable to the population as a whole.26.	In the present situation we must assist victims of the conflicts stemming from the continuation of apartheid and of colonial rule. This is in accordance with the best humanitarian traditions. Denmark for one has increased its humanitarian and educational assistance to oppressed peoples and groups in cases where the Security Council has called for such assistance or has stated a case of oppression. Our assistance may be rendered through international organizations as well as through liberation movements.27.	A most alarming aspect of the present international situation is the threat against the rights and the security of individuals stemming from the rising tide of terrorism and senseless acts of violence. Such acts are also a menace to the very foundation upon which friendly and peaceful relations between nations are based. International co-operation is required to reverse the current trend towards terrorism  and all nations must recognize their responsibility in this field. The Danish Government for its part is ready to participate in realistic efforts to eliminate this threat to mankind.28.	The most immediate practical measures which could be taken would be to safeguard the security of civil aviation. In this field a legal basis for countermeasures has already been established  and I fully support the call of the Secretary-General for the ratification by all countries of the three existing international Conventions relating to crimes against civil aviation.29.	It is most deplorable that even States are violating the rights of security of the individual. This year we have witnessed the massacre of groups of people. We have seen arbitrary expulsion of large numbers of people from their country of domicile. We also deplore rigid limitations on the right of the individual to leave his country on legitimate grounds. There is an urgent need for all countries to accede to and to respect the various instruments on human rights adopted by the United Nations.30.	Permit me now to make a few comments on the role of the United Nations in promoting economic and social progress. Measured against the lofty ideals which marked the beginning of the first United Nations Development Decade  the progress made in the economic and social fields cannot but be considered starkly insufficient by those millions who are still suffering from undernourishment  unemployment and lack of education.31.	However  over the years  our knowledge of the complex nature of development has grown  and more and more aspects of the development process have been included in the international co-operation for economic and social progress which has evolved under the auspices of the United Nations. During 1972 two major international conferences bore witness to this expanded international co-operation  the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [VNCTADJ  held in Santiago in April and May 1972  and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June 1972.32.	Considering that the months preceding the session of UNCTAD saw the most acute crisis in international monetary and trade relations since the Second World War  the results of the Conference were  in the view of the Danish Government  far from insignificant. Thus  agreement was reached on the principle of full and effective participation of developing countries in the decision-making process of the international monetary system as well as on the principle of participation of all developing countries in the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATTJ. Another important achievement of the third session of UNCTAD was its demonstration of world solidarity with the least developed among the developing countries. We are satisfied that steps have already been taken to ensure action in these areas in accordance with the recommendations of the Conference.33.	The Stockholm Conference on its part made us more conscious of the limits to growth and of the need for protection and improvement of the human environment in order to safeguard the quality of life. Although conceptions of the nature and the urgency of these problems differed from one group of countries to another  the Conference succeeded in arriving at important recommendations for future collective efforts. We trust that this General Assembly  comprising the full membership of the United Nations  will be able to approve the report of the Conference without disturbing the very delicate balance which was obtained in Stockholm. The problems covered by the two conferences-although of overriding importance are but elements in the total challenge facing us in the economic and social field.34.	Within the United Nations family of organizations international co-operation is taking place to solve a wide range of other crucial problems such as population growth  urbanization  industrialization  social security  employment  nutrition and health. The steady expansion of human knowledge creates new problems and demands. It is the task of the Economic and Social Council to analyze these trends  to propose new ways of co-operation  to ensure coherence of policies and to co-ordinate work. We support the steps which have been taken during the last year to make the Council more fit to assist the developing countries in their struggle for economic and social progress and to advance scientific and technological co-operation among all Member States. The Danish Government continues to attach great importance to the role of the United Nations family of organizations in the field of development aid. It is our hope that there will be increased recognition among developed countries of the particular advantages to the developing world of these multilateral programs. As stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  the objective of development must be to bring about sustained improvements in the well-being of the individual. My country is confident that the United Nations will have an ever-growing role to play in common efforts towards this goal.35.	I feel bound to make a somewhat discouraging observation about our Organization. In spite of the importance which Member States attach to the proper functioning of the United Nations it has not yet been possible to find a solution to its financial crisis. It is the joint responsibility of all Member States to find a speedy solution of this problem  and the financial implications should not present any major obstacle to such a solution. Some countries  among them Denmark  have already years ago made voluntary financial contributions. It would seem as if determined endeavors by the membership in general are long overdue. We therefore hope and urge that the Special Committee on the Financial Situation of the United Nations be enabled to present a proposal in the matter to this session of the General Assembly. A solution of the financial problems is one prerequisite for a better and more efficient United Nations. But it is not the only one  and not even the most important one. If we are to achieve the purposes of the Charter it is necessary that Member States adjust their policies and their behavior to the principles of the Charter and that they be prepared to co-operate fully in. their application. This is the only valid way to strengthen the United Nations for the benefit of the international community. It is a question of the political will and vision of all Member States.36.	I have deliberately set aside of the conclusion of my statement the all-important preoccupation of the Danish Government at this very moment: the entry of Denmark into the European Communities. The Danish Government has signed the agreement of accession to the European Communities.  The Danish Parliament has approved this agreement by an overwhelming majority. The final decision will now be taken in a referendum to be held Monday next  2 October. My Government trusts that the Danish people will ensure the entry of Denmark into the EuropeanCommunities as from the beginning of 1973. The firm position of the Danish Government in this matter is accounted for by important political as well as economic reasons. Politically  after centuries of rivalry  instability  political tensions  and sometimes even war  European countries have agreed to co-operate and thus preclude any recurrence of that unfortunate state of affairs. The Danish Government looks forward to playing its positive role in such a co-operation  which in our view should concentrate on problems of immediate concern to the European countries and avoid duplicating discussions which could more naturally be conducted in other forums-for instance in this forum.37.	Economically  Denmark's accession to the European Communities will make for economic progress and for a rise in production-not an end in itself  but a prerequisite for the continuation of a policy of reforms designed to improve conditions for the entire Danish population. In improving economic and political conditions in Europe  co-operation in the enlarged European Communities will be beneficial to the international community as a whole. It will provide opportunities for greater stability in the monetary field  for increased world trade and for increased aid to developing countries. Therefore  I for my part look upon the ""Yes"" which I trust the Danish population will voice next Monday as not only a contribution to regional co-operation; I see it in the broader context of the demands of international cooperation."
"32",1983,"DOM",27,1972,"Mr. President  first of all I wish to convey to you my congratulations on your election in the certainty that your wisdom and your qualities as a statesman and a student of the problems which affect the international political scene are guarantees that the tasks before us will lead to effective results to the satisfaction of all peoples of the world.117.	An outstanding thinker of the Antilles and foremost sociologist propounded the thesis that the moral progress of peoples runs in the opposite sense to the course of their material progress. That sociological concept applies to the successive periods of the history of civilization.118.	In the world of today we are witnessing technological and scientific progress of such dimensions that we could almost say that it has outstripped man's fantasy  which has always been governed by his tremendous imagination. Thus we have come today to the invention of destructive weapons which could wipe out the human race; and  similarly  with the arrival of man on the moon we can say that we have entered upon the stage of the domination of outer space.119.	Today  almost everyone concedes that at this juncture in civilization  material progress  spurred by science  has changed the characteristics of a natural process in man that is to say  the structure of the individual and collective mentality.120.	It would be difficult to forecast how far nations can be carried by the undeniable  realistic postulate which suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between material progress and moral progress in society today.121.	From those considerations we could reach the view  which has been repeated since ancient times  that truly man is his own worst enemy. Hence the idea of domination at the cost of destruction and war has still not disappeared.122.	The work done by the United Nations to achieve peace and eliminate the scourge of war  the events that have occurred and the actions that have been taken from the San Francisco Conference to the present day to avoid the spreading of wars beyond the areas of conflict leave no doubt about how exposed nations find themselves to ruin and the violence of a third world war  perhaps of nuclear dimensions  which would wipe out any vestiges of a society which was always in ferment but which in the depths of its being cherished a noble vocation for peace. Here again  this is a threat that we all view with trepidation  because  despite the years that have passed and the efforts that have been made  we have still not been able to avoid the international tensions which appear to be the major enemy to peace.123.	The picture that I have just sketched is  as we know  in no way encouraging  and it should not really be presented here by the delegation of a country small in territory such as ours; rather it should be presented by the great Powers  which inevitably govern the destinies of mankind. However  as we are fully aware that all States are equal  and as experience teaches us that ideas are the heritage of all mankind  we are repeating a concern which we know is shared by a large part of mankind.124.	We should add to the foregoing considerations that we are convinced that these facts alone are not the only cause of the abnormalities which exist in the international order.125.	It is possible that in the world of today there exists a specific causal divisive element which makes possible this imbalance between moral progress and material progress in the world in which we live. We are referring specifically to the crisis in law. Thus we see that the more we progress towards the development of legal standards  enshrined in treaties and conventions  the weaker and more ineffective they become in the enforcement of those norms  thus ensuring the necessary maintenance of peace and reasonable coexistence. Take  for example  the failure to observe treaties setting forth a lofty humanistic vision of man  specifically in international conflicts  as has occurred in the case of the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war  on inherent rights  on smuggling and the illicit traffic in drugs  international delinquency aggravated by the hijacking of aircraft and many other violations of the law.126.	From these considerations we conclude that if such things are happening in the international community it would not be at all venturesome to assert that the obstacle which stands in the way of peace and the elimination of international tensions is  as we have already stated  the crisis in law.127.	We have recognized that this is not the sole cause of the anguish in which we  the peoples of the world  live  but we cannot deny that such a crisis has a great deal to do with the fact that viable solutions are not being found to the problems whose solutions are the direct responsibility of the States involved in a dispute  as well as of the United Nations  which is the repository of the most powerful machinery which we can count upon for the solution of such conflicts.128.	It is not incumbent upon us to spell out in terms of doctrine a policy of such magnitude in order to break the vicious circle in which we find ourselves confined. It is certainly up to us  however  to organize  to find a way out of the critical realities with which we are confronted today  and we could discover the way out if there were a meeting of the minds on the necessity to work out a system to restore confidence  without which no permanent peace is possible.129.	Despite the conviction that this is a difficult task and that many paths will have to be smoothed in order to reach this system of security  to which reference has been made so many times by so many voices in this hall  it is equally certain that specific sacrifices are required which will test the real desire for peace which prevails in the world today.130.	One of the methods that my delegation considers would be effective would be the one referred to in resolution 2864 (XXVI)  which empowers Member States to take positions on ""means of enhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations"". We are convinced that an enhancement of these methods would be a step forward towards the possibility of reaching a point where we could work out the system of security to which we have referred.131.	But we must recognize that the desired enhancement of the methods to improve the efficiency of the Security Council would require a revitalizing of certain fundamental instruments available to the Council. Accordingly  my Government stresses the criterion that the Charter should be revised in respect of the provisions on the right of veto.132.	We are absolutely certain that it will be impossible to increase the efficiency of the Security Council just so long as we do not remove from the Charter a privilege which is at odds with the very essence of democracy. We say this because  far from being a notable step forward in the features characteristic of our era  which is typified by its revolt against old structures; this privilege is in itself an archaic institution. Perhaps it was justified when the victorious Powers were laying the foundations of this world Organization and wished by the veto to rule out alternatives for international equilibrium.133.	However  we would agree that the method should be attenuated in such a way that this exceptional right should be exercised only in circumstances in which we obviously face the alternative of a conflict that could endanger world peace.134.	The Dominican Republic  which has always been known for the support it has given to the predominance of human rights in our Organization  is firmly convinced that never before has our civilization been under a greater obligation to make freedom and dignity for man a reality. Accordingly we cannot possibly concede that States may infringe or make conditional the respect for and protection of the inherent rights of the human person. It is not difficult to understand that there can be no freedom where these rights are infringed.135.	For all of those reasons my country is opposed to acts of violence in all their forms of social upheaval; hence we reject the attacks which  like the one which took place recently in Munich  constitute acts of barbarism that are the ""fruit of the most savage form of terrorism""  as our Chief of State  H.E. Joaquin Balaguer stated. This is all the more true when by such acts innocent persons who are not involved in the motives that blindly lead people to take up arms and engage in destructive activities become the victims.136.	In a period of such tremendous progress  such as that which has been made in the field of human rights  we cannot close our eyes and remain indifferent to the recent tragic events which occurred in the emotion-torn Olympic Village. For this reason  my Government could not fail to give its support to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of item 92 concerning measures to prevent international terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms  in the conviction that  in addition to energetic protests  there will emerge from this hall the necessary action to put an end to such horrendous acts.137.	Nor can we fail  on this occasion  to refer to the development process which is under way in the Dominican Republic today  in accordance with the plans that are being pressed forward by our constitutional Government with relentless vigor.138.	While it is true that one of the reasons for the state of anxiety in which mankind is living today is a result of the crisis in law  it is equally true that the most effective way to deal with this situation is to obtain balanced development for all of our peoples. Hence  the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI  who said: ""Development is the new name of peace"". This message has reached all peoples with great conviction and force.139.	Accordingly  at this time  my Government is deeply involved in the most thoroughgoing revolution' of our structures which was ever recorded in the history of Hispaniola  with the introduction and implementation of the Agrarian Code which sets up the machinery to hand over to the farmer the land that he cultivates and to take from over-greedy hands the principal sources of the wealth of the Republic.140.	My Government hopes that after having doubled the per capita income of our country after barely six years  we will be able in a few years to continue to develop our vast wealth of resources which heretofore has been practically unproductive  so that we can continue strengthening the soundness of our democratic institutions and uproot  once and for all  the causes that have led to such frequent upheavals as are recorded in the history of the Dominican Republic.141.	As another trend within this spirit of progress which pervades the Dominican Republic  we can point to the importance that my Government has attached to the conclusions that are summarized in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721  annex I  sect.2]  a basic document of the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea  which was held in Santo Domingo from 5 to 9 June and which was attended by 13 Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean region.142.	On that occasion our attention was devoted not only to the problem of the exploitation of the resources of the sea  but also towards everything that is required to preserve the species as an inseparable aspect of the fundamental question of exploitation. Thus we were also able to contribute to a subject matter which involves the human environment  a matter to which this Assembly is to devote special attention. We were trying thereby to take one more step forward in respect of the complicated problem of pollution and development.143.	For those reasons it would be most appropriate if we could succeed at this session in persuading the countries represented here to find concrete solutions while we prepare effectively to apply the principles already accepted under existing conventions on the problem of the contamination of the sea  which affects us all  aware as we are that we shall have to find adequate solutions  in view of the interrelationship between pollution and the whole process of the development of nations.144.	The importance and the dissimilarity of the items on the agenda of this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly explain the interest felt by the foremost leaders of the world in finding day by day solutions more in accordance with the reality in which we live. Hence  after objective analysis of the importance of youth today and  above all  noting the fact that more than half the world is less than 25 years of age  the United Nations has endorsed this categorical statement: ""The young generation is a segment of the population whose needs are growing day by day and whose contribution to development is vital.""145.	As we are all aware of the responsibility that devolves upon us within this Organization to exert our efforts to work out national development plans  there is nothing more urgent for the full discharge of this duty than to incorporate youth in the serious tasks of renewal and development. Therefore we view with great satisfaction the fact that we are going to discuss the question of youth  its education  its principles  its needs  its active participation in development and international co-operation.146.	We have seen with great hope how in this past decade youth has begun to play a decisive role in the inevitable process of transformation of our social  political and economic structures and how efficiently it is carrying out its great responsibilities.147.	We can assert that we are witnessing today a phenomenon characteristic of this century and that the time will come when the new generations will have to inherit this world Organization  at which time we are sure they will champion the most cherished hopes of past generations.148.	The coming generations recognize that the United Nations is the repository of the principles and ideals for which they are fighting so dynamically and wisely in order to advance the ideas of the new era. Therefore we will advocate a re-examination of policies concerning youth  in each country's national plans  so that the organizations of the world system can redouble their efforts towards the creation of new projects that will satisfy their just desires for progress.149.	In his Encyclical Letter Populorum Progressio His Holiness Pope Paul VI summarized the overriding importance of development in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of progress when he said:""All of you who have heard the appeal of suffering peoples  all of you who are working to answer their cries  you are the apostles of a development which is good and genuine  which is not wealth that is self-centered and sought for its own sake  but rather an economy which is put at the service of man  the bread which is daily distributed to all  as a source of brotherhood and a sign of providence.""150.	Allow me to conclude my statement this afternoon by adopting for ourselves this other appeal by Pope Paul VI  contained in the same Encyclical:""Government officials  it is your concern to mobilize your peoples to form a more effective world solidarity  and  above all  to make them accept the necessary taxes on their luxuries and their wasteful expenditures in order to bring about development and to save the peace. Delegates to international organizations  it depends on you to see that the dangerous and futile rivalry of powers should give place to collaboration which is friendly  peaceful and free of vested interests  in order to achieve a responsible development of mankind  in which all men will have an opportunity to find their fulfillment."""
"33",2028,"DZA",27,1972,"Mr. President  in electing you to preside over its twenty-seventh session  the General Assembly has asserted its confidence in you and no choice could have been more justified. This is a further recognition of your great country  with which Algeria enjoys privileged relations of friendship and co-operation  a country that has constantly been respected at each milestone in the history of man. But it is also a tribute to your personal worth.269.	In your delicate post you succeed Mr. Adam Malik  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  a sister and friendly nation  as close to our hearts as it is distant geographically. We would venture to tell him again how proud we were to co-operate with him and to express our admiration for the invaluable contribution he made to the prestige of the Organization.270.	For the first time  a familiar figure is absent from our debates. U Thant stepped down with all the modesty and simplicity to which he had accustomed us. However  we cannot forget his great contribution to the Organization  and we take this opportunity to express to him our gratitude for the constant devotion with which he served the cause of peace and understanding among peoples.271.	Algeria is gratified that the General Assembly elected  to succeed U Thant and to continue his work  the new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom we wish to assure of our friendship and whole-hearted co-operation. Mr. Waldheim has  we know  one of the most difficult of all tasks  but he will bring to bear the qualities of heart and mind which we know him to possess  for by the force of circumstances he is called upon to share our worries and assess the scope of our real problems. We know in advance that we can count on his understanding and sympathy. And because we are aware of the weight and complexity of his responsibilities  he can be sure today as at all times that we will support him and assist him when we can.272.	The last session of the General Assembly began under the symbol of hope and understanding  but the year that has elapsed has only confirmed the apprehensions then voiced at length from this rostrum. In fact  at a time when a healthier atmosphere seemed progressively to prevail in the relations among the great Powers  increasingly serious crises were affecting other parts of the world.273.	Without prejudging the true motivations of the great Powers in overcoming the obstacles of the cold war  we had hoped that the evolution of the world would take a new tack  where the fundamental principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations would finally be fully implemented  to the benefit of the international community as a whole.274.	Unfortunately  everyday reality dispelled that illusion. Everything contributed to strengthening that ambiguous tendency in international affairs which develops on two levels: on the one hand  the priority given to the harmonization of relations among the more advanced nations; and on the other  the complacency when it is a question of settling crucial problems confronting the peoples of the third world and bearing on their very survival and the elementary respect for the human person.275.	This is a basic contradiction. It undermines an international system which we are trying to free of the sequels of the post-war period. The initiatives taken to this end are confronted with the tacit acceptance of the law of the strongest and the rewarding of aggression. Furthermore  aggression seems to have a chosen arena inevitably and always the third world.276.	The changes during the last few years in relations between the East and West indicate a promising period of evolution. These changes  because they have done away with the difficulties of confrontation and favor the appearance and strengthening of new poles of attraction  should have encouraged a true democratization of international relations.277.	The conference on European security and co-operation  which is seen as the embodiment of this evolution marked by its first step  the agreement on Berlin  has been followed by the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany  the Soviet- United States summit conference  and the partial agreements on strategic weapons  surrounded by a framework of scientific and trade co-operation. Furthermore  the establishment of a dialog between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China and the establishment of new relations between China and Japan all create conditions conducive to a detente in Asia.278.	Thus we are witnessing everywhere a change in the outmoded structures on which world balance earlier rested. The process started in Europe will  of course  have repercussions on international relations as a whole. Such a change in the framework of discussions among partners belonging to different social  economic and political systems will obviously raise complex problems. However  the agreements which must necessarily be arrived at should not be oriented towards a redistribution of responsibilities whose consequences will once again be borne by the third world. Such a fear is all the more justified since the European detente might be reflected in an increase in tension around Europe  and  more specifically  in that Mediterranean which  because of permanent Zionist aggression  appears to be the favorite battlefield for confrontation between the two super-Powers.279.	Beyond the military alliances and their implications  the rivalry of the super-Powers keeps an area where they do not belong in a state of growing tension because of the movements of war fleets  the strengthening of bases  political pressures and economic blackmail.280.	Being a Mediterranean country and naturally concerned at what happens around it  being a non-aligned country which does not look forward to a mere equi-distance between the two extremes since it is concerned about everything that touches justice and peace  Algeria works constantly for agreements among States that seek to guarantee their security and safeguard their independence within the framework of a regional solidarity that might discourage greed and attempts at foreign domination. Basically our efforts are directed towards peaceful purposes and co-operation.281.	Within these prospects the policy of fraternity and good neighborliness pursued by Algeria with all countries of the Maghreb  since it has eliminated factors of dissension  constitutes a significant contribution to the detente in the western Mediterranean region. The involvement of traditional interests between the countries of Western Europe and the countries of the Maghreb ought to lead the former to a more correct assessment of the price paid by countries to maintain an independence that was so dearly bought by all despite the changes in the world and through the complex play of interests and to maintain a rhythm of development which has made Algeria into a dynamic and serious nation. The necessary definition of new relations between a Europe that is eager to reconstruct itself and Algeria will serve as a test for future relations not only between the European Economic Community and North Africa  but also between the more advanced nations and all those that are doing their utmost to eliminate the aftereffects of colonial domination.282.	It appears that our twenty-seventh session has opened in an atmosphere of particular excitement. Among and around us our debates have suddenly acquired a certain resonance. In other circumstances we might well have rejoiced at the renewed attention given by public opinion to our work here and drawn the reassuring conclusion that once and for all we had overcome the indifference and skepticism which thus far had been shown the Organization. Exploited for emotional and doubtless painful reasons  certain phenomena of the national resistance of a people have been isolated from their true motivations  from their objective context  from their primary causes. What is called terrorism and what  under other skies and in other circumstances  has stood for the very symbol of the vitality of a number of peoples represented here  peoples once oppressed by colonial domination  has now by some unknown conjuration of fate become a shameful stigma and naturally-according to some-a manifestation of barbarism. Therefore  when it is a question of countries which have suffered war for decades  where technological power has become the very instrument of violence  when it is a question of countries which suffer from colonialism and racial segregation  by some chance part of international public opinion seems unable to see things clearly or to differentiate between the aggressor and the victim of aggression. Need I stress again that in the world of today revolutionary violence  wherever it appears  is only the condemnation of international society and of the unjust order which prevails? Thus terrorism is not an evil in itself. It seems rather to be a symptom of the diseases afflicting the world of today. It is these diseases that we must dig out if we want  once and for all  to establish a balance that will be freed of fear and violence  because it will be based on justice among men.283.	No one is so great as to stand up as an apostle of violence  but no one can be so strong as to condemn violence when it is placed at the service of justice and freedom. Unfortunately  the world will be dominated by violence for a long time to come: violence in the behavior of States  violence in the behavior of individuals. And mankind seems to be condemned to live in constant fear. Yesterday it was fear of a nuclear confrontation between the super-Powers which might have degenerated into a general conflagration and thus wipe out the human species in one fell swoop. Today it is terror caused by peoples pushed to the limit of patience who  doomed to a slow death  to genocide  to disappearance  to diaspora  might well drag the rest of the world into their holocaust. That is assuredly a mature stage of the diseases of contemporary society  which highlights the urgency of devising a cure. We have  of course  been asked to adopt immediate measures to fight against I know not what sort of international terrorism. Could we then simply wipe out the symptoms of the disease without resolving to eradicate the taproots? If the problem of violence can itself raise  indeed justify  controversies and arguments  then the struggle for national liberation  the resistance of a people  remains today as in the past not only a right but a legitimate and sacred duty. In this specific case  to be imperative and fair  revolutionary violence is the justification of existence itself.284.	Can we merely speak of violence without thinking first of the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula? There  American intervention has reached unprecedented intensity and dimensions. Meanwhile  in its declaration of 11 September 1972  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam submitted proposals which were both new and constructive. Without doubt they represent an appreciable contribution to the effort it is making to achieve a just and lasting solution of the VietNamese problem. In proposing the creation in South Viet-Nam of a provisional government of national concord with three equal and united components entrusted with handling matters during the transitional period and organizing truly free and democratic general elections  the Provisional Revolutionary Government has again given proof of its will to find a solution to the internal problem of South Viet-Nam that will guarantee the right of self-determination to the Viet-Namese people while at the same time offering the United States and its allies a chance to put an end to their political and military commitments in honurable conditions.285.	Obviously this would allow the vicious circle to be broken  and although the Algerian problem of 10 years ago and the VietNamese problem of today are not really comparable from the point of view of origin  nature or scope  nevertheless the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government are reminiscent of the procedural agreement that was arrived at in Evian with our French partner; that agreement enabled the administering Power to disengage itself with honor and the Algerian people freely to decide its future by means of a referendum of free and democratic self-determination organized by a provisional executive body. Thus Algeria achieved sovereignty and became a country deeply attached to its national independence but open to the widest international co-operation.286.	In the same way  in Cambodia  peace is still conditioned by respect for the sovereignty of the Khmer people through the return to legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union of Prince Sihanouk  which effectively controls the country and  accentuates daily the isolation of the Phnom Penh regime  the maintenance of which is assured only by the presence of forces of aggression. Furthermore  it is clear that the Government of Prince Sihanouk is the sole authentic representative of the Khmer people and it is as such that the non-aligned nations re-established its rights among them during the Georgetown Conference. That decision is a prelude to the victory of the Khmer people; it will lead the United Nations to consider the problem of the representation of Cambodia at the right time.287.	Similarly  in Laos  the solution dictated by events as well as by law remains linked to the constitution of a government of national union  as guaranteed by the Geneva Agreements of 1954  which assure to the patriotic forces of that country their rightful and legal place.288.	Still on the continent of Asia  so beset by tribulations and war  the beginning of the dialog between North Korea and South Korea has come as a reminder and a warning to our Organization. We should give all initiatives taken towards defining the principles for the peaceful reunification of Korea free from any foreign interference the immediate attention and support they deserve. By encouraging the process which is now under way the United Nations will undoubtedly recover its prestige  tarnished during the quarter of a century during which it has served as a disguise for the intervention of the imperialist American forces and their allies. Be that as it may  the United Nations must no longer act as a cover for a military presence which it cannot control  or keep alive a commission which manifestly can never carry out its mandate.289.	The dangerous evolution of the situation in the Middle East lies at the very root of the passions which have been unleashed. Should we really be surprised that things have reached such a pitch when the effects of the Israeli aggression still exist  when the Arab territories are still occupied and the decisions of the Security Council remain a dead letter  despite the remarkable efforts of Ambassador Jarring? The time spent in the search for a peaceful settlement has only resulted in the aggravation of the consequences of the 1967 aggression. Israel has made good use of that time for its policy of conquest and provocation  carrying out a systematic zionisation of all the Palestinian lands and occupied territories belonging to sovereign States Members of the United Nations.290.	Assured of impunity and benefiting from the support of the United States of America  Israel arrogantly spurns anything that does not fit into the framework of its expansionist policy. In these conditions  what can the international community do but assume its responsibility to ensure the application of its decisions? What else can the Arab peoples do but fight for the liberation of their national territory? What else can the Palestinian people do but struggle everywhere and by all possible means to reaffirm its existence  impose recognition of its national identity and recover its usurped homeland?291.	Be that as it may  it is to turn one's back on reality to imagine that a settlement can be found in a balance of forces or by horse-trading in the demarcation of frontiers. Aware that they play a part in world affairs  the Palestinian people know today that no just and lasting peaceful solution can be devised without them  and certainly not against them. The international community also bears a weighty responsibility in that situation  but it  too  can contribute to making a settlement easier by taking into account the legitimate claims of the Palestinian people. The problem is far from simple. But that surely is not sufficient reason for ignoring it. It is not only the fate of an entire people that is at stake: it is stability and peace in that crucial region of the world.292.	The meetings held by the Security Council in Africa gave rise to perhaps exaggerated hopes on the African continent. But the specific interest shown by our Organization in the problems besetting Africa is itself an encouragement to the movements of national liberation that are struggling against Portuguese colonial domination. For once  the leaders of those movements were allowed to explain and define the situation prevailing in their respective countries and the progress they are achieving in their just struggle. The trust that they have placed in the international community should be echoed  but not merely by pious sympathy and inapplicable or ineffectual resolutions.293.	Colonial domination  racial segregation and apartheid are also elements that generate trouble and violence. This is true all over the world whenever racial prejudice rears its head among men in their relations or among peoples in theirs  but the phenomenon acquires more alarming proportions in southern Africa where apartheid has been raised to the level of a governmental policy openly applied. The many condemnations of South Africa  and universal condemnation too  have done nothing to change the attitude of the regime of Pretoria  which finds in a policy so in keeping with its racist concepts  an easy and fruitful way of ensuring increased material prosperity for the white minority.294.	As far as we Africans are concerned  this situation became worse when the regime of Ian Smith set itself up in Rhodesia. It strengthened the regime of South Africa and extended to that entire region of the continent the practices of apartheid and of racial discrimination. We are aware that the international community as a whole expressed its indignation at that rebellion  that it decided to combat it and to refuse to recognize the independence of Rhodesia until the African majority enjoyed its most legitimate rights and was able to assume its rightful role in the administration of the country. But seven years have elapsed and no satisfactory result has as yet been achieved. The Salisbury regime becomes stronger daily despite the economic sanctions adopted against it by the Security Council  and despite the efforts at negotiations with it on the part of the British Government. The latest of these efforts ended in an open failure  made public in the report of the Pearce Commission.  That report made clear the fact that the Africans in Rhodesia have a clear-cut awareness of their position and the way in which their future should be decided. If any lesson is to be drawn from these constant failures  it is that the problem of Rhodesia cannot be solved by discussions with the rebels of Salisbury  but rather by giving the African people of Zimbabwe the chance to express their views and to defend their claims. It is with their authentic representatives that their future must be discussed  and it is only with their agreement that a true solution to the problem can be found. The African countries have made proposals along these lines to the Security Council. In that other question  the culpable veto of Great Britain cannot disguise  and far less minimize  its responsibilities as an Administering Authority.295.	Through the struggles for national liberation  through the joint efforts of the independent countries of Africa in the OAU  our entire continent  with determination  is continuing its work of political and economic emancipation. But Africa is still wide open to foreign interference. The entities created by the colonial Powers to ease their withdrawal within the policy of decolonization today appear lacking and not adapted to the present situation. The systems they set up at that time could naturally be swept away in the groundswell of a youth that is aware  argumentative to an extent but insistent on what it wants  if they are not corrected and revised in time  or rather if they are not completely overhauled with serious far-sightedness  taking into account the transformation taking place and the need to re-establish relations of co-operation.296.	The failure of the third session of UNCTAD has added another reason for disillusion. This frustration is all the greater since certain problems that were considered ripe for decision in Santiago still await decision.297.	One could accept as encouraging the fact that the developing countries forced recognition of the idea of their participation in the study of a new international monetary system. But in this as in other fields  the satisfactions are more formal than true.298.	Surely  we can expect nothing from a situation where the overwhelming majority of the countries are kept outside the discussions and are expected to be satisfied with acquiescing in  and suffering the consequences of  the decisions adopted in their absence and  at times  to their detriment.299.	In the same way  the right of sovereignty represented by the recovery of natural resources should not and cannot be the subject of a challenge in the disguised form of insistence on huge compensations that cancel out the advantages of nationalization. Natural resources are an integral part of the national heritage. It is clear that in many cases their nationalization must lead to equitable indemnities  yet the volume and modalities of these can be fixed only by the domestic legislation of each country. Any outside pressure  regardless of its origin  where it cannot be termed pure and simple interference in the domestic affairs of a State  nevertheless betrays the existence of a neo- colonialist effort and thereby constitutes real economic aggression that international institutions must denounce unequivocally.300.	Ten years ago Algeria  finally liberated  acceded to sovereignty and for the first time took its seat in this august Assembly. It came in  fully confident since it knew that here it would find precious friendships that had been forged in trials and tribulations  and because they were inspired by the same aspirations that had led the Algerian people to make so many sacrifices.301.	Naturally  in the history of nations  10 years of international life can be regarded as nothing but a beginning. Yet these 10 years have been devoted  with the same faith  with the same ardor and with the same determination  to safeguarding the ideals of justice  of freedom and of peace set forth in the Charter and to promoting the economic and political progress of the Algerian people. I do not have to dwell here on the virtues of peoples. Like all others  the Algerian people has devoted itself to a constant search for its own specific path  drawing inspiration from its national realities  and to the definition of a code of ' conduct based upon understanding and co-operation among peoples.302.	Having suffered so much from war  who better than we can appreciate the benefits of peace? Having been so long kept in colonial limbo  who better than we can be attached to national independence? Naturally you can well understand the pride of my country at being selected to act as host for the next summit conference of the non-aligned nations  and this at a time when more and more important countries of the third world are represented among them. The strengthening and constant widening of non-alignment have revealed the awakened awareness of these countries and their desire to play their part in  and bear their share of  international responsibilities. If it is true that the emergence of non-alignment resulted from the separation of the world into blocs  it is equally obvious today that that political attitude is self-defining and not only by reference to some outside yardstick. Non-alignment does not lie in the choice of one position as opposed to the centers of decision that are alien to it; that would be a static position which might be justifiable in certain circumstances  but would necessarily be subject to challenge by any change in the international balance. Non-alignment today is increasingly becoming a voluntary commitment in international action and carries within it its own potential of dynamism and effectiveness. Henceforth it defines alone of force among the components of the international system  and must enjoy participation in the creation of any stable and lasting world balance.303.	Within the United Nations  the major meeting place of all nations  and together with other non-aligned nations  Algeria will continue to seek to ensure that international institutions  far from being playthings of circumstances and of the interests of the strong  must truly and objectively reflect the concern of all peoples and bear within them the safeguards for a future of justice  of progress and of peace."
"34",2075,"ECU",27,1972,"Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you very warmly on your well-earned election. Your election is a recognition of your personal ability and of the fact that you are a worthy representative of the Polish people  with whom my country enjoys the most cordial relations. It is an election that constitutes the best guarantee for success in the conduct of this session of the General Assembly.145.	Since this is the first opportunity that the Revolutionary Nationalist Government of Ecuador has had to make known its views to the General Assembly  I should like in general to indicate our main goals.146.	The Government of Ecuador wishes to effect a profound economic and social transformation of the country and to overcome the present state of backwardness and poverty in which the great majority of the people live; and we intend to do this by establishing social justice  which will ensure wide participation by all the national sectors and regions by bringing into the mainstream of the life of the country all those who have been on the fringes and by encouraging an increased and maximum utilization of the natural resources in order to achieve national objectives.147.	My Government hopes to achieve these objectives through responsible and planned action. This will obviously call for vigorous activity on the part both of the State and of private enterprise  but there will of course be a guarantee of individual rights  defense and encouragement of the rights of workers and respect for capital and investments so long as they carry out their social function. Ecuador shares the desires and aspirations of Latin America and the third world  and offers co-operation in the fulfillment of the objectives of the United Nations.148.	Ecuador  which from the very beginning of its independence has been known for its love for peace and justice  is deeply concerned over the fact that  despite the years that have elapsed and the efforts made  there are still in existence dangerous centers of friction that belie the purposes expressed by nations when they created this Organization  which was to do away with acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace and encourage friendly relations on the principle of legal equality among States.149.	It is true that if we glance back at the past and go through the pages of history where law was the law of the strongest and where acts were arbitrary  it appears to be just to recognize that the achievements of the United Nations in the few years of its existence are valuable and the balance positive. But even this is not entirely satisfactory in the light of the hunger for calm and security which the peoples of the world are experiencing  peoples who wish to live free from fear and worry  working their land or carrying out their duties without the specter of misery hovering over them and protected from the scourge of war. We must eliminate once and for all and proscribe forever the resort to force as a solution of disputes or conflicts  for that is why we have raised the peaceful solution of controversies to an ineluctable principle.150.	But there appear to be interests that threaten these aims and undermine these principles in order to keep conflicts alive  very often artificially  and viciously creating situations which lead to breaches of the peace because  by using such confrontations  they obtain economic or political advantages or they can test new instruments of war  while in their egotistical plans they set no store by human life or the sufferings of displaced populations who are bereft of their homes and cities. But this can no longer continue. General indifference or cold complacency must yield place to active condemnation  to energetic protests  to clearly defined positions which will reveal the existence of a clear and definitive desire to disavow or repudiate such acts  a feeling that must gain ground until it is shared by all the world and so becomes the symbol of our times and replaces the fatal complacency that was the hallmark of earlier ages. To that end we must work and in this crusade we must make every effort so that in the immediate future we will perfect an attitude more in keeping with the principles that must distinguish us as eager to live in peace as good neighbors  concerned only with encouraging progress and raising the standard of living of citizens all over the world. 151.	At most we might say that within this balance of terror created by the new and modern means of mass destruction we have been able to avert another world-wide conflagration  but other conflicts are kept alive or break out that are still grave disturbances to world peace even though localized. After many years of suffering and endless misery  in a true war of extermination  Viet-Nam is still fighting  tom by sorrow  sacrifice and death. It is imperative that that situation end. At least  it is encouraging to know that conversations which might well lead to the end of that brutal war are being started.152.	The Middle East  with its already too long-lasting problems  quite justifiably has attracted very special attention from the international community. We must admit that the United Nations has shown deep concern for that complex situation and has devoted much of its time to the discussion and adoption of resolutions in order to solve the problems in a manner that is just and satisfactory to all parties concerned. I cannot fail to refer to the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967)  which we believe constitutes a basis for the solution of the problem. It is the resolution that led to the Jarring mission  which is still trying to bring together the wills of the parties to the dispute. Among countries with such a long historical tradition  countries the splendor of whose cultures has been a source of inspiration for the development of all Western culture  it is most sad that the play of the interests of the super-Powers should maintain a climate so unconducive to constructive dialog. Ecuador condemns the unleashing of acts of violence and of force wherever they may occur because we recognize the supremacy of law and therefore urge a peaceful solution and a just settlement according to the unchanging truth that war creates no rights  but that the solution must eliminate from relations among peoples the threat or the use of force.153.	Ecuador reaffirms the right of Israel to a recognized and secure existence where its great  hard-working and enterprising people can live its life in safety and with faith in its future. We believe also that the Arab nations have the right to recover their own territories.154.	As far as my Government is concerned terrorist practices are to be condemned whatever their origin. For that reason my country has always condemned-and we repeat today most energetically that we are against-any attack on the integrity of States as well as against human persons. My country officially proclaimed a few days ago that ""terrorist acts have deserved and will always receive from the Government of Ecuador a most energetic repudiation."" Consistent with that formal declaration  Ecuador is convinced that  as soon as possible  there should be laid down international norms that will prevent and punish acts of this nature.155.	Confronted as we are by these painful facts  we are  however  encouraged to find that there are positive events that promise a reduction of tensions and the beginnings of constructive dialog. We are gratified that the great Powers have initiated contacts that have made possible the ""new balance of prudence""  as the Secretary-General has called it in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l  p. 1]. This dialog will doubtless make it easier to arrive at the desired understandings and the more active co-operation from which mankind expects so much. There is always a common denominator which makes understanding and coexistence possible even in the case of contrasting views.156.	From this standpoint and thanks to the agreements arrived at last year among the four Powers  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic are coming closer to understandings  on the basis of one nation and two States  and these will exert a favorable influence on Central European peace and will contribute significantly to the holding of the planned conference on European security  which will doubtless in turn be another step towards the consolidation of world peace.157.	It is also most encouraging that South and North Korea have started a constructive dialog  which has already led to agreement on certain points  as shown by their Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 [A/8727  annex 1].158.	All this is most auspicious and promises that gradually we may be able to fulfill one of the fundamental bases of the world Organization that is  universality. If thus far many factors have hindered that universality  it now is true that we can glimpse substantive changes that will make of this Organization the parliament of all the peoples of the world.159.	The existence of colonial systems and regimes is an affront to the principle of universality. This is a matter that has warranted and will continue to receive special attention on the part of the Ecuadorean Government. By historic tradition and democratic conviction  we have always opposed any political system that denies basic principles such as those of self-determination and self-government  to which all peoples of this world have a right. Consistent with that position  in all international organizations and at every stage through which this problem has passed in the United Nations  we have expressed our rejection of colonialism  which hampers the freedom of peoples  is a point of obvious friction among members of the international community and harbors dangers to international peace and security. My Government is convinced that the age of colonialism must once and for all be outlawed. That is why we would support any step that would lead to the political independence of the peoples of the Territories that are still under the colonial yoke and have still not been given an opportunity to express themselves freely. We recognize their right to become free and independent nations pursuant to the terms of the Charter and the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations.160.	Continuing with my list of imperfections which unfortunately still beset humanity despite the passage of centuries and the evolution of ideas and concepts  we must mention two stains that are still on the nations' conscience. They are racism in general and its specific form apartheid. My delegation believes that these two phenomena are not only anachronistic but also a violation  of elementary legal tenets  because it is  absurd that human beings should be differentiated on the basis of the color of their skins or that they should be discriminated against because of their race  the religion they practice or the language they speak. Surely more specific and effective action must be taken to put a final end to those practices that contradict and belie the letter and spirit of the Charter.161.	When speaking of the protection of the inalienable rights of man  we might well link these with scientific and technological progress and their economic and social repercussions. The wide gap between the developed and the developing nations  far from narrowing  daily becomes greater  emphasizing the differences between the two groups. And instead of these facts attracting the careful attention of the wealthy nations  it would appear that those nations have adopted an annoying disdain not in keeping with human solidarity or the obligation incumbent on the super-industrialized nations to channel constant and increasing assistance from the rich to the poor. While the former enrich themselves by almost geometric progressions  the latter become proportionately poorer. My country thus believes that the correct application of human rights and the respect and consideration all human beings deserve dictates that scientific and technological progress should be placed at the service of the less favored peoples so that the benefits of science will assist them too  as it has assisted others  substantially to raise their standard of living. Particularly in agricultural countries  it is necessary to modernize the cultivation systems so that the fields will yield in proportion to the effort made and thus benefit the entire community. The lack of scientific training and technological means has delayed the changes in structure that would enable these countries to keep up with present progress and meet present needs  and therefore the poorer countries face this new obstacle to their progress. But there  too  lies the responsibility of the technologically advanced countries to provide them with assistance in keeping with such requirements. To give an example  the present situation in my own country is highly interesting because we have started exporting oil  which was discovered a short time ago in the subsoil of our Amazonian region. It is our just desire to take full advantage of that wealth for the benefit of the entire Ecuadorean people  but in this as in other fields it is urgent that adequate technology be transferred to allow us to make maximum use of our natural resources and to assist the legitimate owners of this ""black gold"".162.	To the lack of technology in our developing countries  we add the lack of the financial means for planning and implementing our programs for development in our fight against poverty  unsanitary conditions  disease and illiteracy. Thus the contrast becomes even more obvious when  in the light of so many needs  we know that the arms race has been neither contained nor stemmed. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has purposefully stated: ""In fact  the arms race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before ... total world expenditure for these purposes has risen to about $200 000 million annually"" [A/8701lAdd.l  p. 3]. We know that this is one of the most important questions confronting the Organization. In its solution  many adverse factors must be overcome. But we also recognize that  because of that very fact  it must be tackled with decision and honesty in order to find a solution in keeping with the security which all hope for and which would be compatible with the co-operation that binds us all. It is  I know  not a matter that can be solved overnight. It is both urgent and necessary that good will be shown and that open minds be brought to bear so that  with sincerity and an understanding of the responsibilities  the way to tackle and solve the problem can be devised.163.	In its resolution 2833 (XXVI)  the General Assembly expressed the vital interest of the international community in finding effective means whereby to achieve general disarmament and-for obvious reasons  of course-nuclear disarmament. With full knowledge of its historic responsibility  the United Nations will this year again devote itself to considering this question when dealing with agenda item 26  on a World Disarmament Conference.164.	One of the fundamental postulates of my country is that Ecuador is a peace-loving nation  one that condemns violence. We have therefore been gravely concerned over the arms race that is one of the features of many of the nations of the world and therefore we wish to stress the importance we attach to the consideration of the disarmament item. My Government is fully aware of the complexity of the problem whose solution will be the result of a series of efforts and proposals on which all parties concerned will have to have agreed previously  beginning by the establishment of trust in international relations and belief in the value of international justice. My country also recognizes that these will be long and arduous negotiations with not a few setbacks  but we consider that  by the same token  it will be possible to achieve success if there is the will to reach understandings that will be beneficial to all mankind. We cannot begin at the end and therefore we recognize that we will have to deal prudently with the subject in order to arrive at a negotiated solution to the problem of disarmament. From all I have said it can be gathered that my Government considers it indispensable that the World Disarmament Conference should be held because doubtless it will be an historic milestone on the difficult road to the strengthening of tolerance in order to achieve harmonious coexistence among all peoples of this planet.165.	It is only just to recognize that some progress has been made regarding the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  despite the fact that the tests of these devices still continue  either in the atmosphere or underground. Ecuador has repeatedly spoken out against explosions and nuclear experiments that the super-Powers have carried out without weighing the danger of radioactive fall-out and the destructive effect of such explosions. My own and 15 other countries of the hemisphere are parties to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America because of this concern; that Treaty created an organism to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction from our continent and to implement the resolutions  declarations and purposes that define the position and the policies of Latin American nations on this important question. The concern- that Ecuador has shown regarding the continuation of nuclear weapons and our awareness of the dangerous consequences to mankind of these tests have led my country at this time  from this General Assembly  to make a determined appeal to the great Powers to put an end to such nuclear explosions and tests and rather devote those immense resources of both moneys and techniques to research which  placed at the service of man  will cure his diseases and help him in his economic and social development and assure him of an existence more in keeping with his dignity.166.	The same guiding idea of protecting man in all his aspects and manifestations inspired and dictated the position of Ecuador in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  which was held in June of this year in Stockholm. My country is deeply concerned over the problems of the environment. The more we know of these problems and the better we understand them  the more we are aware of their gravity and the urgency of finding an adequate solution to them. Convinced of this  Ecuador gave whole-hearted support to the holding of the Stockholm Conference since we were determined to try to blaze new trails in the history of mankind with the hope that we might find adequate formulas that would harmonize accelerated development which characterizes this century and links us with the environmental problems  as well as the highly noble task of shortening the distance which so greatly separates the super-wealthy from the poor countries of the world.167.	Our view was and is that we must endeavor to find the ways and means to true international co-operation  without tutor nations and without subject nations  since that would contradict the spirit and the letter of our Charter-co-operation of a nature such as to assist the so-called third world  through additional resources  to combat and eradicate the environmental problems of under-development  such as slum conditions  ill health  pollution  malnutrition  contamination of the environment and the gradual destruction of ecology  all of which force millions of persons to live in conditions that can only be termed subhuman.168.	The Stockholm Conference opened a door to hope. The General Assembly now has incumbent upon it the responsibility of channeling that thought expressed by the international community and thereby to strengthen the achievements of the Conference and thus make reality of the motto ""Only One Earth"" that ruled the debates among the participants.169.	In contrast with the obsolete concept of the extension of sovereign rights over the sea solely in order to ensure the defense of a nation  there arises the truly constructive and dynamic concept of co-operation as a function of the economic and social development of peoples. And thus the proclamation of the right of States to establish the limits of their sovereignty over the seas adjacent! to their coasts in accordance with their own peculiar geographical  geological and ecological characteristics and the need for the rational utilization of their resources constitutes one of the most significant steps in the formulation of the new law of the sea. At the same time it is a positive achievement on the part of the less-developed countries to obtain for their peoples  eager as they are for progress and improvement  those means which nature placed at their disposal and which  generally speaking  in the past were exploited and utilized to increase the power and wealth of maritime nations that had nothing to do with the seas in which that wealth lay.170.	Ecuador  in accordance with these principles and consistent with the norms of maritime policy which were agreed to in 1952 with Chile and Peru in the Santiago Declaration  exercises a sovereignty whose outer limit lies at 200 miles from the base-line  and we are happy that the principle that was voiced by the countries of the southeastern Pacific was the point of departure of a wide-scale movement that today has supporters and co-operation among nations from all continents.171.	Lamentable incidents which have occurred because of the stubborn illegal action and misuse by foreign fishers who follow an old practice of exploiting the wealth of others have once again shown that to guarantee and to protect the interests of the coastal States a mere declaration of preferential or exclusive rights does not suffice. The exercise of the sovereign power of the State is necessary  especially so since the sea-and with the sea I include the water  the soil and subsoil  and their renewable and non-renewable resources-constitutes a single unit that cannot be destroyed and therefore in its integral wholeness belongs to the coastal State that possesses eminent domain.172.	The life of relations among States evolves rapidly towards new concepts and new goals compatible with the progress both of law and science. To cleave to the old concepts and to try to formulate a law of the sea without departing from the obsolete classical lines would be an insurmountable barrier to the establishment of norms which are a vital need for the international community today. Unlimited respect for the norms that safeguard order  peace and the security of States and that preserve the resources necessary for the subsistence and the progress of the peoples are not incompatible with the exercise of the rights of the community as far as transit  navigation  communication and international co-operation are concerned.173.	Thus the rights of States generate the duties of the international community and that relationship  because of the existing interdependence  in turn imposes obligations which the State cannot avoid and which constitute its duty to the community.174.	For all these reasons  Ecuador contends that the new orientations of the law of the sea  with the extension of the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the coastal State to a limit of 200 miles  fits perfectly with the requirements of the international community and allows a just relationship between what the State proclaims for itself  with the need to preserve the maritime resources  and with what interdependence requires for a better development of international life. The Ecuadorean sea is open to international communications and  far from isolating itself from the world  is a valuable element of relationship and cooperation  although we firmly oppose any act or abuse violating the interests of the people and the essential rights of our State. This same concept governs the exercise of sovereignty over the air space above the adjacent sea to a limit of 200 miles.175.	In a spirit of frank understanding and in order to contribute to a better presentation of the new norms of the law of the sea  reaffirming the respect for the sovereign rights of States and the value of the duties flowing from interdependence  my country will participate in forthcoming regional and world conferences  since we are convinced that the results to be achieved at such conferences will be beneficial to the strengthening of peace and will ensure closer co-operation among nations and the steady and speedy progress of the less developed nations  which have in the sea the ways and means of achieving better standards of living for themselves and progress for their people.176.	The existing trade systems and the monetary and financial machinery were established after the Second World War with very little participation on the part of developing nations. These were articulations designed primarily to encourage the economic growth and recovery of the developed nations. That objective has now been achieved. After 25 years a certain number of countries have become industrially and technologically super-developed  while the majority of mankind  which had little to do in the programming of the present financial and trade system  is facing the very grave problems of under-development and is living in a way that is incompatible with the present stage of civilization or the norms of coexistence and justice set up in the last few years.177.	Lately  a number of developed countries have confronted grave problems flowing from their excessive accumulation of wealth and have been forced to modify the present monetary and financial system  seeking new balances and altering the fragile rules to which the developing countries were still trying to adjust themselves in their struggle for justice and social welfare. As part of that same struggle  the countries of the third world some time ago stressed the need to transform the present  unjust structures.178.	We therefore came to a moment of grave significance in the history of international economic relations. For different and varied reasons  there still is a wide consensus on the part of both developed and developing countries that reforms should be made in the present trade  financial and monetary systems. My country believes that the best way of trying to harmonize these interests is through sincere international negotiations on an equal footing and with the widest participation of all peoples of the world. We contend  further  that it is up to the different bodies and organs of the United Nations to play a basic role in this process of negotiation. We trust that at the present session of the General Assembly a decisive awareness of this matter will grow and that the world Organization will be led to carry out its full responsibilities.179.	The solutions to be found should be wide-scale. Mere palliatives will not be acceptable  still less slight paternalistic concessions on the part of the developed nations. I say this because I recall a number of proposals or formulas put forward in the case of the law of the sea in UNCTAD and when dealing with the problems of the environment.180.	On behalf of my country  I must recall that there are very important conceptual bases and principles for international co-operation  just as there are a series of hopes and proposals submitted by the developing countries  all of which must be utilized as soon as possible in the different international organs.181.	One of those principles that warrants emphasis is the need for an equitable distribution of the benefits of trade and of co-operation among all countries  and particularly the developing countries.182.	The approval at the third session of UNCTAD of special measures to benefit the least advanced of the developing nations and of the land-locked developing countries was a very just and appropriate decision  but within that very context it is necessary that the United Nations should give the same importance to problems that beset the less advanced of the developing nations of each region.183.	Here again  I wish to repeat our whole-hearted support of the initiative of the President of Mexico regarding the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States  to which UNCTAD resolution 45 (III) refers. Scattered in different instruments and resolutions there are a number of principles governing international trade relations and the problems touching economic development. We believe those principles should be codified for international acceptance in a charter  similar to that which was adopted by UNCTAD in its resolution 46 (III).184.	On maritime transport a number of recommendations and decisions were adopted regarding the improvement of port facilities  the development of merchant marines by developing countries  combined international transport of merchandise and economic co-operation in marine transport. Ecuador is giving an effective impetus to the development of its merchant marine and therefore has in the last few months  in accordance with the international principles governing this question  put into force a law reserving certain freight for Ecuadorean vessels which we consider vital to the interests of the country.185.	We must stress the fact that we cannot speak of freedom when surrounded by poverty  or of justice when close to two thirds of mankind lives in subhuman conditions. Therefore  my country reads into the words ""freedom"" and ""equality"" necessarily an economic growth and social progress that will assure dignified standards of living for all peoples. It is obvious  therefore  that international action must be directed towards tearing down such obstacles through co-operation for development  with all necessary resources and  under soft and preferential conditions  so that the developing countries can set in motion their mass programs to deal with those problems. Therefore  although Ecuador gives the United Nations organs much support  from this rostrum I am happy to note that my country considers UNCTAD and the United Nations Development program to be instruments of such special importance in the fulfillment of the objectives of our Organization that they require more political support and greater resources for the future."
"35",2121,"EGY",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like to join my colleagues--the 115 of them who have spoken so far-in congratulating you on your election to the presidency. Under your guidance the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been carrying out its work-and will  I am sure  continue to carry it out with seriousness and the utmost efficiency. Allow me also from this rostrum to convey our warmest greetings to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  and once again to welcome our Secretary-General. It is less than a year since the then Ambassador Kurt Waldheim in this very hall took the solemn oath pledging loyalty to the Charter of the United Nations [2031st meeting]. I again wish him success. We again pledge to co-operate with him whole-heartedly  as we did with his well-remembered and respected predecessor  U Thant.98.	This annual general debate in our Assembly is  or should be  a time for a serious survey of the international actions of all Member States during the preceding year. As sovereign States  we have committed ourselves to the United Nations Charter and in doing so have willingly agreed to yield a portion of our sovereignty in order to set up this community of nations. We believe that  while each one of the Foreign Ministers is responsible before the proper organs of his country for the conduct of its foreign policy  he is also answerable to this Organization. This annual general debate should show that all Member countries have seriously tried to live by the Charter and have not violated its principles and purposes.99.	The primary purpose of the United Nations  to use the Charter's words  is:""To maintain international peace and security  and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.""	The Charter  furthermore  stipulates that Member States should unite their efforts in order to fulfill that primary purpose. Collective action  according to the Charter  is the main guarantee of international justice and peace. SuperPowers may not need such protection. The rest of us do. Some States have found themselves in need of it in the past; some have cause to seek it now; others may well need it in the future. To block this collective action and to flout the authority of the Organization is to direct a most serious blow against all of us. Do we have to be reminded of this basic and obvious principle?100.	The facts show  however  that our collective search for justice and peace is often sabotaged and frustrated. Important resolutions in this Assembly and other United Nations bodies are ignored. The effectiveness of the Organization itself is scoffed at and doubted. Our Organization seems at certain times to be surrendering to the rule of force in relations between nations. Indeed the principles and purposes of the Charter  the raison d'etre of our Organization  unfortunately now need to be reasserted. The Organization must seriously and urgently consider how to regain its authority and its effectiveness.101.	Attempts to depoliticize the United Nations have been detected for some time  especially since the ranks of the third-world countries have been further strengthened by the emancipation of our sister African and Asian States and their admission to the Organization as full Members. Some of .the more powerful States have shown their impatience and displeasure with certain of the political decisions and resolutions adopted by the United Nations. The view has been expressed that the United Nations should deal only with less ambitious matters. The Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries  meeting in Georgetown in August of this year  recognized that ""an impediment in the way of the effectiveness of the United Nations is great power tendency to ... bypass the United Nations in dealing with problems of vital importance"" and declared that ""this tendency must be resisted"". 102.	Referring to the seating last year of the lawful representatives of the great Republic of China  Mr. Waldheim  the Secretary-General  in the introduction to his report to the Assembly observed:""Indeed  it is strange that  at a time when the United Nations and its main executive organ for international peace and security-the Security Council-are becoming more representative of the power realities in the world  there is  apparently  a certain unwillingness to involve the United Nations in the reconciliation of some conflicts. ... But when long-standing conflicts create vast humanitarian problems and may affect the peace and security of all mankind  the United Nations should surely be involved in the attempt to settle them."" [A/8701/ Add.l  p. 4.]103.	The tendency by certain States to ignore the United Nations is clear. For us  to disregard such a tendency is to condone it and to endanger further the useful existence of oar Organization. All countries which wish to set their policies inside the shelter of the law of nations  our Charier  should pause and give this most serious problem the most careful consideration it commands.104.	To begin with  we must admit that our Organization itself has failed at times to assert its political authority. It is a fact  for example  that the Assembly has been reluctant to consider Article 6 of the Charter  dealing with the expulsion of a Member; it is a fact that the sanctions provided for in the Charter have seldom been imposed; it is a fact that certain permanent members of the Security Council have used or misused their veto power to block just and important resolutions and have thus frustrated the work of the Council; it is a fact that the United Nations had not yet overcome the serious difficulties that have prevented the creation of the enforcement machinery envisaged in Chapter VII of our Charter. The five permanent members of the Security Council  which  under the Articles of the Charter  have been given certain responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security  have not so far been able to agree on the creation of this machinery.105.	Over the last 12 months  since we last met here  the world has witnessed changes on the international scene. The summit meetings involving the three most powerful nations have commanded the attention  and perhaps raised the hopes  of all the countries of the world. Almost all the speakers at this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly have alluded to a new atmosphere of international detente. It is obvious that the obstacles that have blocked the effectiveness of the United Nations-for example  with regard to implementing Chapter VII and giving the Organization the necessary machinery to do so-have been caused by the tensions among the big Powers  the permanent members of the Security Council. Now that major practical steps have been taken that should lead towards an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding  should we in this Assembly not seize this opportunity seriously and honestly examine the situation of our Organization? Should we not endeavor to find suitable and agreed upon remedies for its very serious ailments? This study would focus on means to make the United Nations stronger  strong enough to protect us all. It is time to do so. It is time that we  collectively  exert all our efforts to stop the deterioration and possible collapse of our world order and of this great structure for peace. Our silence and inaction are an encouragement to the dangerous tendencies to resort to the policy of violence  the policy that ""twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". It is a crime by omission. The restoration to this Organization of its political effectiveness and its role in preserving world peace obviously needs the full co-operation of the big Powers. Those Powers  however  shall not be indifferent to the will of the world as only we can manifest it.106.	Our Charter may be humanly imperfect  yet it does not need basic revisions in order to achieve this purpose. It is we  the Members of the Organization  who need to live up to its objectives. Should we fail to do so  we may be witnessing the beginning of the end  the horrible  tragic crumbling of this Organization.107.	In his speech before this Assembly in this general debate the Foreign Minister of Israel criticized the techniques  procedures and atmosphere of this Organization as framing ""clearly not been congenial to the craftsmanship of peace"" (2045th meeting  para. 68]. The Assembly was told that all the ""successes of diplomacy in the past year... had to take place outside the United Nations framework."" [Ibid.  para. 67].108.	What are these ""real limits"" that the Foreign Minister of Israel wishes to place on the capacity and strength of the United Nations  mankind's highest achievement? They are a bold attempt to strip this Organization of its most fundamental mandate  of its role in safeguarding peace and security and of its duty to bring them into being ""in conformity with the principles of justice and international law""  as the Charter-says. According to his thesis the United Nations  set up to ensure that war and injustice would be no more  does not have it in its capacity to deal with such issues. In his concluding paragraph the Israeli Minister suggested that were the United Nations to temper ambition with restraint it might perhaps be able to play an enlarged humanitarian role. I remember our colleague Ambassador Castro  saying that we would then be a branch of the Red Cross.109.	The simple  regrettable fact is that political Zionism  having used this Organization to realize its ambition of partitioning Palestine  cannot now suffer the nations of the world looking over its shoulder and trying to arrest its preconceived and preplanned expansionism.110.	Instead of charting a mere humanitarian role for the United Nations  the Foreign Minister of Israel was certainly expected to tell this Assembly  to which he is answerable  what his country has or has not done with regard to resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly especially with regard to Assembly resolution 2799 (XXVI)  which clearly called on his Government to respond favorably to the principles of peace advanced in February 1971 by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Ambassador Gunnar Jarring.111.	That  as we all recall  was done in conformity with the mandate unanimously given to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General by the Security Council in its resolution 242 (1967) and later supported by this Assembly [resolution 2628 (XXV)].112.	But not once did the Foreign Minister of Israel mention those resolutions. Not once did he mention any resolution adopted by the General Assembly or the Security Council concerning the Middle East-not on the question of the Palestinians; not on Jerusalem; not on the occupied lands of Egypt  Syria and Jordan; not on the' barbaric attacks against Syria and Lebanon; not on the mistreatment of the population under the military rule of his Government-not once. He has  however  obliquely warned us in Egypt  in the Arab world and in the United Nations not to entertain any hope that Israel will ever be subjected to any adjudication or coercion by the United Nations or anyone else.113.	Israel instead invites the conquered countries to meet their conqueror and to discuss the size of the fruits of conquest. Israel warns that any talk about any United Nations resolutions  about any African initiative  about any possible European initiative or about any other initiative will only be met with its displeasure. Today Israel is obviously confident of the military support of the United States of America  due to which it can sustain its occupation of our lands  and confident of the political support of the United States  which would protect it against any United Nations action. The question Tel Aviv asks is  Who is going to get us to do this or get us to do that? The pertinent question it does not ask and which no power-drunk people has ever asked is  Where are the conquerors of yesteryear? Where are the phantoms of the past? Any suggestion other than to accept Israeli demands is and  we are told  always will be  rejected with disdain.114.	What is it that the Israelis so disdainfully reject? It is not a secret that they reject the resolutions of the General Assembly. It is not a secret that they reject Ambassador Jarring's aide-memoire of 8 February 1971. It is not a secret that Israel demands that the aide-memoire be dropped and forgotten completely.115.	If Ambassador Jarring were ever to withdraw his aide-memoire although that would mean that the Assembly would also have to withdraw its resolution 2799 (XXVI) of last year then  of course  our reply accepting the suggestions contained in that aide-memoire would not exist. That is why I feel I am bound  as a responsible person not only before this Assembly but also before history  to bring to the attention of this Assembly what it was that Egypt agreed to  and up to this very minute still agrees to  in its search for an honorable peace  in its battle to win peace. Please excuse my taking a few minutes to do so. We here keep referring to documents by numbers and by dates  and in the end we do not really know what those documents contain. On 8 February 1971 Ambassador Jarring handed his aide-memoire to me  and he presented it to Israel on the same day. He stated the following in that aide-memoire:""... I wish to request the Governments of Israel and the United Arab Republic to make to me at this stage the following prior commitments simultaneously and on condition that the other party makes its commitment and subject to the eventual satisfactory determination of all other aspects of a peace settlement  including in particular a just settlement of the [Palestinian] refugee problem.""Israel would give a commitment to withdraw its forces from occupied United Arab Republic territory to theformer international boundary between Egypt and the British Mandate of Palestine on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements are made for:""(a) Establishing demilitarized zones;""(b) Practical security arrangements in the Sharm el Sheikh area for guaranteeing freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran;""(c) Freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal.""The United Arab Republic would give a commitment to enter into a peace agreement with Israel and to make explicitly therein to Israel  on a reciprocal basis  undertakings and acknowledgments covering the following subjects:""(a) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency;""(b) Respect for and acknowledgment of each other's sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence;""(c) Respect for and acknowledgment of each other's right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries;""(d) Responsibility to do all in their power to ensure that acts of belligerency or hostility do not originate from or are not committed from within their respective territories against the population  citizens or property of the other party;""(e) Non-interference in each other's domestic affairs."" Ambassador Jarring added:""In making the above-mentioned suggestion I am conscious that I am requesting both sides to make serious commitments but I am convinced that the present situation requires me to take this step."" He also said that by ""security measures in Sharm el Sheikh"" he meant the presence of United Nations forces in the area.116.	Egypt's answer was ""yes"". What was Israel's answer? All those who are of my age know that for 25 years every Zionist leader  every partisan and defender of Israel  has repeatedly said that this is exactly what Israel is thirsty for  that this is why it is fighting and struggling  that this is why it is collecting all the money it can from everywhere and everyone  and that this is why it is exacting taxes from every Jew in the world. And that was given by our answer of ""yes"". However  Israel's answer regardless of how obliquely it was given-was ""no"".117.	How can the international community stand idly by when faced with Israel's defiance? ""No"" was the answer tothe General Assembly resolutions. ""No"" was the answer to the Secretary-General. The Special Representative Ambassador Jarring  got the same answer: ""No"". ""No"" was the reaction to the effort of the four permanent members of the Security Council to draw up guidelines for Ambassador Jarring. ""No"" was the answer even to the continuation of these consultations. ""No"" was the answer to the attempts of the 10 distinguished leaders of Africa last year. ""No"" was the response to the considered views of the non-aligned countries. Western European views are similarly confronted by this ominous ""No"". In short  Israel says ""No"" to everyone and everything that will not bring about submission to its will. This is a cold  calculated policy seeking to assert that in the Middle East Israel's word as the dominating power will henceforth be the law.118.	As has been repeatedly stated in previous years  the history of Palestine in the past half century reveals that political Zionism is bent on expansion in an endeavor to dominate as much of the Middle East as it possibly can. It never lacked pretexts for expansion. It does not lack them now. It will not lack them in future. Following the Second World War  humanitarian considerations were used to plead for the partition of Palestine. At that time Israel's leaders did not preach the irrelevance of the United Nations. They considered the United Nations General Assembly the most suitable and legal vehicle they could use to achieve their objectives. Talk about the necessity for direct negotiations between the parties and the inadmissibility of adjudication and coercion was not yet fashionable in those days. Considering the United Nations General Assembly as the vehicle which would give them partition  the Zionists fought for partition and declared themselves content with the resolution they got on 29 November 1947  181 (II).119.	Political Zionism -was not really satisfied with the boundaries allotted to the Jewish State in that resolution. Further expansion to usurp other parts was needed to satisfy the Zionist dream of dominating the totality of Palestine. This was brought about by terrorizing the Palestinians. Women and children were massacred  houses dynamited  villages razed. These actions were perpetrated by specially organized terror groups directed by some of the better-known Israeli leaders of today.120.	Terror and violence organized and premeditated were thus introduced by the Zionists into peaceful Palestine. On 8 February this year-exactly one year after Israel was offered peace and refused to commit itself to it-at an open meeting in Tel Aviv under the sponsorship of one of Israel's former cabinet ministers  the two men who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946  killing 95 residents  were publicly identified. They gave a press conference describing their action in detail. At that press conference  the two Israelis revealed how they had disguised themselves as Arabs  wearing Arab dress  in order to carry out this operation. Despite their open confession  the Israeli Government took no action against them and did not even criticize their public glorification. That was in February 1972.121.	There will always be a pretext for Zionist expansionism and the Israeli reluctance to face the possibilities of real peace. This year the pretext brought to this Assembly is terrorism a terrifying word. But who is using it? Who is complaining? Is it the State of Israel  a State of terrorists run by terrorists which is encouraged and protected in order to terrorize the nations around it lest they should ever decide to live for themselves  independent of colonial States. As time goes on  other pretexts are sure to be found as and when needed.122.	The Palestinian people  some two and a half million of the Middle East's most civilized and energetic people  are all now either living as third-rate subjects under Israeli domination or in sordid camps that can hardly protect them from the wrath of the Phantom jets in the hands of Israel  or else in a diaspora  promising themselves and their children never to forget or forgive  looking with bitterness and skepticism and who can blame them? -at this world and at the United Nations  and at our resolutions adopted annually during the past quarter of a century.123.	Having occupied all of Palestine  the Israelis invaded the international borders of the neighboring Arab States in June 1967. This time the pretext for the invasion and the following occupation was Israel's so-called security requirements. For Israel  security obviously means the perpetuation of a state of superiority in armaments that should ensure that the Arabs will never be able to regain anything that Israel may decide it needs or likes. With this superiority in armaments  and in pursuance of its expansionist designs  Israel has had an open-ended opportunity to effect all the changes it wishes to bring about in the occupied territories.124.	The increasingly deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian territory of Gaza is evidence of this Israeli policy. Gaza has been subjected to a premeditated policy of depopulation and change of demographic structure and geographic composition in a manner fitting Israeli expansionist plans  but certainly contravening the 1949 Geneva Convention  which strictly prohibits the establishment of settlements in occupied territories  the forcible deportation of the civilian population  the destruction of houses and villages and changes in the geographic structure and demographic composition of the occupied territories. 125.	Similar acts have been and are now being committed by Israel in Egyptian Sinai  in the Syrian Golan heights  Jerusalem and on the west bank. The reports of the Red Cross  the United Nations committees of investigation  the various articles published in the world press and the statements issued by many international humanitarian organizations all attest that the situation in those territories is intolerable. Consequently  the measures undertaken by Israel in the occupied territories have been considered war crimes and an affront to humanity by the Commission on Human Rights. The Foreign Minister of Israel calmly tells us  however  in his speech in this debate  that Israel applies humanitarian principles. Israel has  according to him  increased the number of television sets in the hands of the people under its occupation.126.	Yet we in Egypt are for peace. We are for the full implementation of all United Nations resolutions on theMiddle East. To achieve this objective and in pursuance of our determination to support the United Nations efforts  we have co-operated with the United Nations and its Secretary-General; we have extended unreserved cooperation to his Special Representative.127.	In order further to facilitate the realization of a just peace  the President of Egypt proposed on 4 February 1971 an initiative providing for the evacuation of Israeli occupation forces in two stages. The President declared that  upon Israel's withdrawal to the lines of the first stage  Egypt would be willing to accept a cease-fire for a specific period  during which the Secretary-General's Special Representative would prepare a timetable for the implementation of all the provisions of the Security Council resolution. During that stage Egypt would start clearing the Suez Canal with a view to opening it to international navigation. Egyptian forces would cross the Canal to assume their national responsibilities on the eastern bank and protect the Canal and the Egyptian cities along its side. The second stage would then follow. The Israeli occupation forces would evacuate the territories they occupied after 5 June 1967  and all the other provisions of the Security Council resolution would be fully carried out in conformity with the aforementioned time-table. The evacuation of Egyptian territory can only mean the withdrawal of Israeli forces of occupation to the Egyptian  internationally recognized  borders with Palestine under the British Mandate.128.	United States Secretary of State Rogers once alluded to these international borders as being ""some 50 years old"" that is twice the life of the Israeli presence in the area. This may be its age according to modern history  but anyone who has learned his history from a French or an Arabic book—I do not know about English books knows that these boundaries are exactly 4 250 years old  these internationally recognized borders between Egypt and Palestine  all of Palestine  which was partitioned in 1947.129.	It is relevant to recall here what two Presidents  the President of the last session of the Assembly and you yourself  Sir  said at the opening of this session. Mr. Adam Malik said:""I remain steadfast in my belief  however  that the only road to a peaceful settlement will have to go by way of strict compliance  by all concerned  with all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions adopted with regard to this problem."" [2032nd meeting  para. 13.]As for you  Sir  you said:""In the Middle East region  too  there are still no signs of a lasting peace. The United Nations has committed its authority to help settle this long-standing dispute. We have a right to demand that the will and the decisions of our Organization be respected  decisions which  if fully complied with  should bring about the solution so earnestly desired  most of all by the population of that region."" [Ibid.  para. 35.]130.	Israel's utter disregard for the United Nations and its resolutions has already been exposed by many speakers. For example  this morning the Hungarian Foreign Minister Mr. Janos Peter  has given us a short  precise expose on the question. Most of the speakers have gained our gratitude for all they have said on the matter. However  the question will be examined later by this Assembly when the items on the Middle East [item 21] and Palestine [items 40 and 42] are considered. We shall have more to say at that time. At this stage  it seems only proper to stress that merely extending views and advancing proposals would not be adequate. It also seems important to declare that to hope that the mere passage of time will bring Israel more and more concessions  other than those made to it in February 1971 and to wait for that is an idle hope. That will never happen.131.	I am confident that I need not remind the General Assembly that according to Article 1 of the Charter one of the primary purposes of the United Nations is to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the common ends. The examination of this question must lead to effective collective action to uphold our Charter. Inaction would only be condoning aggression. What is required now is the taking of action joint international action-to restore United Nations credibility and to save the United Nations as the world organ for the maintenance of peace.132.	Other important problems facing the world of today will  of course  be discussed by the Assembly. In all these  and in other problems not before the United Nations  the confrontation is between the rich and powerful nations  on the one hand  and the subjected  poor  weaker and less advanced nations  on the other. In every situation the strong and rich seem to be seeking to get stronger and richer at the expense of the poor and less advanced. This is a tragic state of affairs  a sad heritage of the pre-Charter era  showing an unbelievably retarded mentality that fails to understand that the world as a whole can never now live half free and strong and half subjugated and poor.133.	The exploiters of the valiant peoples in South Africa should be made to know that sooner rather than later Angola will be free  Mozambique will be free  Guinea (Bissau) will be free  Zimbabwe will be a sovereign African State  and Namibia will have its own representatives in this family of nations. What the rulers of Portugal and Rhodesia and the racists in South Africa are trying to do is simply to stop the irresistible winds of change. We regret the lives and energies that are being needlessly sacrificed and the time that is irretrievably lost. Vicious attempts against Senegal and Guinea have already been defeated. Left to themselves  the countries of Africa were able to put a quick end to the disputes which could no longer be fanned from outside. We rejoice in the successes obtained by the States of Somalia  Uganda  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire in their latest efforts for conciliation and peace. We hope similar successful efforts will be repeated everywhere  in all areas of tension and not in Africa alone.134.	In Asia  the movements for liberation and unity shall be victorious. In IndoChina  in Viet-Nam and in Korea the determination of those brave and ancient peoples to reach their objectives will certainly bring their struggle to a successful end. What a loss of time and lives to resort to such bombardments as those alluded to by the Foreign Minister of Sweden today-and we know that colleagues in the diplomatic missions of France and Algeria have been victims of that indiscriminate attack.135.	In IndoChina  In Viet-Nam and in Korea  I repeat  the determination of their brave peoples will bring their struggle to a successful end. An end to the era of colonialism and exploitation is sure to come everywhere. Let us all try to shorten this useless struggle. Let us welcome all these freedom fighters not only as observers  as we have fortunately decided to do  but also as full Member States.136.	The United Nations stands to gain in strength if the principles of universality are fully respected. No sovereign  peace-loving country should be barred from membership in our Organization. Divided countries wishing to join the United Nations should  and I hope will  be admitted.137.	To fight racism  efforts are currently being undertaken to launch a decade for vigorous and continued mobilization against racism and racial discrimination. We know that the majority of Member States will fully co-operate. The decade should lead to real progress towards the elimination of the miserable evils of racism and racial discrimination.138.	The economic and monetary situation in the world obviously affects the well-being and future of all States. Judging from the meager results attained during the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] it is hardly possible for the developing nations to look to their future with confidence. When we add the adverse influence of the era of colonialism to that of international monopolies  it appears that concerted action on the part of the developing world is long overdue. All developing countries should fully exercise their sovereign rights over their natural resources in order  first  to accelerate their own national development and  secondly  to strengthen their positions in transactions with foreign enterprises.139.	The economic situation would certainly be greatly improved if the fabulous sums spent on armaments were ever to be curtailed. While multilateral negotiations on disarmament have achieved a number of important agreements  their partial scope and the fact that not all countries have adhered to them has put severe limitations on their effectiveness and has caused some countries to delay their ratification.140.	The strengthening of the United Nations as an effective international machinery for safeguarding world peace and security should help the efforts to achieve these disarmament goals  goals which now seem too far away.141.	The Egyptian delegation will naturally deal with all these problems as they come up for discussion in the plenary meetings of this Assembly as well as in committee. As a non-aligned nation our attitude in those discussions will always be guided by the spirit and letter of the Charter.142.	As a member of the Arab League and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  as a Moslem and a Mediterranean country and as a non-aligned member of our United Nations  Egypt seeks to intensify its co-operation with all nations in order to live in greater dignity and freedom and to strive  in a context of peace  towards progress and advancement. This is the real test of the success or failure of our foreign policy.143.	In the 12 months since we last met in this Assembly hall  and as a step following our federation with the Syrian Arab Republic and the Libyan Arab Republic  Egypt and Libya have been studying steps towards achieving greater unity between themselves. With all other Arab States Egypt actively works for  and sincerely seeks  co-operation to the extent they desire. In order to achieve our common objectives  first  to defeat aggression  and then to accelerate our steps along the road to progress  we will not spare any possible effort.144.	In the African family we are as active as we can be in the service of the objectives of the charter of the OAU. We remember and register our gratitude for the efforts of the African States and their great leaders' endeavors last year to bring justice and peace to our land. We also express our deep appreciation  because at its last meeting in Rabat last June the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU again clearly manifested its solidarity with and loyalty to the concepts of freedom  justice and peace the concepts of both the charter of the OAU and the Charter of the United Nations.145.	Together with our African sister-States  we go on co-operating with the great and ancient nations of Asia in our wider African-Asian group  serving the same ideals and defending the same concepts.146.	We turn to our other partners in the third world  the States of Latin America  and express our gratitude and appreciation for their stand for what is legal and right and for their opposition to the dictates of arrogant power.147.	The visits that my predecessor made to some of these Latin American countries provided us with an even clearer picture of their correct and sympathetic attitudes and policies.148.	The family of the non-aligned  at their last meeting in Georgetown in August 1972   assured us again that those who wish to live by the law of nations would never fail strongly and firmly to uphold its principles in the face of any situation.149.	The situation in Europe is developing towards increased rapprochement and co-operation. This is a welcome trend  which will contribute towards promoting a more comprehensive and stable peace. The convening of a European security conference is no longer an idle dream. We are convinced that conditions prevailing in Europe are bound to affect other areas within the immediate vicinity. Instability in Europe has in the past adversely affected our region. Similarly  a stable and durable peace in Europe would affect our peace. Europe has a direct stake in a just peace in the Middle East.150.	I wish to refer in passing  but with profound personal gratitude  to the visits I paid to Rome  London and Brussels  and to the visits that my predecessor paid to the great cities of Paris and Belgrade. I hope that all obstacles will soon be removed so that our renewed relations with Bonn will be as strong and fruitful as we sincerely wish them to be.151.	All the socialist countries of Europe  as you well know  have stood  together with the Soviet Union  by our side since the 1967 aggression and have extended to us in our hour of need their unforgettable assistance. A grateful Egypt will not forget this support and will always seek to strengthen its friendship with these and all other peoples.152.	Yet Egypt has no more fervent wish than to live in freedom and at peace in a world ruled by law. We wish to develop closer ties of co-operation and friendship with all States Members  of this Organization which  faithful to its Charter  desire to live by its concepts and strive ro serve its purposes.153.	In this context  Egypt believes it to be in the interest of every nation to try to preserve the United Nations as the political organization whose main work is the attainment of justice and peace for all. Rather than placing limits on its competence  we must all seek to strengthen its role. The United Nations should remain our hope for the future  it should not be a burden from the past.154.	The general debate is approaching its conclusion. We have listened to the valuable remarks  views and suggestions made by the majority of the wise Foreign Ministers of the world and chiefs of delegations  almost all of whom have expressed their loyalty to the United Nations and its Charter  and have renewed their confidence in them.155.	At previous sessions we have been called upon  in many documents  to assert that confidence and faith: in the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] and in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  in the Declaration on the Occasion of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations [resolution 2627 (XXV)].156.	We also have before us two new items which show the concern of its authors about the same subject: we have items 24 and 25  submitted by Romania and by the USSR  respectively. In each case the motivating concern was the same  and the purpose almost identical: having fought the wars of the past  we wish to win peace for the future. For centuries in the past  nations have been subjected to the misery brought about by violence. We all look ahead now to a world advancing in peace under the protection of the law. Let us make it absolutely impossible for anyone to live outside that law."
"36",2190,"ESP",27,1972,"Mr. President  before addressing this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly  may I congratulate you on your election as President. Your qualities of energy and flexibility  understanding and experience  are a firm guarantee for the success of our work. To these words of tribute I wish to add the tribute of my people to the Polish people  to which we have traditionally felt linked by ties of friendship and understanding.126.	This session is the first to be held since Mr. Waldheim took up his duties as Secretary-General. Therefore I cannot fail to state publicly our deep satisfaction and extend our sincere congratulations to him. Since Austria and Spain shared an unforgettable period of their histories a few centuries ago  I am well aware  as a Spaniard  of the promise of success in the hard and difficult task of being Secretary-General implied by the election of Mr. Waldheim  who is devoted to the service of peace and international justice.127.	Once again voices throughout the world are bringing to this hall expressions of hope and disappointment; once again we are reckoning the balance-sheet of successes and failures  of encouraging signs and ominous portents. These expressions of light and shadow reflect not only the fact that the work of the United Nations  like every human endeavor  is marked equally by successes and shortcomings but also a much more deep-rooted and disturbing fact. We all know the aims and purposes of the Charter  but after 27 years we continue without having found the precise picture of how our Organization should act as an instrument of peace and co-operation. We all want peace  but we have not been able to find the instrument for peace. We all recognize the value of co-operation  but we have not been able to create effective tools to be placed in the hands of man to achieve this.128.	Perhaps the reason we have failed to find the proper course for this Organization should be sought in our indefinite and exaggerated appraisal of its historic role. Sometimes we have insisted on considering the United Nations as a panacea for all ills  as our universal savior. At other times we have tried to reduce it to a forum for the discussion of minor issues  a congress or seminar of modest technicians. Never have we tried to follow the middle course between exorbitant and chimerical ambition and sterile and selfish realism. Let us try to achieve realism and effectiveness within a framework of good faith.129.	It is of fundamental concern to us to achieve and preserve peace. By all possible means and from the very outset  Spain has been maintaining a consistent attitude of support for the idea of convening a conference on security and co-operation in Europe  which might serve as a useful instrument for the creation of a new order  through the acceptance of formal commitments  on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of all European States.130.	The ratification of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties  the signature of the final protocol on Berlin and the agreements signed by President Nixon during his visit to Moscow permit us to set out on the preparatory multilateral phase of the conference  in which we shall be present and animated by the utmost desire to co-operate. In this phase and in the conference itself  Spain will make every effort to ensure that the agreement which seems to be dawning on the items with which we are dealing now  with our gaze fixed on the idea of encouraging a relaxation of tension in Europe and creating conditions of true peace and co-operation in economic  scientific and cultural spheres  will be worked out.131.	As a result of this agreement  we should study the related problem of the reduction of armed forces  within the world context  looking particularly at the Mediterranean. There would be no sense in reducing tension in one geographic region in order to raise it in others.132.	For some time now heightened tension in the Mediterranean has led the riparian States to formulate an expression of the need to ensure that the system of security now obtaining in that area a balance based on mutual dissuasion between two super-Powers be supplemented through an agreement between the States whose shores are washed by this sea. We should try to grant the riparian States a growing participation in the determination of their own destiny  which is obviously the result of situations that they do not control and in whose formation they do not participate or participate to only an inadequate degree.133.	Spain  a Mediterranean country  whose history is linked to the destiny of that ancient sea  accepts these ideas with the utmost interest and co-operates in creating self-awareness and intends to consider all initiatives which  with a sense of realism and the desire to turn them into facts  may emerge in this forum.134.	In the Middle East a very dangerous situation continues  a situation of ""no war  no peace"". The international community must  through the United Nations  redouble its efforts so that an equitable and stable peace can be reached in the area through the application of Security Council resolution 242(1967)  which will take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.135.	Spain is a firm supporter of the peaceful settlement of international conflicts and repudiates the use of violence  whether it is used by States or by individuals or by national or international political organizations. But this just condemnation of violence will not be sufficient unless the causes are uprooted  unless we provide a remedy for the injustices and frustrations which engender it. Peace is not the absence of acts of violence but rather calm and order  and there can be no order when displaced populations do not see a clear future before them but see rather the shadows of a possible conflict or at all times their continued destiny as exiles.136.	From this lofty rostrum a year ago [1949th meeting] we stated that we should give special attention to Jerusalem. Spain will give favorable consideration to any efforts which may be made along these lines. Ever since 1948 the Organization has sought to find a formula that would guarantee the inviolability of Jerusalem as a Holy City. It is urgent to work out such an arrangement through which Jerusalem would preserve its character and the different beliefs could be practiced in a system of freedom  equality  security and dignity.137.	The doctrine established by the United Nations on various occasions  with the support of the overwhelming majority  recognizes the right of Spain to the decolonization of Gibraltar  which  as long as it remains in the hands of the United Kingdom  is an anachronistic residue of a colonial policy which has no meaning in current times. I can inform this General Assembly that throughout this year the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom and I have held three full and frank conversations  which we intend to continue.138.	The Spanish Government hopes that the United Kingdom will understand the necessity for these conversations as quickly as possible to lead to a negotiated solution which will put an end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar and restore the territorial integrity of Spain while respecting the interests of the people of Gibraltar. Thus it would become possible  looking towards the future and not to the past  to have a new and lasting relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom based on friendship and co-operation within the framework of a united Europe.139.	I should like to reiterate in my statement this year the interest that Spain has in the work being done by the expanded Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  which is preparing the updated law of the sea in terms of the mandate which it received from the General Assembly [resolution 2750 C (XXV)]  taking into account the interests and rights of all the States of the international community and the new realities which the last decade has witnessed.140.	My Government is pleased that at the two sessions held by that Committee this year its work has progressed satisfactorily in terms of the importance of its task.141.	Throughout its sessions the Committee on the sea-bed has confirmed the justice of the thesis which my country shares with many other countries concerning the legal regime of the territorial sea belonging to States  and specifically concerning the basic concept of innocent passage  a concept of universal interest to protect the security and the vital interests of each and every State. We are opposed to the discriminatory attempts to alter this concept to the detriment of the riparian States which border on certain straits. Any seaman can in good faith satisfy his legitimate interests by respecting the sovereign rights of the State in whose waters he is traveling. The alleged freedoms that some are now seeking are only strategic political demands which will be translated sooner or later into attempts against peace and security. They are therefore unacceptable to us.142.	The safeguarding of peace is the primary objective of this Organization. For the full realization of his destiny  man needs peace and freedom. He requires that his peace should not be threatened nor his freedom limited by insuperable obstacles. Of all these limitations  none is more unbearable than subjugation by terror.143.	When we seem to be closer than ever to seeing ourselves freed from the domination to which we have been subjected by our physical environment  when we have available to us the means which enable us to push back the frontiers of disease  sorrow and death  a scourge of violence and terror is spreading throughout the world  actions carried out by man against man which should not be legitimized as a means of attaining what may well be noble goals.144.	Everywhere we hear voices asking for an end to violence and terror. Spain  well aware of the value of peace  which we regained after decades of sterile convulsions  is ready to associate itself with others in the search for effective solutions which will do away with terrorism.145.	The hope and illusion that mankind will be saved from terror cannot blind us to such a degree that we cease to be realistic in appraising the difficulties which will confront us in finding appropriate means for achieving that goal. Areas of tension  ideological conflicts  struggles between groups and classes  persistent injustice  and the passion and intolerance they engender make it difficult to achieve the unanimous acceptance of the possible proposals for a solution. The eradication of these tensions  conflicts  struggles and injustices should be the ultimate goal of our activities. If these are not done away with  there will be no peace or freedom in the world.146.	The United Nations should take appropriate and effective measures at the international level to achieve the following objectives.147.	First  it should formulate a definition of terrorism.148.	Secondly  it should ensure that all States fill the existing gaps in their legislations to combat new forms of delinquency  not only by adjusting their domestic legislation  but also by accepting existing international conventions. Thus  when the hijacking of aircraft began  the great majority of countries realized that their penal codes did not contain a description of the crime of aerial hijacking. Even today there are many countries that still have not incorporated into their domestic legislation the agreements of Tokyo  The Hague and Montreal   and it seems to me inadmissible that we should agree to a situation in which day by day it is made more humiliating for passengers to accept some improvised security measures and which gives aircraft crews the impression- that we do not adequately value the high responsibility of their profession.149.	Thirdly  at the same time we should succeed in working out regional and sectoral agreements for the prevention and punishment of terrorism.150.	Fourthly  we should discuss a draft international convention or conventions which at the world level would contain the necessary means for putting an end to this plague which afflicts us today.151.	Terrorism is a fresh challenge to our will to act. Calmly but with firmness and urgency we must confront that challenge. Let us not convert the suffering of so many people into rhetoric or propaganda. Let us return to suffering mankind its dignity and freedom and men will again place their hopes in and turn their eyes to our Organization.152.	One of the most important developments this year in the field of international co-operation has been  beyond question  the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  which was held in Stockholm last June. It implies that there is a formal awareness on the part of the international community of a series of almost new problems in the life of mankind. We are dealing here with serious threats which affect us all equally. This latter point should be emphasized: it is not valid for each of our countries to feel that it is protected because it stands at a greater distance in time or space from this or that specific polluting agent or from this or that specific process of the degradation of nature. In a ""compact world"" such as is rapidly emerging before our eyes the reality of our immediate natural environment is already rigorously unitary and in the common endeavor to protect it  either we all act by common accord and effectively or we shall hurl ourselves in the course of a few decades into a disastrous situation.153.	The Spanish Government is fully aware of this problem. We are aware of it domestically  where a process of industrialization carried out over a brief span of time  a deep-rooted social transformation and the rapid urbanization of areas and populations that were by tradition rural are constantly creating problems of changes in ecological balances which had been unchanged for centuries and the restoration of which  within the new and more lofty demands of the population  should be provided for as far as possible. Without going into the details of the principal measures we have been taking in recent years  I shall merely say that in terms of institutions we created this year a delegated commission of the Government  made up of 14 ministers  which co-ordinates all the legislative and governmental action relating to the defense of nature and the environment  Very advanced legislation in this field is in the stage of final drafting  and we hope that it will serve immediately as a guide-line for administrative action at all levels.154.	The immediate concern of the Spanish Government is directed towards common action for the defense of the natural environment of the Mediterranean. This area is subject today to a process of continuing degradation of nature  which is of deep concern to all the riparian States. As we fully share this concern  Spain has undertaken or is participating in various regional activities to improve our knowledge of the problem and to seek practical solutions. Among other efforts  I shall only mention the convening of a congress on ecology and tourism in the western Mediterranean  which will be held in Madrid early next November  and the proposal presented by Spain to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] for the realization of a pilot project on the Mediterranean region  which is the object of intense attention at the national level and which will be carried out in collaboration with the remaining riparian countries of OECD on the Mediterranean.155.	A large Spanish delegation  which included all the affected sectors of the life of our country  was present at the third session of UNCTAD that was held in Santiago  Chile  from 13 April to 21 May of this year. I should like particularly to emphasize the wise decision taken by UNCTAD to enlarge the Trade and Development Board  and the belief that this body  since it will be more representative  will be able to cope with the vast tasks that are entrusted to it with better guarantees of success.156.	If we should like to draw up an assessment of the third session of UNCTAD  we would have to conclude that it has not lived up to all of the hopes that had been placed in it  but that none the less it has succeeded in strengthening the move of international public opinion towards co-operation in the settlement of these problems and at the same time in the adoption of a series of specific decisions which are also directed along these lines.157.	It is true that within the concept of under-development there are varying degrees and that there are pressing and urgent measures the adoption of which will admit of no delay. My country considers it wise to wish to single out the least advanced of the developing countries. We believe that the work done is praiseworthy  but we also believe that the criterion for classification followed heretofore may in some instances be considered inadequate and may leave out of this category certain Latin American countries whose needs are at least as pressing as those of some of the countries already included on the list. It is not only for reasons of brotherly ties but also because of an elementary concern for justice that we would hope that the aspirations of these countries will be taken into account.158.	As is known  Spain still has not reached a full measure of economic development. None the less  within the limits of our potential  we are making a notable effort to help countries which are less advanced than we are. This assistance is being rendered in the form of gifts  direct investment  export credits  dispatch of technicians and experts  fellowships  organization of lectures  seminars  and so on. This constant but quiet work of my country will be continued and increased  and we shall preferentially direct it towards those countries which for various reasons are specially close to our concerns."
"37",2262,"ETH",27,1972,"It gives me great pleasure that you  Mr. President  a distinguished diplomat of a friendly socialist country with which Ethiopia has the best of relations  should be at the helm of the Assembly while I am speaking today. Your election to the presidency is a fitting tribute both to your country's contribution to the work of .the United Nations and to your personal qualities as a public figure of distinction. Please accept my heartfelt felicitations.139.	I should also like to pay a tribute to Foreign Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia for his wise and able leadership of the last session of the General Assembly.140.	All of the previous Secretaries-General have left an enduring mark on world affairs. UThant will best be remembered for having built up the moral stature of the office of the Secretary-General to great heights.141.	In the 10 months he has been in office  Mr. Kurt Waldheim has justified the confidence we have shown in him by electing him to be our Secretary-General. In keeping with the tradition of his predecessors  he has worked tirelessly to lend the moral force of the United Nations and the instruments of its diplomacy to the solution of some of the problems besetting the world today. I know we all recognize that in this endeavor he needs all the support and encouragement that we can give him.142.	Once again we are engaged in an exercise of introspection. However much we may exhort each other to be candid with ourselves  I do not believe that any of us can claim today to have the remedy for our ills. The problem is in our vision; we all tend to look at the world through the colored glasses of our national history and experience; our perspectives seem to be affected by our geographical position.143.	If the general debate at the United Nations has proved anything in the past  it has been that no one has a monopoly of truth. It is therefore necessary that we should refrain from what we may believe to be righteous indignation; we should rather concentrate on explaining problems as we see them from our particular vantage-points. If we succeed in doing this dispassionately and with the minimum of recrimination  there might be some hope that we can begin to understand each other's positions a little better.144.	Our assessments of the international scene this year may differ  but we must agree that never before have developments given more cause for hope and disappointment at the same time. Some of the big Powers which only a year ago were hardly on speaking terms not only have begun to talk to each other but have also opened up the areas of trade and accommodation. Those big Powers which used to speak to each other with raised voices have lowered their voices and have begun to listen to each other  while exploring together grounds for agreement and common action.145.	The seating of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations;  the visit of the President of the United States to the People's Republic tl China and the opening of channels of communications between the two countries; the visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union and the agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States to limit strategic nuclear missiles; the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin all these are significant and positive developments.146.	In the wake of big-Power rapprochement others have followed suit. The two Germanys and the two Koreas  which for long have remained estranged from each other  have begun talks. Determined to end their long confrontation  India and Pakistan began negotiations on the morrow of hostilities.147.	Indeed  if one were to judge the improvements that have taken place in the last year in relations among the big Powers by the yardstick of post-war history  these developments could be considered important breakthroughs. Under normal circumstances  such salutary developments would have been strong enough to create a self-sustaining momentum for peace. But these are not normal times. Regrettably  for every positive development we have ob-served we can point to another which has complicated the search for solutions to conflicts.148.	It is both pertinent and timely to ask this Assembly why the recently manifested detente in the relations of the big Powers has not led to a significant lessening of tensions everywhere.149.	The continuation of the Viet-Nam conflict and the frozen situation in the Middle East have undoubtedly limited the scope of the detente. Our failure to make a dent in the last citadel of colonialism in southern Africa has also dampened the enthusiasm which would have been otherwise justified. The rising trend of violence directed against national leaders  diplomatic envoys  international passengers and innocent civilians bodes ill for a world which was just getting accustomed to conciliation instead of confrontation.150.	To the extent that one is able to draw up a balance-sheet of such complex developments  one can venture to say that certain developments on the international scene this year seem to portend better times. But whether those portents will materialize in a durable peace will depend on what all of us  and particularly the big Powers  will do to sustain those efforts on a much broader front.151.	It is not only the cumulative force of those small forward steps that will determine in the long run whether we will have a better world; even more important will be what we do to avoid the false steps  the tilings that can undo what has been painstakingly constructed over a period of several years. Active hostilities  or a situation of near hostilities in some regions  and colonialism cannot coexist for long with improvements in other parts of the world. As has so often happened in the past  those counter-currents will sooner or later win out.152.	For the first time in a long while we have something going for peace. We should not let it stop for lack of momentum. We have to give it all the push we can.153.	It is in that context that we must realize that we have more than ever the duty to resolve the hostilities in Viet-Nam  the near hostilities in the Middle East and the problem of colonialism in southern Africa and move forward in those areas of great concern to the whole of mankind: disarmament  economic development and the establishment of a mutually beneficial system of international co-operation.154.	My Government has always believed that the solution to the Viet-Nam hostilities can be achieved not through their intensification  but through the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the provision of an opportunity to the VietNamese people to determine the political and social system under which they wish to live.155.	We have similarly expressed from this rostrum what in our judgment are the requirements for a just and equitable peace in the Middle East. The present situation of a smoldering stalemate cannot be tolerated any longer  for it contains within it the fuel for sudden eruption. So often have we witnessed the vicious cycle of violence in the Middle East that we should not now fail to realize how the present situation incubates blind violence; how one hostile action invites a counteraction more deadly and destructive than the act that provoked it; how this leads to frustration and raises the level of violence to yet higher and more dangerous levels. If peace is to have any chance  this cycle must be broken and the trend reversed.156.	In this respect we continue to believe that the diplomatic process that offers the best prospect is the one initiated by the Security Council. We also believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains a balanced set of obligations which all the parties have to accept. The fulfillment by the parties concerned of all the obligations contained in resolution 242(1967) must be vigorously pursued.157.	By common consensus  the colonial situation in southern Africa has given us no reason for hope; if anything  it has been a source of growing frustration and tension.158.	The African people of Zimbabwe have overwhelmingly rejected the so-called ""proposals for a settlement"" worked out without their participation by Ian Smith and the British Government. During the days when they were being ostensibly consulted  the world witnessed spontaneous uprisings in several cities in Zimbabwe  uprisings which may be merely a portent of things to come. In the meantime the military alliance between South Africa and Southern Rhodesia has been strengthened  and apartheid has been nurtured to spread and deepen its roots in Zimbabwe.159.	Yet nothing has been done to strengthen the one action that promises results  that is  the effective implementation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. On the contrary the sanctions have not only been successfully evaded  but even whittled down.160.	The hostilities in the Territories under Portuguese domination are growing in scope and intensity. Except for information that has been provided by our discussions here and by the United Nations Secretariat  the public at large has been kept in the dark by a conspiracy of silence about the three brutal wars being waged by Portugal. In this regard  the visit of the United Nations Special Mission which visited the liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau) has done much to focus attention on one of these wars. The report of the Special Mission [A/8723/Rev. 1  chap. X  annex I] has also been very informative as to the needs of the liberation movements in Africa and the ways in which the United Nations can help them.161.	Despite the Secretary-General's efforts on behalf of the United Nations  the prospect of independence for Namibia is as remote as ever. Like many others  we have continued to hope against hope that South Africa will yet be prevailed upon to change. But I regret to say that the Secretary-General's latest report [A/8724] does not permit any such optimism. So long as South Africa does not accept United Nations responsibility for Namibia  and so long as South Africa is not ready to transfer power to the Namibians  I do not believe there can be any justifiable hope. We have thus to recognize the wide gulf that still separates South Africa from the rest of the world. We should also be careful not to let South Africa use its talks with the Secretary-General as a public relations build-up.162.	The situation in South Africa itself has in the past year been the object of world-wide attention. The oppression of Africans and Asians and of those white people who have dared to question the wisdom of apartheid has increased. At the same time the South African authorities are painstakingly creating an elaborate structure of apartheid  transplanting people from one area to another and herding them in what in the language of their reverse logic they call ""homelands"".163.	The first meetings of the Security Council to be held in Africa  in Addis Ababa  were significant in one important respect: they helped to focus world public opinion on the problems of colonialism in southern Africa and underscored the great concern of the international community with the deterioration of the situation. It also brought the United Nations closer to the people who need its assistance most.164.	The time has come for the United Nations to look at colonialism as one interconnected problem requiring con-certed international action. The colonialist regimes them-selves have for long realized how dependent their positions have become on concerting their defence against what they consider to be the dangerous onslaught of independence. In the face of that  I wonder how long we can afford to look at these colonial problems separately  and even more  still hope to win the battle against colonialism by resorting to uncoordinated actions.165.	In keeping with this objective we believe that the international community should seriously consider taking concerted action against all the colonial regimes in southern Africa in order to deny them weapons which they can use to suppress the people and in order to sever all economic and commercial ties with them. In this context we should also reject all semantic distinctions between those weapons likely to be used for defensive purposes and those likely to be used for offensive purposes  or between economic ties likely to benefit the majority of the people or those likely to benefit the minority. There are no defensive weapons per se it all depends on how they are used. Similarly  no economic ties which strengthen the oppressor can be  at the same time  of real benefit to those oppressed.166.	What is required is a little more courage. My August Sovereign  His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I  recalled this poignantly when  addressing the Special Session of the Security Council held in Africa  he said:""Throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted  the indifference of those who should have known better  the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most  that has made it possible for evil to triumph. The glorious pages of human history have been written only in those moments when men have been able to act in concert to prevent impending tragedies. By the actions you take  you can also illuminate the pages of history."" 167.	We believe that  if the international community were to show some readiness to move in this direction  if it were only to take  for example  such limited steps as restricting future investments in the economies of these territories; there might perhaps be some hope for progress. But in most of these territories exactly the opposite is happening. Investment is increasing in all the Portuguese territories. With the completion of the Cabora Bassa dam in Mozambique  more investments  as well as an influx of overseas immigrants  are expected. In Namibia  in particular  large sums of money are being spent on mineral exploration and exploitation.168.	There is no question that  if improvement in the southern African situation is to come  the major trading partners of the colonialist and racist regimes will have to reverse their priorities and be guided by their long-term economic gains  rather than by their calculations of such gains over the short-term. So long as they fail to do that they will continue to assume a particularly significant responsibility for the prolongation of this tragic situation.169.	The African Members of the United Nations have continued to address themselves to the same problems under the aegis of the OAU. They have spared no effort to assist the liberation movements to carry out vigorously their struggle against colonial and racist domination. I wish to express the hope that the United Nations as a whole will adopt some of the measures recommended by the OAU.170.	In the interdependent world of today the battle for peace will have to be waged in all regions and on all fronts. We should not slacken our efforts in prosecuting this struggle.171.	In addition to resolving actual conflicts we have to prevent others from arising. We also have to make constant efforts to promote what the Charter of the United Nations calls ""conditions"" for peace.172.	Nothing could be more urgent in this respect at this point in time than to work for disarmament  economic and social development  and the strengthening of the United Nations.173.	We cannot allow the world to go on spending over $200 billion a year on armaments and only $7 billion for economic aid-one being 30 times more than the other without inviting instability in much of the world today. Through disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  we should remove one of the principal causes of fear and suspicion. We should free resources that can be used to meet the real needs of people in the rich and poor countries alike. By helping to create an effective system of international economic co-operation designed to help the developing countries develop faster  we also should be removing a principal source of instability and of much of the unhappiness born out of unmet needs.174.	Progress in the past year in these two areas has generally been slow  but some advances have also been made.175.	The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have yielded limited but significant results. The agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States to limit strategic defensive and offensive missiles are undoubtedly important arms control measures. They will help slow down the dangerous momentum of the arms race. If followed by other arms control and disarmament measures  they may even signal the reversal of a trend. I cannot emphasize too strongly in this respect that one obvious area which calls for immediate action is the conclusion of an agreement banning the underground testing of nuclear weapons.176.	With the signing of the important Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex]  the first real disarmament agreement in the post-war years has been achieved  for this Convention not only calls for the prohibition of all such weapons  but also for their destruction. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament now has before it similar initiatives to prohibit chemical weapons. It is our considered opinion that with regard to chemical weapons a similar approach to the one used in the Convention on biological weapons should be used  that is  the prohibition should be conceived comprehensively rather than selectively  and also the destruction of all existing chemical weapons should be required. When we say this we are not unmindful of the technical and scientific difficulties involved  but we cannot believe that these difficulties are beyond human ingenuity to solve.177.	There is  of course  always the need to keep the question of disarmament uppermost in the minds of the people. We hope the proposed World Disarmament Conference will help focus international attention and concern on one of mankind's most important problems. We also hope that all of the nuclear weapon Powers will be persuaded to join the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and make the contribution which only they can make.178.	International trade and monetary reforms dominated economic discussions in the past year. More than ever the organic links between trade  development  finance and monetary reforms have been recognized. It is now clear that if progress is to be made on any of these fronts an interconnected and concerted international action will be required.179.	The third session of UNCTAD fell short of the immediate expectations of the developing countries  but its results were not altogether barren. Judged by the new ground it broke  by what it forced all of us to address ourselves to  and  finally  by the trend of thinking which it has set in motion  the session can be said to have marked some progress. Although the benefits may still be limited and other problems remain to be overcome  what has been accomplished with regard to the provision of preferential treatment by the industrialized countries for manufactured goods coming from developing countries is significant. Regrettably  it has not been possible to make similar progress on the primary commodity exports of developing countries.180.	That the problems facing the least developed among the developing countries should have merited special attention and that a special program of action should have been envisaged to help them are matters of satisfaction to my Government. Hie need to associate developing countries with the decision-making process in economic matters was also recognized adequately  and the establishment within the International Monetary Fund of the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues in connexion with monetary reforms is already one manifestation of this belated recognition. We hope that this recognition will go beyond merely associating the developing countries and will find reflection in the decisions that will eventually emerge.181.	We are now approaching the first over-all review of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Already the realization has dawned on us that we may not have succeeded in matching the International Development Strategy we have devised [resolution 2626 (XXV)] with an appropriate institutional arrangement that will enable us to carry it out. Often when we gather under the aegis of different international institutions we seem to develop a certain bias and tend to look at the development process from one limited angle or another. As we continue to address ourselves to the problems of development it is important that we pay as much attention to how best we can organize our efforts as we do to analyzing the problems themselves.182.	The concept of a global village has become more than a figure of speech; it is a reality today. It is not only that physical distances have shrunk; our problems have become common also. International co-operation in the solution of many of our problems is no longer a luxury but has become an obligation dictated by self-interest. Today no one is strong enough to go it alone; every State that contributes to such international co-operation stands to benefit from it.183.	It is in the lasting interest of States Members of the United Nations that they should now create an equitable international order  an order buttressed by a self-sustaining system of international co-operation  in which the interests of the strong and the weak will be taken equally into account. What is required in effect is to strengthen the United Nations  increase the scope of international cooperation already established under it and move forward with imagination and ingenuity to those areas which require further co-operation.184.	It is often suggested that the United Nations has become too big and too unwieldy to be used as an effective instrument for political action. It is also said that the admission of too many small States has diluted the authority of the United Nations. We cannot accept such premises for the improvement of the United Nations. If anything  there is more to be said for a greater participation of small States in international affairs. The Charter of the United Nations is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of States; it also reflects the reality of international life by conferring special powers on the permanent members of the Security Council. In the world of today all States have an equal stake in the maintenance of peace; the consequences of the disruption of peace would affect all equally. If reforms are to be made to strengthen the institutions of the United Nations these should certainly be directed towards more democratization and not towards more restrictions.185.	It seems to us particularly significant that while improving relations between themselves the big Powers recognize the need to strengthen the United Nations as an instrument for international co-operation and negotiation. Nothing would be more damaging to the international order that we hope to create than to rely on bilateral arrangements based on the outmoded concept of the balance of power. The fact that we have not been distinctly successful in completing the edifice of a system of international co-operation as envisaged in the Charter should not lead us to seek other arrangements which historically have proved to be unsuccessful. In fact  that should give us more reason to work with dedication and deliberate speed to complete the system.186.	We are entering a phase in which the need for new areas of international co-operation and new institutions is acutely felt. The immediate stability of the international community depends on the scope and speed with which we are able to establish this new order. In establishing new principles to guide the behavior of States and in creating new institutions and procedures for settling disputes before they erupt  we must continue to address ourselves with vigor and imagination to removing potential sources of conflicts.187.	The need to create an equitable system of international co-operation for the utilization of the resources of the sea and the control of environmental pollution hardly requires emphasis. In particular  we cannot for long leave unregulated the question of jurisdictional claims over the sea and the resources of the sea-bed without bringing on ourselves a host of problems. It seems to us that now is the time to move forward  before claims and counter-claims are advanced to the stage at which they can become sources of serious conflict.188. As the international community has become more interdependent  so have the means of communication. No country today can survive without air  postal  and telecommunications links. It is a matter of growing concern to the international community that some individuals and groups have sought to disrupt orderly international life. These perpetrators of violence have not hesitated to put the lives of scores of people in serious jeopardy and to destroy life when they cannot have their way.189. My Government condemns all such acts of violence directed against national leaders  diplomatic envoys  inter-national passengers and innocent civilians. All of us have such a high stake in orderly international life that we cannot fail to condemn them and take appropriate preventive action. It must be clear to all of us that if such violence continues no one is going to remain unaffected. Failure to take effective and prompt international action will breed further violence.190.	My delegation believes that the question of international terrorism should be properly defined and discussed in a correct context. We had misgivings about discussing this matter without giving it sufficient precision. We were seriously concerned that an ill-defined discussion could be used by some to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples for freedom and independence. It is common knowledge that the colonialist regimes in southern Africa very often refer to freedom fighters as terrorists. Nothing would give them more pleasure than to reintroduce confusion as to the legitimacy of the struggle of colonial peoples for freedom and independence a legitimacy which has been recognized by the United Nations. Needless to say  these misgivings persist. Nevertheless we are ready to join in all constructive discussions of the problems posed by international terrorism.191.	Finally  I should like to say that today more than ever the world needs the United Nations. Despite some of the criticisms often heard  the United Nations has been of great service to the international community. A better way to judge its usefulness would be to imagine how the world would have fared without it. What is required of us is to do our best to improve it as an instrument for international peace and co-operation."
"38",2308,"FIN",27,1972,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  on behalf of my Government and myself  our sincerest congratulations on your election to the office of the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We recognize in you the representative of a European nation that is ardently working for peace and stability on our continent. We are confident that under your leadership the General Assembly will function effectively and harmoniously.202.	We see today a profound change in international relations  one unprecedented in modern history. This change is characterized by an increased search for dialog between the great Powers in order to solve international problems.203.	Indeed encouraging is the determination of the great Powers to do their utmost to prevent conflicts or situations which would serve to increase international tensions from arising. If this process of detente will promote  as we hope and believe  general conditions in which all countries can live in peace and security without outside interference in their internal affairs  our hopes will have been well founded. We also hope that in this process the great Powers will find it possible to establish their relations on a permanent basis of mutual trust  in spite of ideological and structural differences.204.	The efforts of the major Powers have already led to meaningful results. The agreements on the limitation of strategic arms signed in Moscow by the Soviet Union and the United States on 26 May 1972 are not only a significant step towards enhancing international peace and security; they are also an expression of a growing feeling of trust and a genuine will to co-operate for a common cause. It is to be hoped that dialog rather than dispute will become the dominant feature in international politics.205.	The efforts by the major Powers to contribute to a lessening of tension should not be seen as an alternative to the functions of the United Nations as an instrument for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Rather  we would see them as an effort to overcome the lack of agreement which has so often manifested itself in the past between the major Powers and has prevented them from making full use of this Organization for the purpose for which it was originally created.206.	The effective use of the United Nations  as we have consistently emphasized  also depends on whether we can make it truly universal. An important step in that respect was taken last year  when the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China were finally restored in the Organization. We are confident that the progress under way in Europe will pave the way for the two German States to become Members of the United Nations in the near future. Similarly  the efforts by North and South Korea to normalize their relations should encourage this Organization to provide them with equal opportunity to take part in its work in the future.207.	The Secretary-General  who has with determination assumed the responsibilities of his office  has in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add-l] raised some fundamental and timely questions about the future role of the United Nations in the political process of establishing and maintaining international peace and security. Finland  as a neutral nation  has an especially vital interest in the development of a peaceful and rational world order based on a collective security system provided for by the Charter of the United Nations. Finland has consistently regarded this Organization as the only viable international instrument for strengthening international peace and security. It is therefore natural that the Finnish Government will remain fully committed to this Organization and will give its continued support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to strengthen it as an instrument for solving international disputes.208.	The positive change in the international situation has also clearly manifested itself on a regional basis. The European reconciliation was set in motion by the treaties concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany  on the one hand  and the Soviet Union and Poland  on the other. This process has been further enhanced by the entry into force in June of the four-Power agreement on Berlin  as also through the on-going negotiations between the two German States.209.	In accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter  and in a spirit of detente  Finland has been working actively for the cause of European reconciliation. We are genuinely encouraged by the positive response which our initiatives and efforts to realize a conference on European security and co-operation have met. The FinnishGovernment believes that recent international developments have contributed decisively to making the preparatory multilateral consultations in Helsinki a reality in the near future.210.	The conclusions the Finnish Government has drawn from the fundamental changes which we are presently witnessing in the European situation further encouraged us last fall to make an identical proposal to both German Governments for a comprehensive arrangement of relations between Finland and the two German States. Later  in July of this year  the Finnish Government concluded that the time had come to enter into negotiations with both those States. These measures are based on the policy Finland has consistently pursued with regard to the two Germanys. That policy is dictated by our desire as a neutral country to stay outside the dispute between the great Powers on the German question or the bilateral differences between the two Germanys deriving there from and consistently to offer equal treatment and to seek to maintain equal relations with both.211.	Our contribution towards European reconciliation has been possible  we believe  because of our position as a neutral European nation. The recognition our policy has received from all sides has strengthened in us our conviction that neutrality cannot today be viewed as a passive concept but rather calls for active participation in efforts to keep peace and to promote co-operation between nations globally as well as regionally.212.	The strengthening of international security cannot be limited to efforts to contain or extinguish existing conflicts. Global disarmament and arms control are  indeed  most essential to our efforts to preserve coming generations from the scourge of war.213.	The Finnish Government therefore considers that this Assembly should give serious attention to realizing the proposals submitted last year by the Government of the Soviet Union  and subsequently endorsed by the Assembly at last year's session for the holding of a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)]. We believe that such a conference  if well prepared under the auspices of the United Nations  will offer an additional impetus to work in this field. The world disarmament conference should  in our view  be regarded  not as an alternative avenue of approach  but as a corollary to the valuable work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. A necessary goal of the world conference would be to universalize the disarmament negotiations. The participation in such a world conference of all the permanent members of the Security Council  by the militarily significant nations and by the divided States  obviously remains indispensable for the attainment of any meaningful results.214.	The Finnish Government attaches equal importance to the early conclusion of a treaty banning the use  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. We are encouraged by the fact that progress is being made in Geneva in this regard  and we hope that an early solution can be found inter alia to the question of the verification and control of those weapons.2.15. In our opinion  the control of a treaty on chemical weapons should be based on a combination of national and international measures. The purpose of efforts to solve the main technical problems connected with such a treaty would be to promote an atmosphere of mutual trust and thus establish conditions for the emergence of a political consensus.216.	The generally favorable trends in international relations that I have touched upon have contributed to a feeling of confidence in the future. Unfortunately  the overall situation has a negative side  as well.217.	The wave of international terrorism is reaching alarming dimensions throughout the world today. If not turned back in time  it can do irreparable damage to the world community as a whole. It is at present affecting all of us  irrespective of geography  size or political influence. The Government of Finland consequently supports the initiative taken by the Secretary-General. It is imperative that urgent attention be given to this serious and complex problem.218.	In Vietnam  we have in recent months witnessed an escalation in war  destruction  and human suffering. Finland has consistently maintained that the conflict in Vietnam can be solved only through a political settlement guaranteeing the Vietnamese people the right to decide its own future without external interference. The negotiating contacts must  therefore  be fully utilized.219.	Similarly  in the case of the Middle East  it is distressing to note that the peace-keeping process has come to a complete standstill. We see today an increased danger that the trend of affairs may  in fact  reverse itself. We must  therefore  once again make a most serious appeal to the parties concerned to show restraint and make a renewed effort to find a solution based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967).220.	The United Nations peacekeeping efforts  however inconclusive  remain an indispensable element in our endeavors to help solve international disputes through this Organization. Finland has consistently emphasized the importance of reaching early agreement on guidelines for future peace-keeping operations and their financing. We therefore urge the Committee dealing with these matters to make a fresh start and present us  in the near future  with a final agreement on the first stage of its task.221.	The efforts which the Secretary-General has undertaken with regard to Namibia at the request of the Security Council might for the first time in many years justify some feeling of hope. This  however  must not  in the opinion of the Finnish Government  become an alternative to our continued pressure on South Africa; nor must the limited results of the Rhodesian sanctions lead us to abandon them. We . must  on the contrary  abide by them in accordance with our Charter obligations and make every effort to strengthen them. The active participation of the permanent members of the Security Council is of decisive importance for a solution of all the crucial problems of southern Africa.222.	In the work of our Organization in the field of economic and social development there are encouraging signs  in spite of a regrettable slowdown in the growth of the flow of resources. We have noted with satisfaction an increasing recognition of the close interdependence between economic and social development. The recognition of this interdependence is reflected in the wish to strengthen the co-ordinating rote of the Economic and Social Council. Furthermore  the third session of UNCTAD did recognize the necessity of the widest possible participation of the developing countries in negotiations and decisions affecting their immediate interests  such as those linked to the international monetary system and the future multilateral trade negotiations. The problems of the least developed countries were also given special attention. These efforts need efficient over-all co-ordination. That  in our view  can best be undertaken by the Economic and Social Council.223.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has demonstrated that a third aspect  the human environment  has been incorporated into our concept of development. The Declaration on Human Environment  adopted unanimously at the Conference leaves no doubt that the environmental consequences of development cannot be dealt with in isolation. Overall economic and social planning can be considered only within the environmental possibilities in order to put the activity of man in relation to his environment and natural resources. The universal realization of this fact must lead us to an equally universal feeling of responsibility in the management of the development process."
"39",2354,"FJI",27,1972,"Mr. President  I wish to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly.58.	In your inaugural address you stated that your country.. owes its existence  its freedom  its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people but also to tremendous sacrifices'"" [2032nd meeting  para. 55].Here I am reminded of an observation made by the Polish representative in the Security Council on 29 August 1946 in connexion with our application for admission to the United Nations. On that occasion Dr. Lange said that.. the people of Poland have always  throughout the whole history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  had a great sympathy and feeling of great and deep community with the people of Ireland"". These are sentiments which are fully reciprocated by the Irish people. Consequently my delegation is most gratified that the presidency of the Assembly should be assumed by Poland  and we are particularly happy that this high office should devolve on a personality of your experience and competence. The proceedings over the past three weeks have demonstrated that you will discharge your functions in a manner calculated to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to enhance the standing of the Organization.59.	I should like  too  to say how much my delegation welcomed the election last December of Mr. Waldheim to fill the office of Secretary-General. Naturally his long experience in the field of international affairs  both as representative of his country at the United Nations and elsewhere and as Foreign Minister  eminently fitted him to undertake the onerous duties of that office. In the intervening months we have admired the initiative and drive he has shown since assuming those functions.60.	We have in particular been gratified by the Secretary-General's determination to use the powers conferred on him by Article 99 of the Charter to call attention to serious situations and by the readiness he has shown to make himself available to help in resolving such situations. We sincerely hope that the international community will heed his advice and will take advantage of the services which he  as depositary of important responsibilities under the Charter and ideally placed to play a detached role  is so well qualified to render. My delegation much appreciates his offer to help in any way possible in connexion with the North of Ireland.61.	When I spoke in this Assembly at the twenty-sixth session [1956th meeting] I said that we in Ireland believed that political and moral power grew not out of the barrel of a gun but out of the will of people to act together so as to translate values into facts. The United Nations was established for this purpose.62.	Men of vision and goodwill felt that the old inter-national order of sovereign  independent States which had characterized the nineteenth century was no longer adequate. The social  economic and political realities of the modern world require that we achieve a saner and more balanced view of our relations with our neighbors  within national societies  and between nation and nation  and indeed a saner and more balanced relationship between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit.63.	To meet our individual and collective purposes we are constantly adapting structures and institutions or developing new ones. If the structures fail the fault may lie not in the institution itself but in the will of the national or the international community to make it work. As a structure  the United Nations  the Secretary-General reminds us in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  is ""not an independent sovereign organization but an association of sovereign Governments  and ... its failures are also their failures"". [A/8701/Add.l  p. 2.]64.	The ability of the Organization to succeed is primarily dependent on the will of its Members. I believe that  if one examines the Organization's work and achievements to date and  more importantly  its capacity to meet the needs of the contemporary international society  one must conclude that as a structure  while some adaptations and adjustments could profitably be undertaken  the United Nations remains adequate for the tasks which it has assumed. It is not the structure which is lacking. It is the will and commitment to make it work that must be continually reinforced.65.	The central political function of the United Nations  as the Secretary-General has recalled  is  in the words of the preamble to the Charter  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". We can do this by making the Organization an instrument of collective security. Although mankind has been spared the horror of a third world war  nevertheless we are all aware that the United Nations has been unable to act to end a series of bitter and long-drawn- out localized conflicts. However  its failure in this regard is not due to the weakness of the Organization itself but manifestly to the unwillingness of the parties to those conflicts to make use of the instruments of peace-making and peace-keeping which the United Nations has at its disposal.66.	This is the eighth regular session in which our agenda includes as an item ""Comprehensive review of the whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their aspects"" [item 41]. It is well known that the Irish delegation has long stressed the importance of this item  for it is obvious that situations can arise  and quite unexpectedly  in which the peace-keeping role of the international community is the most effective means of containing potentially explosive conflicts. Ireland consequently has contended that it is essential that the United Nations evolve a system  within the existing structure  by which a peace-keeping operation can be mounted at short notice and can be effectively pursued until it has achieved its purpose. We have always held that the establishment of a peace-keeping operation is primarily a matter for the Security Council  but we have contended equally that if the Council cannot take that step the residual authority of the Assembly should be capable of being invoked. Moreover  once an operation has been mounted  it is vital that its successful completion should not be jeopardized through the inadequacy of the method of financing it.67.	Many previous speakers have referred to recent encouraging and hopeful developments in international and political relations the movement towards detente and dialog between the great Powers and between nations and States which are divided or dismembered by ideology or the fortunes of war. Ireland welcomes these developments  as we welcome  too  the movement towards full universality in this Organization  which gained enormous momentum last year when the People's Republic of China took its place among us. My delegation believes that Bangladesh should be a Member of the United Nations. For dialog  detente and universality must surely serve to strengthen the structure of the United Nations and strengthen both the confidence of the peoples in the Organization and their will to make it work.68.	The difficulties confronting national and international society are frequently more acute and more complex in the economic area. The United Nations  through UNCTAD  is engaged in what the distinguished Foreign Minister of France rightly called a ""great movement of solidarity"" [2041st meeting  para. 73].69.	The problems with which UNCTAD has to deal are numerous  delicate and difficult. They directly affect the well-being and livelihood of all the peoples of the world.The relatively disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD  which took place some months ago in Chile  should not  therefore  be allowed to weaken our determination to persevere. The session should not be judged solely in the light of its immediate or concrete results. It served to define more clearly the areas in which our efforts must be concentrated and has made the international community both more aware of what needs to be done and more alive to the need to do it. It also demonstrated that  while the many problems involved are interrelated  the best hope of success lies in attacking them individually rather than in trying to solve them all simultaneously.70.	The interplay of our will to act and the structures through which we can act in the political and economic spheres is also manifest in the complex relations between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit. There has been a growing realization in recent years of the importance of achieving a saner and more balanced view of the relations between man and the human environment. Piecemeal and uncoordinated development of industry  overpopulation  urbanization and rural depopulation  we now realize  can disturb  and have disturbed  the delicate balance between man and his ecological habitat. Resources have been depleted by rapacious exploitation; other resources have been destroyed by pollution and industrial waste; and many of the great cities of our civilization have been made barbarous by the refuse of mindless consumerism and planned obsolescence.71.	The recent success of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  is therefore a heartening sign. It is evidence of a growing realization of the gravity and complexity of the problems which world industrialization and urbanization have created and of a willingness to develop through the United Nations system a means of regulating growth and achieving and maintaining a proper equilibrium between the exploitation and conservation of the earth's resources. The tasks of the United Nations in this regard and its responsibility to succeeding generations are hardly less arduous and grave than those which it has assumed in its primary purpose of saving our children from the scourge of war.72.	Twice in this century the clash of opposing national wills brought war to Europe. And the tragic lesson which war sometimes teaches and out of which the United Nations was born has a crucial relevance for Europeans. Those who had endured those terrible years had also reaped a new wisdom. The leaders of Europe realized that  if the continent was to avoid a further and perhaps final catastrophe  a profound transformation of European relations was necessary. National economic and political rivalries and dissension had to be replaced by co-operation and consensus.73.	Just as the adoption of the United Nations Charter laid the foundation of a new world structure and order  the Treaty of Rome  laid the foundations of a new regional structure and order in which the peoples of Europe would assume obligations which bound them even more closely and committed them to work out together the common destiny to which both geography and history summoned them. In the years since 1957  when the Treaty of Rome was signed  the European Economic Community has undergone a process of evolution and development-which has been sometimes painful and often difficult but which  we are confident  is now about to repay the work  the tenacity and the vision of those men who labored to translate the ideal of European economic and political unity into a reality.74.	Since I last addressed this Assembly the Irish people have expressed their overwhelming will to participate fully in the European Economic Community  which in a few months' time  with the accession of new member States  will group together some 250 million people. Ireland will bring its own heritage to this community of complementary cultures-which in Europe is endeavoring to build unity in diversity and  through co-operation and consensus  to guarantee to all our children that birthright of peace  of physical security  of material prosperity and of moral enrichment which should and can be the right of all mankind.75.	One paragraph in the speech made in this general debate by the United Kingdom Secretary of State struck me as being especially arresting. Speaking in the context of Europe about East-West relations  he said:""We must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this  but the fact is that neighborliness  once confidence is broken  cannot be recreated in a day."" [2042nd meeting  para. 107.]76.	These remarks are  I feel  cogent in another context  that of Northern Ireland  and relevant to another relationship  that of my country and Great Britain. For the relationship between Britain and Ireland could not escape the influence of events in Northern Ireland over the past three or four years. These events have tended to reduce the problem there more and more to its most basic elements. The problem derives essentially from a conflict of political wills and is aggravated by a defective political structure.77.	The conflict of wills is that between Unionism and anti-Unionism  between those who seek to perpetuate a nakedly sectarian state in Northern Ireland-while pro-testing their loyalty and allegiance to Britain and British democracy-and those who are struggling for basic civil rights and substantial recognition of the legitimacy of their allegiance to the ideal of a united Ireland.78.	Northern Ireland was created as a political entity in order to provide an area in which to cater separately for unionism in Ireland. In the demographic and political circumstances of Ireland as a whole in 1920  when Northern Ireland was established  unionism could not-and cannot today-exist on its own. A purely Unionist area could not  and cannot  be established as viable. To cater for unionism therefore required the creation of an area divided into two communities with assured dominance for one. The structure of Northern Ireland  in consequences  had political instability built into it from the beginning. As a solution for the Anglo-Irish problem it was  in the words of my Prime Minister  ""a recipe for slow disaster"".79.	A permanent peace and genuine democracy cannot be established until all the elements of the dilemma in Northern Ireland are squarely faced and dealt with together. And as I have said  the central dilemma of the North lies not only in a conflict of wills  but in the fact that this conflict of wills can never be resolved within the existing structure of Northern Ireland. A permanent solution therefore can only be found  in the view of my delegation  through a genuine attempt both to resolve the conflict of wills and to replace the existing structure.80.	To date  all the attempts by Britain and by successive Belfast administrations to bring about consensus government in Northern Ireland through reform have focused on only one element of the dilemma. In 1969 when the abuses which the divisions within the area had made virtually inevitable came to world attention Britain intervened to see to the reform of these abuses. Attempts at piecemeal reform and the violent refusal of the more reactionary Unionists to accept them brought no stability and the situation grew worse.81.	Moreover the attempts at conciliation were accompanied by efforts to coerce the minority  which simply increased their alienation  and generated tolerance or support for violent tactics  and this in turn left the two communities in the North of Ireland even further divided than before. In short  these attempts to resolve the conflict of wills failed. Six months ago  in March  in the face of persistent violence and instability  Britain took the more drastic step of suspending the structures of dominance within the area by proroguing the Northern Parliament in an effort to reassemble the shattered pieces of the structure in a more equitable and stable way. But what Britain has to face is that the very structure of Northern Ireland the unworkable attempt to create an area to deal separately with unionism in Ireland is the fundamental difficulty and that there is no way in which the pieces can be put together again so as to have permanent stability within a purely Northern Ireland setting. If a successful political structure is to be built  it must be one which is open to  and capable of  operating in a wider context  that of Ireland as a whole.82.	But the conflict of wills must also be faced. Britain and Ireland together with the divided communities in the North will have to be involved in the resolution of that conflict. The deepest concerns of the Unionist community in Ireland will have to be  and can be  met by an eventual accommodation with the national majority by negotiation and on terms acceptable to both. And the deepest concerns and desires of the Unionist community in Ireland cannot be met any other way-certainly not by coercion or by the inter-communal violence who threatens all Irishmen with common ruin.83.	It is evident that there can be no instant solution to the present difficulties. Short-term measures alone  based on a simple balance of forces within the area  will not be enough.84.	There is general acceptance at present of the need to provide a new framework for administration in the North of Ireland. This administration must provide for an equitable division of political power between the elected representatives of the communities in the area  and there must be no possibility of the abuse of security powers in the interests of one community. Beyond this  there must be recognition of  and a real political outlet for  the legitimate aspirations of the non-Unionist community.85.	Interim measures can allow a process of reconciliation to begin: membership by Britain and both parts of Ireland in the European Community will undoubtedly help. But the process of reconciliation will advance only if there is an acceptance of the need to promote and work positively towards a stable and lasting settlement on a new basis in Ireland. It is not enough simply to speak of this as a ""legitimate aspiration""  or to suggest that reconciliation  now  is a prerequisite to any progress towards this aim. If a real and lasting process of reconciliation is to begin now  there must be courageous and far-sighted policy decisions aimed at such a settlement  and there must be provision for movement towards it as the opportunities become available.86.	In brief  the aim must be not merely to hope for but to encourage actively  by every available political means  progress towards a new Ireland. It would clearly be wrong to repeat on a larger scale in the island as a whole a pattern which has already proved unstable in the North. So we must try to achieve  by agreement  new political institutions in Ireland which do not divide its communities or subordinate one to another  but which are responsive to all elements of its population and their diversity of outlook and tradition. A beginning must be made now which will promote and encourage progress in the right direction  but it would be unwise to demand absolutes  or to set a rigid time-table.87.	In speaking to the General Assembly as I have done on tills issue  which deeply troubles us in Ireland  I should like to emphasize that my Government does not consider that the interests of the national majority in Ireland are in any way at variance with the real  long-term interests of the Unionist community. Nor are the interests of the Irish people in conflict with those of the British people. We consider that a stable and lasting settlement in Ireland on the basis I have outlined is in the real interest of both  and we believe and hope that the British Government will come to see this  if indeed it has not begun to do so already.88.	Over the past year there have been exchanges of view between the British and Irish Governments on the mutual problem of Northern Ireland. The situation there and the approach to it I have outlined require deep involvement by both Governments.89.	The Irish Government  for its part  is fully prepared to play a constructive role in reaching a just and lasting settlement of this last difficult problem in Anglo-Irish relations. It will act  by every constitutional means open to it  to work towards a reasoned political settlement  because it believes such a settlement would be clearly in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland  of both the British and Irish Governments  and of all the people of both islands.90.	Sir Edward CAKOBAU (Fiji): Mr. President  it gives me much pleasure to add my delegation's congratulations to the many you have already received on your unanimous election as the President of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your wise and able guidance the work of the session will be successfully concluded.91.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay my delegation's tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  who guided the deliberations of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such great distinction.92.	May I also congratulate our new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on his appointment to his high office. His ability was already well known and his dedicated and wise leadership since assuming office is ample evidence that our trust and good judgment in appointing him have not been misplaced.93.	Fiji would particularly wish to commend the Secretary-General for the many personal initiatives he has taken on matters of international concern. I should like to reassure him of Fiji's continued co-operation and support.94.	I welcome the privilege and the honor of addressing this Assembly. I particularly welcome the opportunity of speaking to you about developments in my part of the world  an area which does not often feature in international news but where there is quiet progress along new courses. I also welcome the opportunity to comment from the South Pacific viewpoint on the events of the past year and on the work of the United Nations.95.	The past year has been unusually eventful. On the one hand we have seen the outbreak of renewed violence both between and within nations. We have seen continuing conflicts unnecessarily costing many lives. We have seen the wasteful and destructive diversion of wealth and resources to the purposes of war when  increasingly  the people of the world need their rational and constructive deployment for peaceful ends.96.	In the same year  we have  on the other hand  seen important initiatives taken towards easing the tensions which cause these conflicts. The various bilateral meetings which the leaders of the United States  the Soviet Union  the People's Republic of China and Japan have recently held have already yielded encouraging results.97.	We welcome the moves made by the opposing wings of divided nations to achieve through dialog some relaxation of the tensions which otherwise can have calamitous consequences for the peoples concerned and for the rest of the world.98.	The agreements reached between West and East Germany  and between West Germany and Poland  are pleasing developments. Another is the dialog between the two Koreas. We are pleased that this Assembly  in its ""wisdom  has respected the wish of the Korean people to be left alone to work out their own reunification. Removed from the spotlight of international attention and shielded from interference  encouraging progress has been made in their bilateral talks. We trust that by our next session even greater progress will have been reported. Indeed  we hope for an end of the mistrust and bitterness which have divided Korea and its people for more than two decades.99.	It is significant that these peaceful and constructive developments have taken place outside the aegis of this Organization  We are convinced that the United Nations pan at times best serve the cause of world peace and security by not venturing into areas where its intervention may not be helpful.100.	There are occasions  however  when the Organization must intervene  and indeed has a bounden duty to act  in the interest of international peace and security. It is a source of regret to us all that  despite some hopeful developments  the last year has given little evidence of the ability of the Security Council to discharge more effectively its primary responsibility  the maintenance of peace and security.101.	Fiji assumed its place in this Assembly in the sincere belief that all countries  large and small  have a role to play in promoting the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that  given goodwill  tolerance and understanding  all countries can  through this Organization  contribute effectively to the promotion of world peace and security. It is unfortunate that the exercise of a veto in the Security Council can so easily bring to nought the efforts of this Organization.102.	It may well be that the question of Security Council membership  both permanent and elected  and the power of veto which lies with permanent members  could benefit from a thorough reappraisal with the object of re-establishing the effectiveness and credibility of this most important organ of the United Nations. We are encouraged that during this current debate other speakers have also ex-pressed a similar view.103.	My Government is gravely concerned at the recent upsurge of terrorism and senseless violence which endangers the lives of innocent persons. There can be little justification for international terrorism. It disturbs the very fabric of international peace and good order. My Government therefore commends the initiative of the Secretary-General in bringing this matter to the attention of this Assembly for its urgent consideration [A/8791 and Add.l]. We would support any internationally agreed preventive measures designed to protect especially the lives of innocent people.104.	In the economic and social sphere  Fiji as a developing country is deeply grateful for the valuable assistance which we receive from the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Fiji is glad to receive international aid where it is given on the basis of mutual respect and equality. We do not  however  welcome aid that seeks to impose conditions incompatible with our sovereignty. I should like to emphasize that  although we seek and welcome aid  we ourselves realize that for our own development we must depend ultimately on our own resources and efforts.105.	Like most developing countries  Fiji has a development plan for the improvement of the quality of life of its people. In this  our primary aim has been to encourage and accelerate the social and economic development of the less favored sections of our community  and in particular those who live in rural areas. One of our tasks is to bring home to those who enjoy economic advantages that it is in their interests to do everything possible to encourage and accelerate the development of those who are less fortunate.106.	In a wider context  we believe that only a decisive and combined effort by both developed and developing countries will make it possible to eliminate widespread conditions of poverty and the disparity between the rich and the poor. And it is only by bridging the gap between the great prosperity of the few and the poverty of the many that we can build a firm foundation for lasting peace and international security.107.	Fiji welcomed the opportunity to participate in the third session of UNCTAD. The past year has seen increased activity on the part of developed countries in the preparation and promulgation of their general non-reciprocal preference schemes. In Santiago  however  the developed countries showed no great support for the developing nations' urgent appeals for new initiatives. This must be a matter of common concern to all  both developing and developed countries.108: One wonders about the developed countries. They pay lip-service to the need to bridge the gap between themselves and the developing countries; and yet at international conferences they do not hesitate to thwart proposals put forward by developing countries where these run counter to their vested interests. Such negative attitudes are reprehensible and in direct opposition to the ideals of the Second United Nations Development Decade.109.	The problem that all developing countries face in maintaining their export markets in developed countries is crucial. It has assumed a new sense of urgency for Fiji with the background of low prices for primary products and the changing pattern of economic relationships in the developed world. Fiji depends on sugar and copra for about 75 per cent of its visible export earnings  and half of its sugar production has been sent for many years to the United Kingdom under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21 December 1951. The coming negotiations with the European Economic Community are thus of particular concern to us. It is our hope that the highly developed countries in that Community will appreciate our problem and will not require us to make far-reaching adjustments in our economic relationships  particularly with our neighboring countries in the South Pacific  as the price of continuing access to the British market in an enlarged European Economic Community.110.	The last occasion on which I was present at the United Nations was only a few years ago  in 1966  before Fiji became independent  when my country was the subject of review by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is a particular pleasure  therefore  to be able to view the work of the Special Committee from a very different perspective  that of an independent member contributing to its counsels from its own very recent experience of evolutionary constitutional change. I should like to commend the realistic  constructive  and vigorous way in which the Special Committee is dealing with the question of the remaining colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories. Many of the remaining Territories with which the Special Committee is concerned are in our part of the world. We have been particularly satisfied with the progress made towards self-determination in the neighboring Territories of Papua New Guinea and Niue and the Tokelau Islands. It is our hope that the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  at present under the trusteeship of the United States  will also be able to resolve its difficulties in accordance with the wishes of its inhabitants.111.	Progress has been regrettably slow in the remaining African Territories with which the Special Committee is concerned. The question of Namibia is still unsolved. The important personal contact made by the Secretary-General with the Government of South Africa  and the recent appointment of the Secretary-General's representative regarding Namibia  will  we trust  open the way for the achievement of self-determination and independence by the peoples of that Territory.112.	In Rhodesia  the Pearce Commission in its report has recorded the wish of the people to reject the terms of a settlement negotiated between the British Government and the illegal Smith regime. Fiji accepts the findings of that Commission and is hopeful that a compromise  acceptable to all  may yet be achieved. In this regard  Fiji supports the call for a constitutional conference with equitable representation of all the Rhodesian people. We appeal to all the parties concerned to give the matter their most urgent attention  and warn against the danger of relaxing efforts to find a speedy solution to the problem.113.	I turn now to the Portuguese Territories. We are concerned that no significant progress has been made in their decolonization and deplore the violent measures used by the Portuguese authorities to repress the legitimate aspirations of their colonial peoples. We strongly urge the Portuguese authorities to cease all hostilities and to hasten decolonization processes in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).114.	A sphere of activity where years of preparation have begun to show results is that of the environment. Although Fiji is relatively free of the major forms of pollution which threaten the developed world  we are confronted with environmental problems arising from our lack of development and  in common with many other developing countries  we stressed at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm  and do so again now  that the special needs of developing countries should be kept clearly in view and should not be submerged in any campaign for environmental perfectionism which  however well-intentioned  the developing countries simply cannot afford.115.	A more immediate issue for an oceanic State like Fiji  which has always been dependent for sustenance on the resources of the sea  is the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. Assured control over coastal marine resources and inter-national agreement on a regime for the high seas are of crucial importance. We have been in close consultation with members of the sea-bed Committee whose interests are similar to our own. We are hopeful that we shall be able to formulate principles to define the concept of an oceanic archipelago' which will be acceptable to the international community and enable it to recognize our special position and our special needs.116.	Although progress in the sea-bed Committee has sometimes been painfully slow  there is gratifying agreement on the comprehensive list of subjects and issues relating to the law of the sea [A/8721  para. 23] and on the preparatory work required for drawing up an international regime. Fiji believes that  given the political will and a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation among its members  the Committee will make more rapid progress during its sessions in 1973. It is with this expectation that my Government favors the convening of the third conference on the law of the sea at an early date and shares the view expressed by many delegations in the sea-bed Committee that the conference should begin its first session at the end of 1973.117.	A subject closely allied to the questions of inter-national security  the environment and the law of the sea to which 1 have already referred is that of nuclear testing. Ever since Fiji has had the opportunity of making its voice heard in the international community  it has protested the carrying out of nuclear tests in the atmosphere  and particularly the atmosphere of the Pacific Ocean. It is a source of great regret that I must record that those protests  which have been echoed by many of our friends in this Assembly  and notably during this session by my colleagues from Australia and New Zealand  have gone unheeded. This year France has again exploded a number of nuclear devices on Mururoa atoll.118.	We are assured that these tests produce little radiation. They are said to be harmless. That being so  many countries in Fiji's part of the world question why France needs to conduct them at a point on the earth's surface which is as far removed as possible from the mass of its own territory and population.119.	The tests are contrary to the terms of the partial test-ban Treaty   to which the vast majority of the Members of this Organization  including Fiji  have sub-scribed. It is true that France is not a party to that Treaty and that there are other countries which also continue to test in the atmosphere. At a time when wider agreements are being sought for complete disarmament and for the cessation of all nuclear testing  the activities of countries which persist in testing nuclear devices in the atmosphere must be repugnant to the international community as a whole. We will not relax our efforts  in concert with other like-minded nations  to persuade those responsible to bring their programs of destruction to an end. In this regard we strongly support and commend an initiative jointly taken by our neighbors Australia and New Zealand to bring the question of nuclear testing before this Assembly [A/8741] with a view to banning all such activity  especially in the South Pacific.120.	The questions of race and racial and other forms of discrimination continue to be a major source of friction and confrontation. This Assembly has  by a Universal Declaration and by conventions  a distinguished record of activity in trying to overcome these evils. Still the problems remain. Still we see the institutional entrenchment of racial segregation  and some countries continue to apply discriminatory policies which are condemned by the international community. These policies give cause for particular concern because they threaten international peace and security. Such policies will inevitably yield before the rising tide of international opinion and the resentment of those who are made to suffer. Still we are faced with new examples of intolerance  deportations and other forms of persecution. In whatever form their perpetrators may attempt to present them to themselves and to the world  these policies find their roots in racial resentment and the inability of man to come to terms with the dissimilarities of man. Let us not be guilty of double standards  but be ready to condemn this evil wherever if may appear.121.	As a member of the Commonwealth of Nations which tries to uphold the ideal of non-racialism  Fiji finds racial discrimination abhorrent not only where it is practiced by whites  as in southern Africa and elsewhere  but also where it is used by others to distinguish unfavorably those of different ethnic origins. In this connexion we should like to record our appreciation of the efforts being made by the Secretary-General and others to alleviate the sufferings of the Asians expelled from Uganda  and we hope that those efforts will be successful.122.	To us in Fiji race is a fact of everyday life. We have a multiracial community  composed largely of people of Indian origin and of indigenous Fijians  but with substantial minorities of Europeans  Chinese and other Pacific islanders. But we are striving to build a non-racial community. I believe that the lessons we have learned in our own society  which have led us to a more creative attitude to the differences which exist between us  could have some value in the wider context of international relations.123.	Like my colleagues the Foreign Ministers of Australia and New Zealand  who have spoken  earlier in this debate  [2042nd and 2045th meetings  respectively]  I wish to mention the South Pacific Forum. Since Fiji's independence in 1970  there has been a growth in South Pacific regionalism. Only a little over a year ago the first meeting of the South Pacific Forum took place in New Zealand. It was a historic but still tentative and exploratory meeting of the leaders of seven countries in the South Pacific. It was called to answer the need of small newly independent island nations to reach out beyond the confines of their own shores to share the common experience of government. It also helped to meet the wish of our friends in New Zealand and Australia to establish a new  post-colonial relationship. The first meeting led to the second meeting of the Forum in Canberra in February this year.124.	From these beginnings the South Pacific Forum has gained in strength and stature. We in Fiji were proud to have had the privilege of hosting the third meeting of the Forum in Suva a few weeks ago. This meeting marked the full emergence of this new institution in the region it is designed to serve.125.	The meetings of the heads of government are friendly  frank and informal  and range over many common problems. The desire to turn ideals into practice is shown by the establishment of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation  which will promote intra-regional trade among the islands and trade between them and their neighbors in the Pacific basin  and will facilitate new forms of regional economic co-operation in such areas as shipping  tourism and manufacturing.126.	Just as we in Fiji are discovering anew the spirit of co-operation and mutual assistance in our own region  so we continue to seek it in this world Organization  to which we belong. I have pointed to what we regard as some of its shortcomings  but disappointments do not justify indifference or the tendency of some to regard the United Nations as irrelevant.127.	Since 1945  and more particularly since 1955  many new and smaller nations have emerged and gained dignity through their membership in the United Nations. The voices they raise may not individually have been strong  but collectively they have been an influence for right and good. They have spoken out for small peoples and against tyranny and oppression. They are in the vanguard against racialism and colonialism  oppression and militarism.128.	It is true that the United Nations was unable to avert the tragedies of the Koreas  Bangladesh and Viet-Nam  but it has tempered the suffering through the help of its agencies.129.	At a time when man has reached out and expired the surface of the moon and now moves on to other planets  surely it is not beyond his ability to look at the United Nations  recognize the new circumstances that have arisen since its birth and  using the goodwill it has engendered  fashion from it an instrument for world peace and service."
"40",2399,"FRA",27,1972,"The first word I should like to mention as I mount this rostrum for the fifth time is hope  a difficult virtue. I am encouraged to do so  Mr. President  by your accession to this high office  which was distinguished last year by the prestige of Mr. Adam Malik. I am thinking of the ties which have linked my country to yours for almost six centuries  ties which  if such a thing is possible  will be strengthened still further by Mr.  Gierek's forthcoming visit to France. I also have in mind the important lesson of perseverance that Poland has continually lavished on Europe and the world. But the virtue of hope has also been called to mind by the praises earned in a matter of months by our new Secretary- General-a worthy successor to the man who  for the sake of the United Nations  pushed himself to the very limit of his strength. We all knew that Kurt Waldheim excelled in every intellectual quality. Today we all know that he is no less distinguished by his strength of character. He is not a man to shun the new duties which loom in his path  and so it is to him that I would first address myself.61.	France immediately and unconditionally condemned ""the acts of terrorism and reprisals which are increasing the numbers of innocent victims""  to quote the exact terms of the communique that my friend Mr. Schmelzer  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands  read on 12 September on behalf of the Conference of the 10 European Ministers of Foreign Affairs who were meeting near Rome. My country therefore shares the anguish of the Secretary- General and endorses his initiative  which we feel sets an example in two respects: first of all  because it aims at breaking the merciless chain of indiscriminate violence  and secondly  because the man who took this initiative intends to grapple not only with the most tragic consequences but also with the deep-seated causes of the problem  as the most authoritative voice in France again requested him to do some days ago in connexion with the Palestinian problem; that ""human and therefore political problem"". I am in particular happy that the Assembly has decided to include on its agenda the examination of the problem of international terrorism as a whole and that it has entrusted this task to its Sixth Committee  which will  I am sure  approach this urgent and painful issue with all the attention and to recall the word used a few moments ago by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lebanon from this same rostrum-objectivity that it requires. Mr. Waldheim has  moreover  already proved this. No obstacle deters him when it is a question of implementing Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.62.	Why should the spokesman for an old European country feel today despite all the preoccupations he and every one of us has  that hope prevails over his distress of mind? It is because this year has seen two events which are grounds for certainty: first of all  Europe is moving ahead; secondly  such a forward movement brings us nearer our common goal  namely  closer co-operation and better understanding with all peoples. If I ask your permission to link this central idea  like a conducting wire  to certain major issues which require our reflection  it is because I am speaking on behalf of a country which  as I say again deliberately  has allies but neither has nor wants enemies.63.	So let us turn our attention to Europe  towards the whole of Europe  where we shall find grounds for reassurance.64.	It was on 3 June 1972 that the Treaties of Moscow^ and Warsaw  were ratified. It was on 3 June 1972  at the same moment  that the final protocol of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin was signed by Sir Alec Douglas-Home  Mr. Gromyko  Mr. Rogers and myself. This protocol implemented an agreement which has been supplemented by arrangements concluded by all the German authorities. The negotiations were difficult  but none of the parties imposed its point of view on the others. On the contrary  the balance achieved between the reciprocal concessions was an example worth following and could only serve to strengthen equilibrium in Europe.65.	May the same spirit inspire the negotiators who are now striving to define relations between the two German States. The success of their efforts matters all the more for this Assembly because one of their objectives is to permit these two States to present themselves together before our Organization. When the time comes-and the sooner the better-the four Powers which will continue to have special duties vis-a-vis Germany and Berlin will undoubtedly be the first to want to support these two candidates for admission to the United Nations. We have become even more aware since China has joined us that the United Nations has a universal mission.66.	One year ago [1942nd meeting] I said of the European Economic Community that it was in the process of being enlarged. On 1 January the Community will group together some 250 million Europeans. Meanwhile  owing to the success of the negotiations with countries which are members of the European Free Trade Association and are not applying for membership  a vast network of agreements will link the Community to the whole of Western Europe. In a month's time in Paris the Heads of State or Government of member countries of the Community will meet  as was said recently in the course of a Franco-Italian meeting by my colleague and friend  Mr. Medici  not so much to congratulate themselves on such a success  but rather to take stock of the responsibilities incumbent upon them  responsibilities first of all towards their own people who do not want European economic integration to lose in depth what it is gaining in breadth. On the contrary  they want to expand into new fields  beginning with those of currency and the battle against inflation 67.	With regard to the other industrialized countries  the Community should also be prepared  without ever abdicating its autonomy of decision  to encourage extensive and balanced development of trade on the basis of reciprocal advantage.68.	But the French Government feels that it is particularly essential for the enlarged Community to define vis-a-vis the developing countries and  in the first instance  vis-a-vis the former associates of the Common Market  a policy no less generous than that practiced by the six members  a policy worthy of being called European. Lastly  there can be no development restricted to Western Europe. Consequently  while Western Europe is being built  the countries which comprise it are striving to strengthen their ties or to forge new ties with the nations which inhabit the eastern part of our continent.69.	And here is the third reason for Europeans to regard 1972 as memorable despite certain inevitable disappointments: the conference on security and co-operation in Europe no longer looks like just a grand design. In two months  multilateral preparations for the conference will at last begin in Helsinki. We shall do everything possible to ensure that next year the conference itself will attain its true objective  an objective that is of interest and concern to all the countries represented here: to replace-for this is indeed the issue the confrontation of blocs with dialog between peoples.70.	It took a thousand years of harsh and turbulent history for Europe to thus arrive at the beginnings of wisdom. The memory of the horrors of two world wars which began there help Europe today better to understand the price of peace and better to uphold the chances for it. The dangers through which democracy has passed in so many European countries  and to which it often succumbed  have put Europe in a better position today to weigh the price of freedom. The grandeur  but also the shadows  of its colonial past enable Europe the better to shun many forms of imperialism. Never has Europe  in its relative equilibrium  seemed better able to defend a certain ideal  which is none other than that of the United Nations: respect for international order and for the independence of each nation  the safeguard of human rights  and the rejection of everything that divides the world into rival hegemonies.71.	Already many people are turning towards this Europe  which is rediscovering its universal mission  believing in it and expecting a great deal from it. It is time for Europe to realize this; by asserting itself  it is gradually creating its own responsibilities towards the international community. Europe must understand these new duties and not shirk them.72.	Whatever the economic  political and social problems that face the members of the international community and which are echoed here  Europe must be prepared to make its own response.73.	We felt this especially strongly at the last UNCTAD meeting in April and May in Santiago  Chile. This meeting was  on the economic level  one of the most keenly awaited events of 1972  and it was held  significantly  in one of the Latin American countries which are so dear to France and which are both strongly marked by European influence and confronted with all the difficulties of profound transformation. Can we not then say that if the Santiago meeting has had positive results it was to the extent that the developing countries found understanding and support from some European nations? But also  that if the results were disappointing it was because this great movement of solidarity is as yet only in its early stages?74.	Some progress was made at the third session of UNCTAD and it is only fair to mention this. In particular  the significance of the joint conclusions which were reached on the need for complete and whole-hearted participation by the developing countries in trade and monetary negotiations in 1973 was widely appreciated. 75.	In addition  I welcome  for example  the agreement on special measures in favor of the least developed among the developing countries.  The fact remains  however  that on two essential points primary commodities and aid the balance-sheet of UNCTAD did not meet our hopes.76.	In the first case this lack of success and the meeting could have ended in total failure had the African-sponsored draft resolution on the financing of buffer stocks not been adopted was due to the overly abstract search for new formulas on the subject of outlets and prices. Rather than lingering over this debate on theory  would it not be wiser to examine  case by case  the situation of each commodity which is of particular concern to the developing countries in order to take specific measures to remedy the inadequate revenue which these countries receive from their exports?77.	In this respect the current United Nations Cocoa Conference will put to the test our determination to arrive at a satisfactory solution. The same is true for aid. Must we really reopen discussion on the objectives decided on by common agreement? Would it not be preferable to concentrate our efforts on the means of attaining them? The real problem is whether we shall follow up our resolutions; in other words  whether our political determination matches our intentions. Underdevelopment is not of concern only to international experts; it is primarily our concern  but statesmen need to have the support of public opinion. UNCTAD  at least  has understood this. It is proposing that we have a world development information day. That resolution  will  I am sure  attract the attention of our Assembly.78.	The need to make Europe's own voice heard; the difficulty in attaining this; progress-depending on the case-towards political co-operation among our Governments since it  as one of the prerequisites of world equilibrium  works in the interest of all peoples and for peace these are the three conclusions that we are compelled to draw when we look at the strife and disruption going on in the world.79.	In the Middle East can we discern any reason to hope? I  for my part  see two reasons. The first is related to my dominant theme. We have seen emerging and then growing among members of the European Community a similarity of intentions  which has several times led to concerted action. The second shows to what extent the efforts of the European Community  when it affirms its own identity  coincide with those of the international community. The Secretary-General and his special representative do not allow themselves to be discouraged by stagnation  or by delays  or by apparently unchanging attitudes. Indeed  how could they give in to fatalism? How could we ourselves renounce our responsibilities? Has not the past year shown the futility of efforts undertaken outside the United Nations?80.	We were guided by two clear and simple ideas from 22 November 1967 until 13 December 1971  two ideas on which a peace agreement may simultaneously be based: the occupied territories must be evacuated subject to minor rectifications; and all the States concerned must undertake to conform  under United Nations guarantees  to the rules which regulate peaceful relations among sovereign States. I should like today to give a new form to the appeal which  for the fourth time  I express from this rostrum with all the moral force that continuity gives my country's policy: does any people or country of the Middle East not understand that for its independence to be definitively ensured it must be sheltered from the interplay of outside scheming or rivalries? To this fundamental question there can only be a definitive and sure answer here  not elsewhere.81.	Africa  too  needs the United Nations. Last year gave us proof of this. In southern Africa why did a sense of hope  still frail  follow a heightened sense of concern? Because the Africans themselves  gathered in the capital of Ethiopia  induced the Security Council to entrust the Secretary-General with a mission  which was to make contact. May this symbolic opportunity be seized. The stakes are far greater than the question of Namibia alone. If international ethics regains its proper place  and the spirit of the Charter along with it  we will no longer have to condemn  year after year  violations of human rights and of the principle of racial non-discrimination  stressing that they are all equally reprehensible  no matter who is the perpetrator and who the victim.82.	If international morality and the spirit of the Charter regain their proper place  we will no longer have to deplore the fact that Africa's march towards development and unity is hindered by racial antagonisms  which at times cause much bloodshed without evoking sufficient reproach or horror. This ascent towards unity must continue. France regards it with an active goodwill  which extends to associations that are usefully balanced. But no vision of the future can exempt us from the duties inherited from the past. We intend to assume those duties in two ways: as Europeans and as-Frenchmen. As Europeans  true to the spirit and letter of the two Yaounde Conventions  we regard favorably ties of association between the English- speaking African States and our Community  on the sole but essential condition that the rights gained to date by the African countries  which already have ties of association  are preserved. As Frenchmen we are resolved to continue our efforts at co-operation  even if some aspects have to be changed  on the sole condition that our partners and friends continue to want it themselves.83.	But Asia? Can it be said that the United Nations does not have a voice it can make heard there  or a specific role to play there? That idea might conceivably have been defended before China was seated here. At our last session we were awaiting its delegation with impatience. I have never better understood to what extent that haste was justified than when I had the privilege in the capital of a great people ""older than history""  in the words of General de Gaulle of greeting and listening to Chairman Mao Tsetung after long talks with the Head of the Chinese Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I had never better understood how essential it was for China to be in our midst  since we want truly to make a patient and sincere effort to establish in Asia a peaceful order based on the reconciliation and coexistence of independent peoples.84.	For that matter  we are already seeing some necessary dialogs taking place. For its part  Japan  which I have visited since our last session  is contributing to that  and we must thank it. The Koreans are now providing a good example for all of us who believe that  as we have long said  ideological differences can be overcome by peaceful means. That conviction explains why we felt a harsh anomaly in the sudden eruption of the Indian subcontinent. Today we have a twofold duty: to welcome the new State which has just been born and help it to bind up its wounds; then to encourage the warring parties of yesterday to follow to the end the path of reason and reconciliation on which there must be no turning back.85.	But  above all  will the moment never come when our Organization can put into operation a vast effort of solidarity on behalf of peoples that are victims of the war in Indochina and that are all the more dear to us because they suffer so unjustly? These people of the four States of Indochina want to live in independence in a neutral and peaceful South-East Asia. France knows  of course  from experience how difficult it is to put an end to some conflicts; but I do not hesitate to say that the opportunity to bring to Indochina a peace whose political and military terms can be equally perceived is now at hand. I cannot believe that this opportunity will again be lost. No  I cannot believe that  six years after a certain address delivered in Phnom Penh which history has already proved right-a history which would have been less painful and less bloody if the voice of General de Gaulle had been better heeded.86.	The survey I have just made leads me to a very natural conclusion: on the one hand  Europe is gradually becoming aware of itself and of the role it must play in serving world equilibrium  and thus peace; on the other hand  the more France realizes that truth  the more she believes that the mission of the United Nations is not only useful but irreplaceable.87.	Why? We must ask ourselves that question very clearly  for the world has changed to such a degree since the birth of the Organization that it would be a mistake to be satisfied with the old justifications applicable to a time gone by  which preceded the entry into this Organization of most of the States represented here. I shall give my answer immediately: the respective tasks of the European Community and of the United Nations are indeed very different. The Community is an economic power par excellence whose political goals are based on its service to a certain type of civilization. The United Nations is essentially a moral force which cannot have a secular arm because its raison d'etre is to assemble  for the purpose of maintaining or restoring peace  governments representative of all systems  all doctrines  all regimes. But both have one essential thing in common: they tend to prevent the division of the world between two decision-making centers. Understand me well: the rejection of hegemonies  far from creating distrust or hostility towards the very great Powers  is the very prerequisite for a genuine and fruitful dialog. The same President of the French Republic who in a few weeks' time hopes to receive nine Heads of Government received Mr. Leonid Brezhnev in Paris and met with Mr. Nixon in the Azores. With Mr. Brezhnev  Mr. Pompidou signed the declaration of 13 principles which makes Franco-Soviet co-operation exemplary and  as the President of the Republic has just said again  gives it capital importance. With Mr. Nixon he discussed the continuance of a friendship as old as the United States itself and ever strengthened by mutual frankness.88.	The more relations improve between two very great Powers with which we maintain ties of co-operation or alliance  the more we gain  if peace gains therefrom. But  surely  no country among us  even the least powerful  intends to give up the right to choose and to guide its destiny itself.89.	For that right to be preserved it must be kept from slipping almost from sight  as would happen if left to a natural course of events. That is why so many Mediterranean countries and I am thinking especially of Algeria  Morocco and Tunisia  which are so close to us are showing such concern to have continuous dialog with Europe  in a form still to be determined. The motives that prompt them to look towards Europe are  on the whole  the same as those which justify their attachment to the principles of the Charter.90.	Such is the spirit in which we propose to participate in the major debates here  in particular those which concern the problems of over-armament and underdevelopment which  for that matter  are connected. But I intend to conclude on the essential thing  which is also the most threatened and challenged. I am aware that I speak on behalf of a country which has certainly not been irreproachable in the course of its lengthy history but which  nearly two centuries ago  proclaimed not the rights of Frenchmen but the rights of man.91.	I mentioned a moment ago that one of the essential tasks of our Organization was to condemn racial discrimination in all its forms and to combat it by the most effective means  that is to say  means consistent with the principles of our Charter. In the same spirit  the French Government last year deposited the instruments of accession to the International Convention on the Elimination ofAll Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)  annex] and this year submitted to parliament a law  which was unanimously adopted  on the elimination of all expressions of racism.92.	France is participating actively  as members know  in the convention work of the United Nations on human rights. We have  in addition  been initiators in the work in which our Organization is currently engaged to draft an international instrument for the protection of journalists on perilous missions. We cannot be indifferent to the fate of those who  in their search for objectivity  sometimes knowingly placing their lives in danger and make an essential contribution to the knowledge of the modern world and to the emancipation of peoples. Often we feel  as I have said  the need for an appeal to public opinion  which alone can jolt people out of their apathy and hasten a solution to the most serious political crises. Is it impossible to hope that increased protection will be given to those who serve the public and serve truth? We hope that this year the Assembly will be sympathetic to our efforts.93.	At its last session the General Assembly unanimously decided  in resolution 2860 (XXVI)  that a Human Rights Day should be celebrated on 10 December 1973 to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.94.	It was in Paris that the Declaration was proclaimed on 10 December 1948  and France  true to its long tradition  intends solemnly to celebrate this anniversary.95.	Assuredly  before the immensity of the problems that face the world and the urgency of certain decisions  this celebration will have mainly symbolic value  but the world of today has more need than ever of symbols-symbols strong enough to avenge justice and to comfort brotherhood."
"41",2470,"GAB",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is particularly pleasant for me to express to you on behalf of my delegation om- warmest congratulations on your outstanding election to preside over the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your abilities and the experience that you have acquired in the course of a long career entirely devoted to the service of your country made you a natural choice to play the eminent role the General Assembly has entrusted to you. Thanks to your well-known ability and competence  we are sure you will preside over our debates wisely and effectively and thus ensure the final success of our work.2.	In a world that is more and more shaken by violence  our Organization more than ever has the imperative duty to find and propose to the community of men the ways and means that will lead to detente and peaceful coexistence. That is why  Mr. President  your role is one of vital importance  for from the results of our work will be born either hope and light or doubt  pessimism and fear. This shows that your task  although noble  is very difficult because of the complexity and gravity of the problems we have to confront. We have no doubt that you will be successful in carrying out this exceptional task with your enlightened judgment and your realism and with the assistance and full co-operation of all the Members of this Assembly.3.	My delegation is also gratified to be able to pay a sincere tribute to the outgoing President of the twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Adam Malik  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. Our last session registered important successes  thanks to the work of Mr. Malik  who showed great patience  a spirit of co-operation and effectiveness.4.	I shall only mention  among the most significant events of the twenty-sixth session  the following: the admission of new Member States  the entry of the People's Republic of China into our world Organization and the election of a new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who succeeded U Thant.5.	The Government of Gabon would like to address to our former Secretary-General  U Thant  a very special tribute for the invaluable work he did at the head of our Organization during a period of 10 years. Because of his total devotion to the cause of peace in the world  U Thant has earned the thanks of our Organization.6.	To our new Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  we would again express our hopes for full success in leading our Organization. His talent  his authority and the diplomatic ability he has constantly shown in the course of the first year of his mandate are an earnest of success for the future.7.	A few months have elapsed since the holding of two very important international meetings: the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  held at Santiago  Chile  from 11 April to 19 May 1972 and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972.8.	In Santiago the representatives of the third world once again denounced the increasing gap between the wealthy and the poor nations and again appealed to the industrialized countries to try to reverse that dangerous trend which is so perilous for the future of mankind.9.	In Stockholm the representatives of the developed countries expressed alarm at the great danger to nature and to the human species from modifications of the ecological balance caused by the frantic and uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources to satisfy ever-increasing needs.10.	On the one hand are the poor nations suffering from poverty and hunger  and on the other hand are the wealthy nations complaining about the damage caused by the excessive exploitation of natural resources.11.	As can be seen  the concerns of one group are not necessarily the same as those of the other  and the exchange of views between the wealthy and the poor nations might well be a dialog of the deaf.12.	In Santiago recently the third session of UNCTAD pronounced the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade  on which so many hopes had been based.13.	The transfer by the industrialized countries of 1 per cent of their gross national product to the development of the third world has never been achieved. Indeed  assistance for development has decreased both in volume and in real purchasing power  in view of the depreciation of the value of money. The prices of raw materials  produced basically by the developing countries  are becoming lower and lower  whereas the prices of the manufactured goods exported by the wealthy countries are attaining a record level. This system of trade relations can only benefit the industrial nations  which can become even richer by it.14.	The Second United Nations Development Decade that was solemnly proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 2626 (XXV) was supposed to follow up the first  and was expected to achieve  if not exceed  the objectives that had been set in order to intensify and improve trade relations so as to provide the third world with resources with which to confront the problems of development. But if attitudes do not change and if morality is not introduced in relations of all kinds between the wealthy and the poor countries  then the Second Decade will end as did the first in bitter and inevitable failure. Such a change of attitude and approach was not manifested in Santiago. The two camps confronted one another: the third world  with its miseries and sufferings  calling for justice and understanding; and the industrial countries  unwilling or unready to accept the idea of a more equitable distribution of the profits derived from trade. This attitude of the wealthy countries can only give rise to doubts and skepticism regarding their willingness to help the developing nations by placing greater resources at their disposal  resources of both a financial and a technological nature.15.	The fact is that the industrial countries are devoting their wealth and their energies to the arms race  which  whatever may be said  has never been so intense or feverish. The Stockholm Conference warned of the grave risks that nature and mankind are running  as the constant utilization in different regions of the world of weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons has effccis which are as pernicious and dangerous as those of atomic weapons. My Government must most vehemently denounce the use of force entailed in the arms race and the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations must devote itself  first and foremost  to putting an end to that dangerous situation and impose general and controlled disarmament on the world. But this disarmament must not only be limited to nuclear weapons. It must also cover chemical weapons  since the use of these latter must immediately be condemned and prohibited in those regions where armed conflicts are at present going on.16.	The limitation of armaments will not only permit the saving of important resources that might then be devoted to development and to the welfare of peoples  but also will make possible a true relaxation of tension in the relations between opposing blocs and ideologies. It will allow us to put out the fires of conflict and will permit the dawning of an era of peaceful coexistence in freedom and in the full exercise of the sovereign rights of individuals. It is that freedom  it is these rights  that the peoples of the third world are fighting to achieve  particularly in Africa  which still suffers from colonialism and racial discrimination.17.	In Angola  in Guinea (Bissau) and in Mozambique  Portugal  defying the decisions of the General Assembly and world public opinion  still persists in maintaining its domination over African territories  against the will of the peoples to which it refuses the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence. Surely the time has come for the Portuguese leaders to recognize the legitimacy of the people's aspirations and honestly and courageously to find the ways and means  with the leaders of the liberation movements  that will allow Guinea (Bissau)  Mozambique and Angola to enjoy their right to self-determination and accede to independence.18.	In Rhodesia  as in Namibia  the situation is no less disturbing since the dignity of the black man is being flouted. In Rhodesia the Zimbabwe people should have their voice heard and should acquire legitimate rights as citizens. As far as Namibia is concerned  once again we have to express the hope that the Government of South Africa will prove its willingness to achieve peace and show its spirit of conciliation by making concrete and constructive proposals that will lead to the full enjoyment of the right of self-determination by the people of Namibia as a whole.19.	That will to peace  that spirit of conciliation  are more necessary today than ever  in the light of the efforts being made to find equitable solutions to the conflicts that at present exist. The recent attitude adopted by North and South Korea to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the country's reunification constitutes a clear manifestation of a new spirit. Through their Red Cross organizations these two countries together  without intermediaries and without outside pressures  have decided to undertake negotiations  which we trust will lead to an equitable settlement and an honorable end to the conflict that pits one country against the other  and thus extinguish this source of tension.20.	So  in the case of the Middle East  the Secretary- General  through his Special Representative  should bring about the resumption of conversations. We believe that the best basis for discussion lies still in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). That resolution was unanimously supported in the General Assembly  and the parties concerned in the conflict publicly agreed with the recommendations contained in it. It is only the full and scrupulous implementation of that resolution that can lead to an equitable solution of the question  thus putting an end to another dangerous situation whose persistence may well lead to a general explosion.21.	While the third world is involved in a battle without quarter against development  now that mankind is aware of the need to ensure defense of its natural environment  which  if disturbed  might threaten the very survival of mankind  man should not spend his energies and capacities in futile armed struggles which are so anachronistic and obsolete. Man must once and for all outlaw the use of force as the means of solving conflicts between nations. Man must mobilize his genius and his resources to claim a decisive victory over the enemies of the modern world  those enemies that are called hunger  want  pollution  racial discrimination and injustice."
"42",2514,"GBR",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like to start by echoing the congratulations which my colleagues have extended to you on your assumption of office as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to you and to your country.99.	As this is the first time that I have addressed the Assembly since the election of the Secretary-General  I should like to take this opportunity also to salute him. He has proved in the last nine months our wisdom in electing him and he has brought to this Organization the same dedication and the same talents he gave to his own country as diplomat and Foreign Minister.100.	There is an arresting phrase in the Preamble to the United Nations Charter. It bids us all ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors"". The United Nations was born from the death and destruction of two world wars in this century in which it was proved beyond any doubt that there is no longer any gain  economic or political  to be won from aggression. Those wars started in Europe. It is not therefore surprising that we have concluded in Western Europe that there is no future for any country in trying to achieve its economic or political aims by the use of force  and we are combining to remove the past rivalries in Europe and the causes of them. It is only when that lesson  which we have painfully learned  gains universal support that we shall have fulfilled the precept of this Charter which requires us to live as good neighbors. We long ago decided that collective action was necessary to meet any potential aggressor. We organized accordingly and  although at great cost  Western Europe has enjoyed physical security. As long as there is a threat we will sustain the necessary effort.101.	But  in addition to defense  national leaders have two responsibilities which must run in harness. The first is to achieve for their people a continuing improvement in the standards of education and living and the second is to guide their country's policies so as to contribute to harmony in international society. Civilization for man can thrive only in a climate of peace.102.	At this point of history  therefore  the public experiment in partnership being conducted by the enlarged European Community is of prime importance. Western Europe  late in the day but better late than never is putting into practice for the common good a philosophy which embraces full economic and political partnership. We are doing so for two overriding reasons: to outlaw the wars which have twice brought the continent to its knees and to enhance by a customs union the prosperity of the member States. We do not intend to lose our national identities but to merge our complementary personalities for the greater good of all. These developments must be of profound significance in the context of the wider world.103.	Were the Community to confine its benefits to the compass of its own membership  it would be missing its opportunity in terms of the general health of the world community. An inbred and introvert community could indeed invite trade wars and stimulate selfishness. For the United Kingdom  a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  any form of narrow European isolation would be totally alien to our whole philosophy. But there is no question of any such thing. No one contemplates that in the European Community. The call for the policies of the good neighbor in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations finds an echo in the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome  where the purpose of the Community is stated thus: ""Desirous of contributing by means of a common commercial policy to the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade"" and ""intending to confirm the solidarity which bind Europe and overseas countries  and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations"".8 So the Community has explicitly shown that it is pursuing the same objectives as the United Nations  a fact of undeniable importance when it is realized-as perhaps it seldom is that the Community conducts 41 per cent of the trade of the world and that Europe's contribution will be of great importance in the discussions of  for example  international monetary reform.104.	In each of the last three years the total flow of resources from Britain multilateral and bilateral  private and public to developing countries to help them raise their standard of living has been over the target of 1 per cent of our gross national product. The existing members of the Community have already played a notable part in this international effort. But I believe that the European Community as a whole can make a much more effective contribution by co-ordinating the efforts of individual member States in a conscious  co-operative program for the development of the developing world. The deliberations of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTAD/ in 1972  in which we were glad to play a leading part  serve to remind us how complete is our interdependence. We must find more satisfactory solutions to the problems to which UNCTAD has drawn such graphic attention. Europe  too  can make a telling contribution to solving the accumulating problems of the twentieth century  which may be grouped under the heading ""the environment"". I am glad to announce that  subject to parliamentary approval  the United Kingdom will contribute up to £ 2 million over a five-year period to the proposed United Nations Environment Fund  depending on the response made to the $100 million target.105.	In all these ways  the enlarged European Community will pass the test of neighborliness which is set in the preamble to the United Nations Charter  in terms both of its own membership and of its future relationship with the rest of the world.106.	Can we in Western Europe extend the area of confidence and hope  a theme to which Mr. Schumann  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France  spoke yesterday [2041st meeting/ with eloquence and general acceptance? For that we shall need in Western Europe the active response of the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe when the conference on security and co-operation in Europe and negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions come to be staged.107.	We must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this  but the fact is that neighborliness  once confidence is broken  cannot be recreated in a day.108.	Progress in detente has by any standard of tolerance been painfully slow. Nevertheless  there have been modest gains. The test-ban Treaty  holds; the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have placed a limitation on anti-ballistic missiles; the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and between the Federal Republic and Poland are a contribution to stability  as the Polish Foreign Minister has himself just declared; the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin can do much for the security and well-being of the city's inhabitants. This is a notable contrast to the days when Berlin was threatened by isolation and the need for an airlift. We should mark that contrast. Negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and its East German neighbor are at last making some progress. And in this improved climate  which I think most of the speakers have marked in this debate  a European security conference may be able to identify and to exploit other areas which can be used for the common benefit both of Western Europe and of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. It will not be easy. Where social and economic systems are so different and where the gulf is so wide between the Soviet interpretation of the free life and that which is practiced in the West  it is best to try for limited objectives. But we must  if life is to be tolerable  replace the negative conception of coexistence with a fabric of trust. We willingly put our hand to that task in Western Europe and look forward to this first meeting an event in itself on a common platform of countries that are members of the Warsaw Pact Organization and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  to be joined by the European neutrals. Mutual and balanced force reductions present a daunting problem because there are so many facets  military and geographical  which go to make up what is known as the balance of power in Europe  and indeed the balance of power in the world. So far it is a fact of life that it is the military balance on which the present peace rests  and that is likely to be so for some time to come. It will be our objective in all these discussions to find new approaches to neighborliness with the East  consistent with the physical security of our respective peoples.109.	The Secretary-General  in the wise introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/'8701/ Add.l]  has rightly drawn attention to the important signs of detente among the great Powers  signs which include the developments which I have just described. But the Secretary-General equally rightly pointed out the contrast between these signs and the persistence of conflict in several key areas of the world and the failure  both of the Governments concerned and of the international community  to find acceptable solutions to the underlying causes of the confrontation.110.	Although there are signs of rapprochement in Europe and indeed in Asia  there remain historic areas of continuing hostility. The danger in these places is that deadlock will be tacitly accepted as the best for which anyone can hope. That is the last doctrine which this Assembly can accept. The Secretary-General's statements and actions since he assumed office bear witness to the fact that he has no patience with the passive acceptance of deadlock. To resolve the Middle East conflict we at the United Nations made a start by framing Security Council resolution 242 (1967). My Government continues to adhere firmly to that  resolution. It will be commonly conceded  I think  by all my colleagues who are here  that we will not arrive at any alternative framework which would command a comparable measure of consent. It is better  therefore  to stick to it. This resolution provides the essential basis of any just and durable settlement primarily because it acknowledges the essential requirements of the parties  first for withdrawal  and secondly for security.111.	My Government has consistently supported the mission of Mr. Jarring  the Secretary-General's Special Representative appointed under the resolution. I very much hope that in the months ahead no opportunity will be missed to work towards an end of the present confrontation with the long-drawn-out misery of the refugees which it entails  and also the ever-present threat of war.112.	In the last few months there has been a dramatic change. Egypt has dispensed with Soviet military support. It should be recognized that this step towards depolarization is an opportunity to resume the quest for a peaceful settlement. It may be fleeting  so it should be seized. Nor should we be deflected  from this aim by the cycle of violence and reprisal which has been given fresh impetus in recent weeks.113.	Mr. Rogers  Secretary of State of the United States  drew our attention on Monday [2038th meeting] to many instances of the world-wide problem of terrorism and violence. This is a disease to which many of us in this Assembly have fallen victim. We have our own special problem of indiscriminate terrorism in Northern Ireland. In 1971 in this Assembly I drew urgent attention to our responsibilities for the climate in which the terrorist operated his beastly practice. I said: ""Sooner or later  uncompromising confrontation leads to violence [1944th meeting  para. 86.] I also said  "". .. time works for the anarchist"". [Ibid.] I then drew the attention of this Assembly of nations to the situation which seemed certain to develop  and here you will forgive me if I quote once more: ""... anarchy superseding the law of nations and with it the inherent challenge to all governmental authority."" [Ibid.  para. 87.] This is exactly what is happening now. I continued with a quotation from my statement at the 1838th meeting: '""We must call on those who have taken up arms to lay them down ... even though they claim to be carrying them in the name of justice.' "" [Ibid.]114.	Now we are up against many situations in which terrorists are meting out destruction to the innocent in the name of some hideously distorted interpretation of justice. We have wasted time in these last two or three years. Terrorism must be stopped so that law and order in the world society will not be totally undermined-and we all know this in this Assembly.115.	The Secretary-General was right to recommend this subject for inclusion in our agenda [A/8791 and Add.l]  and I am glad that the Assembly has so included it [item 92]. This question must be vigorously pursued. We in Britain will support drastic measures to stop this rot  and we welcome the initiative of Mr. Rogers! I think we must recognize that the essence of the success of any action lies in the collective application of the remedies. It is only through the international community that effective measures can be taken to end the hideous cycle of terror and violence. That is the lesson all of us in this Assembly have to accept and to apply.116.	There are certain practical steps we can all take. First  on the question of hijacking  States which have not yet become parties to the Conventions of The Hague  and Montreal  should move with all possible speed to do so. We should also do all we can to bring into effect further measures to close every haven to the hijacker and the saboteur. The United Kingdom  at the recent meeting of the Legal Committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization  has worked actively to that end. Secondly  there are three main areas in which we should make urgent progress in dealing with the problem of international terrorism. We must agree on further obligations which States should assume in regard to the prosecution and surrender of perpetrators of terrorist acts. We should decide on further controls which could be imposed to prevent the movement of terrorists from one country to another. We should do everything possible to increase co-operation among national police and security forces by encouraging the exchange of information and by taking other measures to prevent these acts and to apprehend their perpetrators. These and other measures should be considered without delay  but I repeat that action  to be effective  must be collective. We shall make our full contribution in the discussion that has already begun at this session of the General Assembly.117.	The good-neighborliness to which we are summoned by the Preamble to our Charter applies to"" us all without exception. It is not limited by geography or race. The Ugandan Government's action in expelling Ugandan Asians and confiscating their assets  without clear and unequivocal assurances of full and prompt compensation  illustrates the degradation to which intolerance can bring its disciples. This is an outrage against standards of human decency  in the face of which this Assembly cannot remain silent. These Asians have had their homes in Uganda  some of them for generations. They are now being ejected and stripped of most of their belongings and of their savings accumulated over many years. My Government  in spite of the fact that Britain is a small  overcrowded island  had made arrangements whereby Asians from East Africa holding British passports were coming into Britain in an orderly flow over the years. As far as Uganda is concerned  this agreed program has been thrown out of the window  and the Asians have been given a time limit of 90 days in which to leave. There are now only 42 days left. President Amin has said that if the Asians have not left before that deadline he will put them into ""camps"". We do not accept that that deadline has any justification in law or in morality. The Government of Uganda is responsible for the proper treatment of those who have lived in that country for many years  and putting them into ""camps"" is contrary to all accepted standards of civilized behavior. We have an obligation to take into Britain those who are British nationals and have nowhere else to go. We will keep our word  and we will keep the law. But the law is not everything. There are human problems  rights and feelings which should have equal consideration. The Ugandan Government should be called upon to change its policy and treat these people with humanity and not with contempt. Injustice must be condemned wherever it rears its ugly head  whether it is perpetrated by Europeans or Africans or Asians or whoever. Every country in the Assembly  therefore  should use its influence to insist that this injustice should end.118.	I am making two direct and simple requests to you as members of the world community assembled here. The first is to show your good-neighborliness by sharing some of the practical problems of resettling these unhappy people. I am exceedingly grateful and pay a tribute to all those who have come forward with offers of help. The second is that you should all join in calling upon General Amin to extend his arbitrary and inhumane deadline of 90 days and to allow the Asians expelled to take their belongings with them. These are two simple  humane concepts. My delegation will today request that this question should be added to our agenda as an urgent and important item.  We ask that the Assembly debate this matter without delay and we are ready to submit a draft resolution-for this inhumanity which creates refugees is of international concern. I trust that it will be overwhelmingly accepted  because  should this Organization fail to do so  there is no one to whom any person  whatever the color of his skin  can turn for common justice. This is the basis of my appeal to all of you today.119.	In conclusion  therefore  I believe that when we speak or write we should constantly remind ourselves of those words in the Preamble to this Charter: ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors"". Our minds admit the sense of this precept  but our acts fall far short of it. We must be vigilant and careful for our fellow men and act with urgency if we are to gain that peace with justice which all our people so intensely and insistently demand."
"43",2585,"GHA",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Ghana delegation and on my own behalf I congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is an honor not only to yourself but also to your country  Poland  with which Ghana has had such friendly and useful ties for many years. Colonel Acheampong  Head of State and Chairman of the National Redemption Council  has expressly asked me to convey to you fraternal greetings of the Government and people of Ghana. He also wishes me to assure you of the support of the Government of Ghana for your efforts as President of this session of the Assembly. I am mandated to assure you  Mr. President  that the Government of Ghana will continue to support and to play its role in the affairs of this Assembly  despite its preoccupation with its difficult economic and social problems.166.	The economic development of Ghana  like that of other developing countries  is plagued by an inequitable system of international trade and by a world financial structure which seems to maintain an iniquitous status quo- the poor shall become poorer and the already prosperous  richer. It is in the face of this grim reality that we in Ghana are striving not only to survive but to create for ourselves a decent standard of living. Time was when we thought foreign aid was the answer to our economic difficulties. Experience has now taught us that the present terms under which foreign aid is given generates not prosperity and plenty  but misery and privation. We have learned that the answer to our economic difficulties is not to continue to parade the corridors of the big Powers with cap in hand  begging for alms to feed our people and to develop our country. Our economic salvation lies in our own hands  and our success can be measured only by the effort we ourselves are prepared to make. That is why  since assuming the administration of Ghana barely nine months ago  the National Redemption Council  under the inspiring leadership of Colonel Acheampong  has insisted on a total mobilization of the entire resources of the country.167.	But are the difficulties and sacrifices which a ""go-it-alone"" policy implies necessary in our world today? Are all the professions of international solidarity mere empty phrases? It is the view of my delegation that the United Nations has since its inception been too preoccupied with the containment of political problems  important though these are. The larger issue  in the view of my delegation  the far more dangerous tension arising from indefensible disparities in economic levels of well-being  has not received the attention it deserves  especially from the big Powers of the world which  given the will  have the capacity to create a world without hunger  a world without poverty  a world without disease.168.	As far back as 1944  at Dumbarton Oaks  the founding fathers of the United Nations recognized the dangers inherent in economic and social disparities  and accordingly entrenched in the Charter the need for their eventual elimination. The Charter envisages the employment of international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.169.	The United Nations has already celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. But in spite of the launching of the two development decades  the gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to grow. Indeed  international trade and national fiscal systems and institutions make such a trend inevitable. It is true that some developed countries have taken some steps to meet the targets of the Second United Nations Development Decade. A scheme of generalized preferences in favor of the imports of developing countries has been put into effect by some advanced countries. Temporary measures have also been adopted to stabilize and restructure the international monetary system. But on the basis of the evidence  it is hard to escape the conclusion that for many developed countries the solemn endorsements given to the strategies and programs of action of the two development decades were only words of exhortation  and that we in the developing world were too naive in taking public pronouncements of the rich and powerful seriously.170.	The shortcomings of the International Development Strategy are in a large measure due to a lack of generous  over-all response in terms of official development assistance to be provided by the advanced countries. An alarming decline in public and legislative support in certain significant donor countries is progressively hardening into national policy. Unwillingness to liberalize tariffs  restrictive commercial and trade practices  and failure to agree on stable commodity prices have all adversely affected the prospects for improving the terms of trade of developing countries.171.	In contrast to the attractive prices of the products of advanced countries which are progressively going through an upward adjustment  primary products  which sustain the economies of developing countries  are constantly suffering a catastrophic plunge. It should be obvious to the international community that  given the fluctuations in the prices of primary products  the prospect of the developing world earning enough to meet its foreign exchange and investment needs is very  very slim. Yet since the advanced countries continue to be dependent on primary products to feed their growing industries  it is to the mutual advantage of both parties to come to an early agreement on a system of stabilization of commodity prices on the implicit understanding that such an encouraging booster to the production of primary products will  by the same token  assure the continued success of the dependent industries in the advanced countries.172.	That is why it is a matter of considerable regret to my Government that no international cocoa agreement has yet been concluded. Cocoa provides nearly 80 per cent of Ghana's foreign-exchange earnings  and it is therefore the fervent hope of the Ghana Government that  at the United Nations Cocoa Conference currently meeting in Geneva  positive conclusions can be reached in respect of cocoa.173.	Nor has this lack of significant economic progress been much helped by the monetary and financial crises and the floating of currencies by developed countries. If anything  these have largely served to accentuate the problems of developing countries. What has so greatly affected the capacity of developing countries to accomplish the planned targets of the International Development Strategy is the growing debt burden. If Ghana's experience is any guide  the debt disability imposed on developing countries is not the sole consequence of the depletion of foreign exchange earned through their export trade. In Ghana's particular case  for instance  a number of the projects  financed by suppliers' credits  were not preceded by the usual feasibility studies  which would have assured their profitability. Commissions of inquiry and other investigations conducted in Ghana have clearly established that some of the contracts were tainted with corruption. Undue inflation in respect of the prices quoted has also come to light. Added to this were the harsh repayment terms which closed the door to reasonable resources being generated to allow amortization of the debts. No wonder that many projects have turned out to be white elephants  deficient in productive results. In the light of this  the Government of Ghana expects other countries to view with understanding and sympathy the action taken by the Ghana Government in respect of its debts.174.	These disappointments brought about in our develop-ment by a host of factors  not the least of which was the sharp business practices of some creditor countries  have only increased Ghana's resolve to be self-reliant. In adopting this policy of self-reliance  we do not imply that the door is shut for genuine foreign aid from friendly countries. Our aim is to enhance the living standards of Ghanaians and to lay the foundation of institutions which will cultivate the cultural and spiritual values of the individual in an atmosphere of peace and justice. For foreign aid to be accepted  it would have to come on the most generous terms satisfying the liberal repayment arrangements of theInternational Development Agency. Ghana is also persuaded of the advantages that would accrue from diversification of its trade links with new and growing markets. In consideration of this potential benefit  plans are under way to reactivate trade and payment arrangements with Ghana's non-traditional trading partners.175.	Notwithstanding the noble objectives of the International Development Strategy  there is a growing credibility gap between intentions and performance. Technology is accentuating the inequalities between the advanced and the developing countries. While the nations of the northern hemisphere live in affluence and unprecedented comfort  the greater number of countries are condemned to a life of abject poverty  afflicted by innumerable diseases and lacking adequate social services to make life worth living. And yet the developing countries have contributed a great deal and continue to contribute significantly to the economic well-being of the affluent. Do we have to live with this situation or is it our bounden duty as an international community to remedy it through our joint efforts?176.	It was this same concern which prompted the President of the World Bank to remark recently that the rich nations of the world possessing 25 per cent of its people but 80 per cent of its wealth should have to provide the additional assistance in the form of aid and trade which the developing nations need to meet minimum national goals. That additional assistance can be financed by diverting but a tiny percentage of the incremental income which will accrue to the developed countries during the 1970s.177.	Scientific and technological advances have made the world a global village and increased the interdependence of nation-States. The problems of a section of our closely-knit world can only be ignored by the rest at its peril. We are reminded that the astronauts who went into outer space dramatically realized the world's smallness and oneness on looking back. As Woodrow Wilson warned  ""You cannot have peace  you cannot even have your legitimate part in the business of the world  unless you are partners with the rest.""178.	We believe that the philosophy of interdependence should be reflected in an appropriate and sound foreign policy which would provide the framework for the real progress of man. This brings me to the foreign policy of Ghana. In this respect I can do no more than to quote the words of our Head of State  Colonel Acheampong  on 17 January this year. He said:""Our foreign policy will first of all be based on a vigorous and dynamic African policy. We intend to foster the closest and most cordial relations with all African brothers who are still not free and who suffer deprivations  degradation and indignity on the continent of their birth. Accordingly  we shall vigorously support the eradication of the last remnants of colonialism and racial discrimination from the African continent. Our fellow Africans  struggling for control of their own destiny under the racists of South Africa  under the rebel regime of Ian Smith  in Namibia and in Portuguese-held parts of Africa will have our unflinching support.""179.	On the OAU  Colonel Acheampong stated:""We subscribe unreservedly to the charter of the OAU  and it is our resolve to lend effective support to all efforts aimed at making it an effective body for the expression and the realization of African asp:Tations.""180.	On non-alignment  Colonel Acheampong said:""Ghana's traditional policy since we became independent has been one of non-alignment.... The Government of Ghana would pursue a truly non-aligned policy; we shall be friends with all who would like to be friends with us; Ghana will not interfere in the internal affairs of any sovereign State and we expect all States to observe the same principle in their dealings with us.""181.	On the United Nations  Colonel Acheampong stated:""The new Government of Ghana reaffirms its support for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and we intend to play our full part in the United Nations and in its various organs for the achievement of the aims and purposes of the United Nations Organization"".182.	It is in the light of our declared foreign policy that I shall proceed to make a few observations on the world political situation.183.	The world political picture  as we see it from Ghana  is far from satisfactory. Strife and conflicts continue to disturb the peace of the world: the guns of war are still booming  bombs are still falling on helpless persons in many parts of the world; and the legitimate rights of sections of the world population are still being trodden upon by men who nevertheless profess high moral principles.184.	I turn now to Viet-Nam. If Indochina still continues to hit the world headlines it is because the tragic war in Viet-Nam is still with us. The cost in terms of economic and ecological waste  not counting the toll in human lives and suffering  is a blot on this Organization  which has found itself powerless to bring an end to this human tragedy. There can be no doubt now that force cannot settle the Vietnamese problem  as the massive bombing of North Viet-Nam has amply shown. The answer lies in negotiations. The understanding which is emerging between the two Germany  and between North and South Korea  assures us that this is possible. In our view the complete withdrawal of foreign forces already initiated should allow the Vietnamese people freely to settle their differences. We therefore call for a halt to the bombing of the North  the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Viet-Nam  and the recognition of the principle of self-determination in Viet-Nam.185.	I turn now to the Middle East. Under the relative calm in the Middle East lies a potentially explosive situation in regard to which we have a joint responsibility to forestall a fresh outbreak of hostilities in an area which has known so much human suffering. In the considered view of the Ghana delegation  the key to an enduring peace in the Middle East involves the surrender of territories acquired as prizes of war in return for the recognition of the rights of all States in the area and the finding of a just solution to the Palestinian problem. The conditions embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contain the balanced objectives to which my delegation wholeheartedly subscribes.186.	With regard to southern Africa  as I have already indicated earlier in my statement  the National Redemption Council has declared as a cardinal principle of Ghana's foreign policy the total emancipation of Africa from foreign domination. The Ghana Government is concerned about the continuing existence of colonialism  neocolonialism and racial discrimination not only in Africa but also in various parts of the world. These phenomena constitute a glaring anachronism while at the same time posing a potential danger to world peace.187.	Of particular concern to my Government is the increasingly grave situation in southern Africa  whose problems pose a challenge to the aims and purposes of the United Nations. As I speak now  Portugal is waging a senseless war in Angola  Mozambique  and Guinea (Bissau) to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the indigenous populations and to prevent them from enjoying a decent existence in the land of their birth. Again  as I speak now  rebel Ian Smith is riding high on his illegal usurpation of power  and continues to exploit the African majority for the benefit of the white minority. As I speak now  Vorster's apartheid system is further consolidating itself and extending its grip to Namibia. These hardened colonialists and racists  with the connivance and support of their friends  have defied civilized world opinion and have flouted with impunity all decent human values. How long can we remain indifferent to the persistence of these ills  which not only negate all that the United Nations stands for but also constitute a veritable threat to world peace? My delegation strongly believes-and would issue a warning that if the deplorable and disgraceful situation in southern Africa does not change by peaceful means it will be changed by violence  the repercussions of which will go far beyond the borders of southern Africa.188.	It is no secret that the situation in southern Africa has persisted for so long because of the aid and comfort which certain countries  particularly in the West  have been giving to these colonialist and racist regimes. The sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the Smith regime are constantly being breached by all sorts of devious means  and in this connexion it is a matter of deep regret that some major Powers are great offenders. Portugal  poor and under-developed as it is  could not have continued with this senseless war in Africa but for the material and diplomatic support of its NATO allies. Vorster's South Africa continues to enjoy the support and massive investment of international capitalist organizations  and so grows fat on the slave labor of Africans. It has even been emboldened to attempt to extend its obnoxious policies into Namibia  which is a United Nations Trust Territory. The Government of Ghana condemns without reserve all those countries which  for selfish financial gains  lend support to these regimes. The Government of Ghana adheres to the OAU declaration rejecting dialog as a means of bringing about a change in the apartheid policies of the racist Republic of South Africa. We have taken this position because we do not believe that the conditions for such a dialog exist.189.	Since it is quite obvious that the forces of colonialism and apartheid have defied all persuasive arguments for change  is it any wonder that the African nationalists have been compelled to take up arms against these regimes?190.	The Government of Ghana will continue to support  both morally and materially  the liberation movements in Africa  and to work within the framework of the OAU for the realization of their aims. In line with our declared  support for those liberation movements  the Ghana Government has offered to host the next meeting of the OAU Committee of Liberation  scheduled for January 1973  and preparations for it are already well under way.191.	I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the appeal launched by my Government's delegation at the August 1972 Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non- Aligned Countries in Guyana for material support for the liberation movements in Africa  That appeal is now directed to all peace-loving States represented here at the United Nations which have at heart the welfare of all mankind  including the peoples of Africa. The liberation movements in Africa enjoy the official recognition of the OAU and continue to receive material assistance from it. In other words  there already exists the machinery within the OAU through which such material assistance can be channeled  and I would propose that for a start we all use that machinery.192.	Furthermore  my delegation strongly supports the proposed United Nations special fund to aid the liberation movements in Africa. Those liberation movements need all the assistance they can obtain from all peace-loving peoples  and we should contribute generously to aiding them. The liberation movements in Africa are fighting for their freedom  and victory will surely be theirs. We can all hasten that victory by contributing generously towards the success of their efforts. The time for fine words of sympathy and concern is over. This is the time for action.193.	It is a sad fact that the world's arms race is ever sky-rocketing  having now reached a record of expenditure of some $200 000 million  an all time high  of which the two super-Powers alone are responsible for over 70 per cent. In spite of the parity in nuclear second-strike force reached between the two super-Powers  which would discount  if not eliminate  any nuclear knock-out victory through a surprise attack  the dangerous and vicious circle of arms build-up continues.194.	It is admitted that in the absence of a reliable system of international security  national security will continue to assume a high priority in the consideration of all Governments. Even so  there is hardly any justification for allowing the arms race to reach such alarming proportions. The Ghana Government joins the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  in calling for a comprehensive moratorium on all nuclear testing  underground as well as in the atmosphere  as a necessary step towards general and complete disarmament [see A/8701/Add.l  p. 3J. In this regard my Government welcomes the progress made at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and hopes that the modest beginning made in reaching limited agreement will lead to further progress in all fields of disarmament. Savings made in the area of disarmament could not only be usefully employed in meeting the social and economic demands at home but could also be applied in ridding the world of much of its squalor  poverty and disease.195.	It is the view of my delegation that disarmament cannot be left at the mercy of the super-Powers and the big Powers. The Government of Ghana therefore looks forward to the proposed world disarmament conference. Disarmament is an issue of universal concern. The Government of Ghana is convinced that this very desirable conference should be open to all States. My Government would be happy to participate in such a conference and to contribute to its success.196.	I have tried to outline  as briefly as possible  the world political situation as we see it from Ghana. As I have already stated  the situation is far from satisfactory.197.	We acknowledge  however  that over the past year there has been some significant improvement in certain areas of international relations  which gives us hope for a brighter future. I would cite particularly President Nixon's visits to Peking and Moscow  and the various moves for rapprochement between the two Germany  and between Eastern and Western Europe generally. The efforts of North Korea and South Korea to normalize their relations are welcome moves in the right direction  and the Simla Agreement reached between India and Pakistan is a commendable step on the road to peace between the two countries. My delegation also notes with gratification the current talks  between the Prime Ministers of China and Japan. The Government of Ghana welcomes all those encouraging trends in the world political situation  and lends them its full support.198.	Aided by advances in science and technology  man has conquered distance  found a cure for many diseases and  on the whole  improved living standards to an extent undreamed of by his forefathers. The frantic search for an affluent society and the uninhibited use of technology have naturally had their adverse consequences. The imbalance between population  industry and natural resources is already posing a threat to human existence on this planet; the depletion of natural resources  pollution and other forms of nuisance are threatening the very foundation of human life itself.199.	Environmental neglect  with its threatening disaster  is not the exclusive concern of the more industrialized countries. It is as much a problem of the developing as of the advanced countries. Soil erosion and exhaustion  whether brought about by shifting cultivation or by deforestation; the pollution of rivers and seas caused by dumping of waste and filth; the increasing pollution of the air; insufficient sanitary facilities; unchecked soil erosion; overcrowding of the cities these and a host of other environmental issues are all matters of universal concern.200.	Ghana participated^ the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972. Together with other concerned nations we worked out a strategy to prevent the further deterioration of our natural heritage. 201. As a developing country  Ghana has its share of polluted rivers and the threat they pose both to aquatic life and to the millions of people in the villages who depend on those rivers as their source of drinking water. That was why Ghana called for a fund to provide potable water. We reiterate that call here. As my delegation emphasized at the Stockholm Conference  we shall continue to use technology and industrialization to improve the quality of human life without necessarily sacrificing the need for environmental protection. Industrialization and preservation of the environment need not be mutually exclusive  for it is the belief of my delegation that determined research into the technology of industrialization could minimize  if not eliminate entirely  the pollution which is at present incidental to industrialization.202. The Stockholm Conference appropriately had as its motto ""Only One Earth"". Our destinies are linked together. Our problems cannot be solved in isolation. Peace and prosperity are indivisible. Our protestations for peace in Viet-Nam and other parts of the world and our preoccupation with the well-being of their people will ring hollow unless they are accompanied by sincere concern for the oppressed people everywhere  including the oppressed black peoples of southern Africa and all people of African descent. Finally  the Government of Ghana reaffirms its determination to work in concert with freedom-loving people everywhere to build a world of peace  justice and freedom for all."
"44",2632,"GIN",27,1972,"Since the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly  the international political situation has been marked by new and decisive facts in relations between certain Powers.188.	Despite the easing of tension which is being brought about between what is conventionally termed the East and West  despite the contacts which have occurred between the United States and the People's Republic of China on the one hand  and between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the other hand  despite the tremendously encouraging admission on the People's Republic of China to the United Nations  the world still remains in a state of tension  with trouble spots and injustices which are arbitrarily suffered by those people who are still oppressed and subjected in the middle of the twentieth century.189.	Imperialism  in effect  although it is at bay  is not giving up so easily. Its aggressions are continuing  both in Africa and Asia  as well as in Latin America  and its constant threats are still leveled against young States.190.	I should like once again to draw the attention of our international Organization to the permanent state of war in which my country is living. From July 1961 to October 1970 we were alerting international public opinion to the fact that war is being prepared against our State. This war was prefaced by repeated violations of our air space and bombings of the villages bordering on Guinea (Bissau). The aggression of 22 November 1970 against our country has shown how right we were in thus alerting international public opinion.191.	This state of affairs is recurring even now  despite the fact that the Security Council condemned Portugal after that barbarous aggression which was perpetrated in Conakry  at Gaoual and Koundara  against the Republic of Guinea.192.	In recent months  we have witnessed repeated incursions on the part of the Portuguese pirate planes which continue to violate our air space  for the most part hurling rocket bombs on our villages  sowing death and destruction and destroying the harvest of peaceful farmers. By way of example I should like to quote some other cases to illustrate the threats which are hanging over our people  threats which might turn into genuine aggression: on 27 November 1971 at 1230 four bombers dropped eight rockets on Katila  setting fire to the village and leaving three dead and several wounded; on 9 December 1971  a reconnaissance plane flew over the villages of Lela and of Sinta for 35 minutes; on 20 January 1972 at 1555 there was a reconnaissance flight over the village of Bakilouto in the administrative region of Boke; on 20 February 1972 at 1225 a reconnaissance plane was shot down in Pakaye; the next day at 1125 in the same village one of two bombers was shot down  both of these bombers being of the same type  FIAT; on 23 February 1972 at 1045 and on 18 March 1972 at 0930 two planes  one reconnaissance plane and one transport  flew over the villages of Negare and of Bundu-Furdu; on 22 April 1972 at 1600 an unidentified plane flew over the village of Guingan; on 24 April 1972 from 1052 to 1125  the villages of Kandika-Kutan  of Sutumuru and of Missira were flown over by two bombers and on the same date at 1125 at Kaurane  two other bombers attempted in vain to attack a reservoir; on 2 May 1972 at 1200  three bombers of the FIAT type attempted to attack the village of Sutumuru; on 14 July 1972 at 1425  two FIAT bombers bombed Pakaye and set fire to the Pirada station and one plane was shot down leaving two of the enemy crew dead; on 8 August 1972 at 1435 a heavy bomber attacked the villages of Pakaye and Missira  was pursued  hit and shot down in the forest of the village of Kode-Sane between Pirada and St. Hoggu.193.	These multiple attacks against the sovereignty of the Republic of Guinea surely demonstrate that imperialism is pursuing fresh aggressive maneuvers against our people.194.	We have been informed of the fact that in Guinea (Bissau) the training of mercenaries has been started again  for the purpose of reconquering the Republic of Guinea. In a few months the world should not be surprised to learn that forces made up of countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and South Africa are attacking our people. But we give you due notice that these future mercenaries will meet their end in the Republic of Guinea.195.	Those few facts must impress each and every one of us. If colonialist Portugal is pursuing a deliberate policy of provocation  to the point of bombing African States neighbouring on Territories which it occupies illegally  and is indulging in acts of piracy and banditry in deliberate violation of international morality  it is because behind them stand powerful allies which represent  as we see it  those who are truly responsible for maintaining foreign domination in Africa.196.	It is NATO  again  which makes it possible for the apartheid regime of South Africa to survive and to consolidate It"" system of racial segregation in southern Africa in defiance of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It goes without* saying that the people of South Africa  the victim of this brutal oppression  will not be able to contain its legitimate aspiration to freedom and resign itself to living in Bantustans which are nothing more than ghettos for the black man  stripped of all his elementary.rights. Despite the considerable assistance which the NATO Powers are giving to South Africa to make it into a military Power pitted against the independent States of Africa  no Power in the world will prevent the people of South Africa from some day in the near future being the absolute masters of this area which is so rich and prosperous and which is now being arbitrarily exploited by the Boers.197.	The Government of the Republic of Guinea  its Party and its militant people urge the South African nationalists to destroy the Vorster clique by force of arms and by united revolutionary action. We have no doubt that such action will be pursued victoriously under the banner of the Pan-Africanist Congress and the African National Congress in order to restore to our militant brothers their inalienable rights.198.	South Africa  whose mandate over Namibia has been revoked by decisions taken respectively by the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations  must forthwith withdraw from this Territory.199.	The strike movements initiated by Namibian workers at the beginning of this year are incontestable proof that the South West Africa People's Organization has undertaken and is skilfully conducting the struggle for liberation throughout Namibian territory. Furthermore  pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Security Council in Addis Ababa  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  will next November make a complete report to the Security Council on his mission. Whatever happens the prospects for theindependence of this people can no longer be in question  although it is true that South Africa is desperately clinging to this Territory  over which it has already forfeited political and administrative control.200.	White minority regimes have no place in southern Africa. The failure of the Pearce Commission has demonstrated to the world the shaky foundations of the rebel regime in Salisbury. The popular and spontaneous uprising of the Zimbabwe people is undeniable proof of the fact that this people has become aware of the Anglo-Rhodesian maneuvers. The United Kingdom  which is in fact the administering Power in Rhodesia  can no longer shirk its responsibility to lead this colony to independence. The group of businessmen for whom Ian Smith is a mere spokesman will of necessity have to bow to the rule of the majority which the Zimbabwe nationalists will soon make prevail under the auspices of the OAU  which at this very moment is working for unity of action on the part of all the political parties in the struggle for Zimbabwe.201.	However  the United Kingdom will have to shoulder its responsibilities fully  by immediately convening a constitutional conference of all parties to the dispute. Prior to this they should free all political prisoners  particularly Joshua Nkomo  the Reverend Sithole and others. In this connexion the vetoes cast by the United Kingdom at Addis Ababa on 4 February 1972 and in New York on 29 September 1972 will not fail to arouse in all the peoples in Africa that love peace and justice a feeling of abhorrence and indignation against the Government of the United Kingdom. Thus  in less than a year the United Kingdom has twice demonstrated its opposition to the Zimbabwe people's exercising its right to self-determination and independence.202.	Africa  which still remains the only continent where colonialism is rife  has mobilized all its human and material resources to free its peoples. Did not the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Rabat in June  double the volume of assistance given to the African liberation movements to expedite and streamline their struggle? The persistence of colonialism has made all the States of Africa fully aware of the situation; their independence will not be fully effective until all the pockets of colonial resistance in the African continent have been destroyed. The Portuguese colonies are now inflicting on economically undeveloped Portugal military reverses which undoubtedly will lead shortly to their national independence.	203.	In Guinea (Bissau)  where two-thirds of the territory is at present liberated  the PAIGC   under the direction of Amilcar Cabral  exercises effective control in the pacified areas  where a social and political infrastructure is being developed. The acts of Portuguese terrorism are in constant retreat in the face of the military offensive of the revolutionary forces of the PAIGC. Similarly  in Mozambique  where FRELIMO  has just opened a fourth battle- front in the province of Manikesso-Fala  popular action is gaining ground. The Portuguese enemy  which is endeavoring in vain to construct the Cabora Bassa and Cunene dams  will one day or another have to withdraw from this territory because  despite the logistic support of NATO  it is impossible for Portugal  which is a small country  to sustain the armed struggle even in the colony of Guinea (Bissau) alone. In this connexion it is comforting to note the recent reconciliation in Angola between the MPLA and the FNLA.  This means that new military offensives will be a sign of the intensification of armed struggle throughout the Territory. It is therefore to be hoped that the United Nations will not delay in giving its recognition to the movements in Angola and Mozambique in the same way as it did for the PAIGC. It should here be recalled that an unprecedented role has been played by the Special Mission to Guinea (Bissau) of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. That Mission of inquiry put on record how the struggle is going and how the program for economic and social development is progressing in the areas liberated by the PAIGC.204.	The Republic of Guinea wishes to pay a tribute to the three-man Mission whose report [A/8723/Rev.l  chap. X  annex I] constitutes for the Organization an example of objectivity which Fascist Portugal will not be able to impugn despite all its misleading propaganda aimed at concealing from the world the fact that it is being routed in the Portuguese Territories. 205.	It is thus with pride that the Republic of Guinea welcomed in Conakry from 10 to 13 April 19-72 the Special Committee during the meetings it held in Africa. In the context of those meetings  the United Nations sent to Guinea (Bissau) a Mission that was able to see for itself that the only genuine authority in Guinea (Bissau)-the only legitimate and popular Government-is that of the PAIGC  and that without the massive aid which the NATO Powers render to the arch-colonialist Portuguese Government the Portuguese terrorists would have been cast into the sea years ago and would never have been able to take their banditry so far as to strike a blow against the life of the people of the Republic of Guinea. Everyone will agree that such a mission should equally be sent to Angola and Mozambique in order to confer upon the liberation movements in those Territories the recognition of the United Nations.206.	Another source of anxiety to which we must refer is the Middle East. The ""no war  no peace"" situation seems more or less to be becoming the status quo. Since 1967 the Zionist occupation forces have with impunity refused to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and have refused to withdraw from the occupied territories. It must be said that Israel would never have assumed that arrogant and contemptuous attitude towards our Organization had it not enjoyed the logistic support and complicity of certain NATO Powers. That is why my delegation would like to exhort our Organization  and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  ""to oblige Israel to withdraw behind the 1967 frontiers in order to make it possible for a lasting peace to be established in that sorely tried area.207.	In the same way  it is of paramount importance that our Organization finally find a solution to the sorry plight of the Palestinian refugees. That population  which has been a population of wanderers for about a quarter of a century  has undoubtedly been a victim of decisions taken by our Organization. It would therefore be logical for this Organization  with the guarantee of the permanent members of the Security Council  to decide to rehouse and indemnify the people that has been arbitrarily hounded from its native land.208.	Can we be astonished at the sudden deterioration of the political situation in the Middle East and the consequent ever-growing resistance of Palestinian liberation movements? It is time-nay  it is high time that our Organization seriously got down to the task of restoring peace in the Middle East. It is precisely those who were responsible for the creation of the State of Israel and for depriving the Palestinians of their lands who are responsible for the increased tension and all the troubles that have been caused by the refugees  who are at the pinnacle of despair. The recent events in Munich are an example of the desperate manifestation of the victims of imperialist arbitrariness and oppression.209.	If oppression engenders its opposite armed resistance it can better be understood what sort of struggles peoples resolutely vow to wage against all forms of domination. It matters little whether the liberation movements  the legitimacy of whose struggles have been universally recognized  are called terrorist organizations or not That term is not enough to cast anathema on those who claim the same fundamental rights and the same prerogatives to a free and independent life in the community of nations we have achieved in the course of time. In some ways terrorism necessarily becomes a weapon of nations endowed with strength those very nations which yesterday  dominated by external forces and subjugated by nazism  resorted to weapons to liberate themselves.210.	Nothing could lead us to deprive our combatant brothers of their inalienable right to accede to independence and to national sovereignty. Some might wish to regard their acts of violence as simple acts by individuals or groups of individuals pursuing no particular ideal or national objective. That is to mistake effect for cause. Quite the contrary. One must go into the historical reasons that prompted this group of individuals to take up arms  despairing of their cause. To deny that reality is tantamount to denying history. The United Nations and the peoples it represents cannot acquiesce in such double talk  because that would be to question a fundamental axiom namely  the legitimacy of a liberation struggle. In fine  it would be to allow Vorster and Ian Smith  as well as Portugal and Israel  to invoke a right that has been rejected by mankind as a whole.211.	Turning now to IndoChina  the distressing situation that prevails in that part of the world  and particularly in Viet-Nam  has pained all mankind. All peace-loving and justice-loving peoples have condemned the barbaric bombing and inhuman acts perpetrated against North Viet-Nam  and the Government of the United States must realize that American greatness can only be enhanced by the immediate cessation of those acts. The great people of the United States is aware of that  and is more and more massively demonstrating its opposition to that unsavory war.212.	The escalation in bombing has reached a new stage-the stage of large-scale genocide-whereas at the same time we observe that the peace talks are proceeding. It is rather difficult  we believe  to wish for peace when the enemy is escalating the war by systematically bombing dikes  hospitals and factories  thus putting a stop to the life of the nation. The blockade of VietNamese ports and the intensification of the conflicts in Cambodia and Laos are all reasons why the international community should be convinced that the peace proposals  as also the Paris talks  are in fact nothing but a subterfuge that can deceive no one  not even the people of the United States.213.	Furthermore  we are informed that the position of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of South Viet-Nam has been frequently reaffirmed through the seven-point proposals that the heroic and indomitable people of Cambodia  Laos and Viet-Nam have constantly presented to the Government of the United States. No one can in any way doubt the sincerity and validity of the peace conditions offered by the VietNamese patriots. Therefore  we must repeat from this rostrum that the United States must finally face up to the facts. The entire world is clamoring for the immediate and unconditional cessation of this pernicious war  which has cost so many lives not only among the VietNamese but also among the American people that have been thus involved in a war which is as good as lost.214.	Still in the Asian subcontinent  the talks recently initiated between South Korea and the Democratic Republic of Korea through the Red Cross are unprecedented in the history of a divided people. In this connexion it is edifying to note the merits of that people  which of its own volition has taken the initiative to reunite families divided for more than a quarter of a century. It will be noted that  in order to encourage that reunification effort  29 States Members of this Organization  including my own country  the Republic of Guinea  took the initiative of requesting the inclusion of a new item on the agenda of the present session [A/8752 and Add.1-10] in order to convey to the Korean people the sentiments of solidarity of our Organization  because  actually  the international community cannot pass over such an event without comment  even if it is the result of negotiations that have been conducted without external interference. But at the same time  we were also aware that certain forces  always the same ones  would object  with the express purpose of jeopardizing those talks. We deplore the fact that when the agenda of this session was being adopted the proposed item was recommended for inclusion in the provisional agenda of the twenty-eighth session [2036th meeting]. However  we feel that we should repeat to those prophets of doom that despite their opposition to discussion of the Korean question at the present session  those delegations which sought to have that item included in the agenda are firmly convinced that the Korean people will effect its reunification independent of any divisive action on the part of imperialism  which seeks to perpetuate the division of theKorean peninsula in order better to exercise its flagging domination throughout the Asian continent.215.	Turning to the problem of disarmament and the possible convening of a world disarmament conference  all countries must be associated in the various discussions. The problem of peace and other major international issues are of concern to the entire world. Peace must belong to everyone: two  three or four countries cannot take decisions on behalf of all continents; hence the problem of disarmament and  particularly  %e problem of peace are not the exclusive concern of one nation  however great or strong it may be. All these matters  which are connected with the prohibition of the proliferation of nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  are of concern to the Republic of Guinea  but we wish to discuss them together with all other countries  without having piecemeal  biased or false solutions imposed upon us.216.	The struggle against economic under-development is for our peoples another field of action in which our Governments are mobilizing all their human resources in order to tap their natural resources. However  economic disparities  which are accentuated by the constant impoverishment of our countries  give a gloomy omen for the realization of the goals of the Second United Nations Development Decade. The failure of the third session of UNCTAD is ample proof of this  despite the concerted efforts made by the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America. It will be recalled that the Group of 77 developing countries  in adopting the Charter of Algiers  and the Lima Declaration   not only defined the primary goals to be achieved by UNCTAD  but also contemplated measures to reconcile the interests of the peoples of the developing countries with those of the peoples of the industrialized countries. It will also be recalled that the present system of international trade is shot through with injustices and all sorts of tariff barriers imposed by the rich countries.217.	The fact of the matter is-and the delegation of Guinea has always emphasized this that no country can do without co-operation with others. The developed countries must be able to trade  in so far as possible  with the developing countries on a basis of equality and without discrimination. But at present there is an inequitable system of trade which has been imposed on the young States and  quite obviously  is the most universal form of imperialism.218.	Our delegation agrees that no people can do without co-operation  whatever its state of development may be. For this co-operation to be lasting it is important that it be based on equality of terms of trade and on respect for the sovereignty  the rights and the legitimate interests of those States co-operating.219.	Since the accession to independence of a great number of young States colonialism has donned the paternalistic garb of neocolonialism  using that cloak of assistance and co-operation   in order to exploit the so-called under-developed countries.220.	The truth is that every people is in quest of its happiness  and the foreign aid it receives should only be a supplement to its development. It is only through this approach that co-operation can be lasting and profitable. Genuine aid should help the recipient country to do without aid.221.	In order to make our contacts more fruitful it is high time that we considered the concepts of co-operation and mutual assistance in order to avoid any form of domination. It is also to be stressed that co-operation is not confined to trade  and for it to be equitable the cooperating parties must have absolutely identical views. It is not a question of developing countries measuring the assistance of more fortunate countries with a purely quantitative yardstick; the important thing is that what they receive be given without any political strings attached  such as the forfeiture of sovereignty  or interference in domestic affairs on the part of the donor country.222.	The developed countries demonstrated in Santiago  Chile  that they were not willing to co-operate with the developing countries on the basis of the terms proffered to them by those who wished to develop their economies.223.	We in the developing countries must therefore concert all our efforts in order to bring about concrete results; in so doing we must rely first and foremost on our efforts and organize ourselves in such a way as to ensure that the people exercise power directly and have the opportunity to unleash all its creative energies.224.	Some may assert that poor countries will never be able to develop without money. We in Guinea believe that productive labor alone creates those values which crystallize in the form of hard cash; it is the source of development and of the revolutionary reordering of our societies. Without labor  the money which might be given to us would only serve to corrupt us  make us idle and enslave us.225.	If even after the two preceding sessions  which we agreed to call stock-taking sessions  problems still preoccupy a great number of countries-particularly as regards the strengthening of the effectiveness of the role of the Unite."" Nations-it is here our common task to consider and to solve those problems. Inter alia  I would refer first to the problem of the strengthening of the actions of our Organization in the solution of problems and  above all  international conflicts; secondly  to the revision of the United Nations Charter  because  while  when the Charter was originally signed the Organization comprised only about 50 countries  today it has gathered in its 132 independent  sovereign States.226.	Hence the United Nations Charter needs to be revised in view of the requirements which are arising from the presence in the Organization of new Member States. It is new inconceivable that just a few countries should be able to impose their will on others. Not only would our delegation support any proposal likely to adapt the provisions of the United Nations Charter to the principle of the sovereign equality of nations  but also we denounce the existence and  very often  the misuse of the right of the veto. That right favors exclusively the interests of those five countries in which it is vested in their capacity as permanent members of the Security Council. Hence the use of the right of veto violates those democratic principles which should govern the work of the United Nations. We must therefore abolish that practice in order to set our Organization on a genuinely democratic path  taking into account the number of countries which have been admitted to membership.227.	Furthermore  my delegation deplores the fact that certain Powers-namely  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the German Democratic Republic-should be excluded from this international Organization  despite the fact that they meet all those conditions laid down by the Charter. Need we point out that the peoples of those countries have frequently given concrete proof of their love of peace and have made excellent contributions to the political  economic  social and cultural evolution of the world in this twentieth century.228.	By way of conclusion  I should like to say  on behalf of my Government  how proud I am that you  Mr. President  were elected to preside over this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election gives new and immense hope to all those who have struggled and continue to struggle for the ideals of peace and democratic progress. To you  as well as to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  I should like to reiterate the confidence of my people and Government."
"45",2677,"GMB",27,1972,"Permit me to offer my sincere congratulations and good wishes to the President of the Assembly and to the Vice-Presidents who have been elected to guide the activities of the twenty-seventh session of the Assembly. With their experience and reputation for wise counsel  I have no doubt that this session will prove as fruitful and beneficial as the others.157.	Permit me also to express my delegation's gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  for the efficiency and diligence he has shown in executing his functions at the past session.158.	One could  with much justification  assert that the last session was characterized by a general determination to clear the air to clear the air not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of major issues of vital interest to the developing countries. I refer to the problems arising from the structure of international trade  the law of the sea-about which we shall no doubt be hearing more this session the admission of certain countries to the United Nations  the Rhodesian question and the situation in the Middle East.159.	We have followed very closely the proceedings of the First All-African Seminar on the Human Environment  held at Addis-Ababa from 23 to 28 August 1971  as well as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June 1972  which  in our opinion  constitutes a landmark in the history of post-industrial civilization and in the continuous efforts of man not only to conquer nature through science and technology but also to place science in perspective by critically evaluating its ethical and aesthetic aspects and directing science  not toward that uncertain progress that leads to alienation  destruction and meaninglessness  but towards the service of man and his environment. By so doing science would be not  as is commonly supposed  the antithesis of nature  but the mediator between man and nature. We believe that science and technology  when properly controlled and applied  can be of immense value in the rehabilitation of man-both industrial and developing man in the integration of the alienated individual into society  and in the search for new moral and aesthetic concepts  in keeping with a rapidly changing world.160.	Naturally  we  the developing countries  were at first wary of the alarm sounded by the industrialized countries at the serious environmental problems that resulted from rapid and haphazard industrialization and urbanization  seeing it  perhaps wrongly  in terms of the rich having the leisure to tell the poor how to keep their gardens neat and trim. My Government has gradually come to the view  particularly after the Stockholm Conference  which laid down certain conditions of development  that there is much value and merit in the argument of the environmentalist movement.161.	As a developing country  it is our intention to avoid as many of the pitfalls and frustrations of development as possible. My Government has therefore taken steps  in co-operation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  to prevent pollution of our beaches by crude oil. and the dumping of oil in Gambian waters. Many of our beaches were polluted by crude oil last August  at the rate of one cubic foot per yard. We are in the process of becoming a party to international conventions relating to oil pollution damage and to the conservation of natural resources. We therefore welcome the proposed United Nations environment secretariat  and we hope that as many countries as possible will avail themselves of its services. The Gambia Government has also taken steps to seek advice from UNESCO on appropriate legislative measures for the protection and preservation of historic sites and monuments  and the machinery for the administration of these sites and monuments will soon be established. Planning and drainage problems of the urban areas have also engaged our attention  and it is envisaged that significant progress in these directions will be made in the next few years.162.	My Government  however  feels that  in view  of the possible conflict of interests between the claims of rapid agro-industrial development designed to raise the income and living standards of the population  and the equally valid claims of the people for the enjoyment of adequate social and physical facilities  the developing countries will require the financial and technical assistance of the United Nations agencies and other international bodies and the cooperation of foreign businesses and international corporations in the difficult but rewarding exercise of relating the pace of economic development to the preservation and control of the human and physical environment and reducing the mental-health and nutritional hazards connected with rapid change. We are therefore encouraged by the positive approach the Stockholm Conference has taken towards the problem of pollution and the human environment. That approach  in our view  has correctly identified the major environmental problems and outlined an integrated strategy involving population control  nutrition  education  drainage and sewerage  physical planning and natural resource management for the solution of these problems. Our only reservation  which  I believe  we share with some other countries  is that instead of creating a United Nations super-agency for the environment  we propose an environmental policy and co-ordinating unit within the United Nations Secretariat  responsible to a governing council which in turn would be responsible to the General Assembly. The specialized agencies  UNDP and the World Bank would continue the work of environmental control and the injection of environmental questions into development plans and surveys.163.	There is another type of pollution  however  which is far more dangerous and difficult to control or eliminate. This is the pollution of racism and apartheid. It is a pollution both of the mind and of the body and  more significantly  it threatens to pollute the conduct of international relations. It is a pollutant the removal of which has persistently dogged the efforts of this Assembly and all the devices known to civilized state-manship.164.	We spoke a few minutes ago of the policies and programs proposed by the international community to mediate the conflict between man and nature. The Stockholm Conference quite rightly drew the world's attention to the ravages which man's arrogance and steam-engine intellect have perpetrated on nature  with the resulting physical  aesthetic and psychological damage. Nevertheless  no damage can be greater or more dangerous than that caused by man's inhumanity to man  particularly when that inhumanity is based on economic deprivation  political oppression and a morally reprehensible and intellectually indefensible system of government. The racist minority regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury and their silent backers in the West-have  in defiance of all the appeals and resolutions of this Assembly and the Security Council  and in defiance of civilized opinion throughout the world  persistently and with mechanical monotony paraded before this Assembly the tragicomedy of civitas diaboli masquerading as civitas dei. We therefore propose that this Assembly should consider amending the Declaration of the Stockholm Conference to include world-wide economic and educational measures against racism and apartheid165.	Matters arising from concerted international action against racism bring to mind the problem of Rhodesia. Sufficient time has now elapsed for all Member States to reach their conclusions on the findings of the Pearce Commission report on the so-called Anglo-Rhodesian proposals for a settlement. Before stating my Government's attitude to this new development  I should like to join my African colleagues in congratulating Lord Pearce and his Commissioners for their objectivity and their painstaking efforts in ascertaining the views of the majority of the Rhodesian population under very difficult and trying conditions. My Government is also pleased to note the United Kingdom Government's willingness to accept the necessity of this Commission in the first place  and for the moral courage it has displayed in accepting the conclusions the inevitable conclusions of the Pearce Commission.166.	The Peace Commission report has not only underlined the unequivocal rejection of the so-called settlement proposals  but has also exposed the pretentions of the illegal Smith regime to represent the wishes of the majority in Rhodesia. The report has also made it clear that there should be no illusions about the achievement of majority rule in the near future. My Government has always held the view that the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals constituted a deliberate departure from the five principles of the United Kingdom Government. We are happy that this conviction has been vindicated by an impartial body. We are also pleased to note the United Kingdom Government's continuing commitment to sanctions as long as no reasonable prospect of an equitable settlement is in sight. While we support the United Kingdom Government's proposal for a ""time for reflection"" and for more time so that all parties to the Rhodesian conflict would  hopefully  be able to create the conditions for a modus vivendi  we are somewhat apprehensive that the political time-scale that may be envisaged by the United Kingdom Government could further contribute to the preservation of the status quo in Rhodesia. We believe that the United Kingdom Government  as the responsible Power  should take the initiative  at the earliest opportunity  in convening a meeting of the representatives of all shades of opinion in Rhodesia including the leaders of the banned African political parties to review the 1969 Constitution and to propose amendments or alternatives to that Constitution  with a view to establishing democratic political processes and a genuine multiracial society as a basis for the independence of Rhodesia.167.	Time is useful for those who believe in the peaceful and democratic resolution of conflicts. It is  however  a serious error of judgment to allow dictators and racists too much time to spread their totalitarian tentacles further. It is precisely the political dividends of time  and therefore of growing confidence abroad  that the racists of southern Africa hope to reap. For this reason  we  the African countries  through the Organization of African Unity  have called upon the United Kingdom Government to convene a constitutional conference  guarantee the free expression of political opinion in Rhodesia  and provide the granting of universal adult suffrage by secret ballot for the population of Rhodesia as a whole.168.	Having outlined our position on Rhodesia  I now move from the local politics of inequality to the international economics  and politics  of inequality. Even before its meeting in Santiago in the spring of 1972  the third session of UNCTAD  was viewed with some justified pessimism by the developing countries. If its task was  in the words of its Secretary-General  Mr. Perez Guerrero  ""to bring about a reversal of prevailing tendencies in international decision-making and to translate the awareness of the development problem the central issue of our time- into convergent policies concerning trade  aid and related areas ""  then in our view  this was not accomplished at Santiago. It could not be  particularly as certain countries chose to make it their duty to give us lessons in the efficient management of our resources  some going so far as to question the necessity of international commodity agreements. Internationally  therefore  we are still in the age of charity.169.	We do  however  share the concern expressed at UNCTAD's third session over the question of linking special drawing rights to additional development assistance. As a developing country  we are also concerned with increased freight rates and maritime transport costs  as well as with comprehensive international agreements on primary commodities. Our continued development to a large extent depends on the efforts of the international community to reach agreement on equitable solutions to these development difficulties that have engaged the attention of the UNCTAD secretariat. In this connexion  my Government also welcomes the forthright manner in which the importance of expanding trade links among the developing countries was pointed out in Santiago. We believe that the lessons learned from successive UNCTAD conferences since 1964 ought to lead to the inescapable conclusion that whatever UNCTAD may achieve  whatever breaches the developing countries may succeed in making in the protectionist wall of the rich nations  in the final analysis the problem of the economic emancipation of the developing countries is a problem only they can solve through their own united efforts and strategic economic choices. The salvation of the developing countries  we believe  cannot but be most materially assisted by the developing countries themselves and by economic methods and choices peculiarly suited to the realities of the developing world.170.	I have done no more than provide a summary of my Government's policy on various issues of the day. AS a developing country and as an African country  Gambia's major concerns are trade and development  the effective prosecution of the struggle against racism and apartheid  the equitable sharing of the resources of the sea in the light of the special needs of the developing countries  the improvement and control of the human environment without prejudice to the rapid economic development of the non-European countries  and international security. These issues will no doubt engage the attention of this Assembly  and it is my Government's hope that our deliberations here will result in collective action and in the harmonization of views and policies for the resolution of these problems in the interests of mankind and in the cause of peace."
"46",2795,"GRC",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like at the outset to extend to you  on behalf of the Greek delegation and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  which constitutes a well-deserved tribute to your personal ability as a distinguished statesman and to your country  with which Greece maintains relations of sincere friendship.141.	Permit me also  Mr. President  to express to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Malik  our deep appreciation for the competent and effective manner in which he carried out his arduous task during a difficult session which was fraught with complex problems.142.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General and to thank him for his untiring zeal in the service of world peace.143.	The year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has been marked with most important events  which are destined to affect profoundly international relations in the near future.144.	The ratification of treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Soviet Union and with Poland  the visits of the President of the United States of America to Peking and Moscow and the agreements signed on that occasion  the readjustment of the policy of the great Powers to present-world realities  President Nixon's initiative to bring the Viet-Nam war to an equitable and democratic solution in sum  the detente which is emerging on the international horizon all are events of the greatest importance.145.	Nevertheless  as is pointed out by our Secretary- General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:.. we should not be too euphoric about this development since previous post-war indications of detente failed to materialize into a durable relaxation of international tensions."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. l.]146.	Indeed  the international community has on many occasions in the past witnessed periods of euphoria only to discover a little later  to its regret  that the detente which appeared to be dawning was only a fortuitous accident if not a mere expedient. Since peace is not a simple pause in the conflicts between great Powers  the international community  and more particularly small countries  cannot feel free from threat and calmly turn to the search for a better life as long as our world can become overnight again a battleground where  on one pretext or another  the interests of the super-Powers are pitted against one another.147.	We certainly do not question the special responsibilities of the great Powers for the maintenance of international peace and security. None the less  we fully agree with the Secretary-General that the idea of maintaining peace and security in the world by means of an arrangement of great Powers is outdated  belonging rather to the political concepts of the nineteenth century. In this context  I should like to associate myself fully with the remarks made a year go by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France that""... refusing to accept any kind of hegemony is the best contribution that a country can make to the birth of a truly international community."" 148.	It is certainly true that the activity of the United Nations has not always responded to the hopes of our peoples and that the goals that we set at the outset still remain partly in the realm of aspirations. World public opinion  which expected perhaps too much from the United Nations  seems to attribute to us the role of the chorus in Greek tragedies which bewails the sad fate of mortals always at the mercy of the all-powerful Olympians.149.	But since the United Nations is merely the reflection of its membership  its successes or failures are the responsibility of all its Member States  and especially of the great Powers which have been attributed special prerogatives by the Charter.150.	We feel that despite its deficiencies and imperfections we would be exaggerating if we were to maintain that our Organization  even in its present structure  is not able to deal more adequately with the problems of these difficult times. Indeed  we think that the ineffectiveness of the United Nations is due more to a lack of political will on the part of its Members to respect and abide by the principles to which they have subscribed  rather than to any institutional structural imperfections.151.	Despite a number of encouraging signs  peace continues to be absent in certain regions of the world. Thus  the situation in the Middle East still remains a constant source of anxiety and disquiet. The likelihood of a global settlement appears very remote. Five years have already elapsed since the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)-five years of continuous tension  bloody incidents and  since August 1970  a precarious cease-fire. This protracted immobility is certainly not conducive to healing the open wounds. However  it is inconceivable that the Middle East should find itself mired indefinitely in a state of ""no war  no peace"".152. Greece  whose traditional bonds of friendship with the peoples of this region date well back in history and which wishes to see them living in peace and security  continues to believe that the resolution 242 (1967) provides an equitable basis for bringing about a peace settlement in the area  covering all the disputes which separate the parties concerned. In keeping with the spirit and the letter of this resolution  the parties to the dispute should be able to find a workable solution allowing them to lead a fruitful existence in peace and security.153.	We therefore urge the parties to the conflict  whose true interests should not be confused with their wishes  to demonstrate a spirit of compromise and realism and  taking advantage of the present climate of detente and the meritorious efforts of the Secretary-General and Mr. Jarring  to move courageously towards a lasting settlement in accordance with the dictates of peace and equity.154.	With regard to the situation in the eastern Mediterranean  I should like to make a few brief remarks concerning another problem for which a solution has yet to be found  namely  the problem of Cyprus. The renewal of talks between the two communities in an atmosphere of calm  with the participation of two constitutional experts -a Greek and a Turk- as well as with the valuable assistance of the personal representative of the Secretary-General  is an encouraging and promising development.155.	Greece  abiding as it does by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and dedicated as it is to the cause of peace and international co-operation  believes that the enlarged inter communal talks are the most expedient  if not the sole remaining  means to arrive at an acceptable solution of the constitutional difficulties that persist on the island.156.	It is now up to the two negotiators to apply themselves  in a spirit of goodwill  to the search for a system of government that would enable the inhabitants of Cyprus to live peacefully within the framework of an independent  sovereign and unitary State. Admittedly  the road ahead will not be a short one  and the obstacles to be overcome are not easy. The interested parties must therefore show a great deal of perseverance and realism in order to arrive at an equitable and workable solution 157.	On this occasion it is my pleasant duty to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General as well as to all those who have contributed to this encouraging development in Cyprus  and to express at the same time our appreciation to the countries which  in a spirit of international solidarity  permit  either in the form of military units or in the form of voluntary contributions  peace-keeping operations in Cyprus to continue.158.	Speaking of trouble spots  one cannot overlook the situation in IndoChina  in Viet-Nam  which  although it does not appear on the agenda of the General Assembly  is nevertheless a subject of our concern. The continuing suffering and loss of human life cannot but trouble the conscience of all peace-loving people. We must nevertheless in all good faith recognize that the United States of America has on many occasions taken concrete measures for military disengagement and has submitted proposals such as to assure the VietNamese people of the exercise of their right to self-determination without outside interference. It would not  therefore  be unreasonable  we feel  to expect that Hanoi would take similar measures  instead of making sterile and baseless accusations against the party that has scrupulously respected its announced calendar  thus prolonging the suffering of the Vietnamese people.159.	In passing from Asia to southern Africa  I should like once again to declare that Greece  which since the creation of the United Nations has been in the vanguard of those who have resolutely and unfailingly fought for the recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination and for the elimination of racial discrimination  remains ready to help in seeking a just and realistic solution of these problems in conformity with the principles and ideals that we uphold.160.	In speaking of the international order  my delegation wishes to stress that in view of the alarming resurgence of acts of terrorism  it is necessary scrupulously to implement the relevant provisions of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  unanimously adopted by the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2625 (XXV)]  and more particularly the provisions setting out the duties incumbent upon all States in cases of international terrorism.161.	At the same time  it would be useful to undertake  as has been suggested by our Secretary-General  a thorough analysis of this problem in order to provide the necessary remedy.162.	In this respect  I wish to reiterate that my delegation unreservedly supports the provisions of the said Declaration and would stress the importance that we attach to its full implementation by all nations of the world 163.	As the question of the strengthening of international security is again on the agenda of this session  I should like to take this opportunity to state that Greece  a peace-loving country which has on many occasions been the victim of acts of aggression  is prepared  as in the past  to contribute in an active and positive manner  to all sincere efforts aimed at effectively strengthening international security.164.	At the same time Greece declares itself ready to participate in the conference on security and co-operation in Europe  as soon as the preliminary talks  in which it is taking an active part  have been concluded.165.	On the other hand  firmly attached as it is to the principles of Article 2 of the Charter  the Greek Government has for some years now been sincerely endeavoring to improve its relations with countries of different political  economic and social systems  and more particularly with neighboring States. It should also be pointed out in this connexion that Greece has recently established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.166.	We are gratified over the improvement of the political climate in the Balkan peninsula  and we should like to reaffirm our intention to pursue this policy further on the basis of strict reciprocity. We feel that there are ample opportunities for effective co-operation among the Balkan States in order to serve their common interests.167.	My delegation cannot conceal its disappointment  probably shared by the great majority of Member States  in noting that our Organization has still not been able to establish machinery to fulfill its fundamental task  namely  peace-keeping. No one can deny in the light of past experience  the usefulness and value of peace-keeping operations.168.	We feel that the time has come to abandon improvisation of such operations and to proceed to the formulation of a general agreement covering all aspects of the problem so that the United Nations may become an effective instrument for world peace 169.	Having always been actively interested in peacekeeping operations undertaken by our Organization  especially in the case of peace-keeping operations in Cyprus  towards whose success Greece has contributed substantially both materially and morally  we are prepared to work together with the other Member States to set up machinery which would enable our Organization properly to fulfill this fundamental task entrusted to it.170.	Since peace is irreconcilable with poverty and ignorance  we can hardly overemphasize the duty incumbent upon us all to take all possible steps to contribute effectively to the economic and technological progress of the developing countries.171.	Technical progress  which provides tremendous possibilities for accelerating economic development  has only widened the gap between industrially developed countries and the less privileged ones. If we wish to avoid a world split into two antagonistic camps  the rich countries and the poor ones  the north and the south  we must show constructive solidarity and undertake challenging initiatives. Peace cannot be assured as long as the majority of mankind lives in despair and want.172.	Europe in particular must understand that it will win the friendship of the peoples of the south hemisphere only to the extent that it shares with them the concern for their economic  social and humanitarian future."
"47",2883,"GTM",27,1972,"On behalf of my Government  and on my own behalf  I wish to express to you  Mr. President  our sincere and cordial congratulations on your election. Under your distinguished guidance our task of fulfilling the purposes and principles of the United Nations promises this year to be most fruitful.2.	Guatemala is attending this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly moved as always by a desire to take part in the work of this lofty world Organization and with a faith that has been confirmed in the noble principles which uphold it. We are fully convinced that  despite the great difficulties encountered since its birth  the United Nations has increasingly asserted itself in the maintenance of peace  the preservation of future generations from the scourge of war  and the protection of all mankind in the social  economic and human rights fields.3.	No one can be unaware that in the first area  notwithstanding the persistence of the Viet-Nam conflict and the delicate situation in the Near East  the United Nations has remained active in its efforts to maintain peace  which is the fundamental requirement for the development of all forms of international co-operation which ensure solidarity among men and nations.4.	We must not fail to realize that part of this general and constructive activity has been the resolutions on general and complete disarmament  the Treaties relating to the nuclear test-ban and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  which inspired the recently concluded agreements among the great Powers. Consideration has also been given to the elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and to the peaceful use of the sea-bed and outer space  and to policies to halt the arms race  the economic and social consequences of which have been delaying the integral development of the largest portions of the world's population. Of great significance for peace too are the efforts and achievements of the United Nations in the liberation of peoples under the colonial yoke. In Korea its efforts  together with those of the Korean people  have done much to reunify that great nation. In the human rights field  we here reaffirm our faith in the work of the United Nations and in the principles of its Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and we condemn all policies of racial discrimination which denigrate the human person.5.	Guatemala  therefore  reiterates both its support for the purposes which inspired the establishment of the United Nations as an Organization of the entire international community and its full respect for the legal principles incorporated in the Charter; we also support compliance with all the obligations which that legal instrument imposes on the Members of this Organization. Specifically  we reaffirm the competence of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  and we believe there is a need to strengthen the Organization so that it may attain this common objective of mankind.6.	As for the growing effort to develop universal co-operation under United Nations sponsorship in an effort to preserve and improve the human environment  I wish to say that Guatemala participated with great interest in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June of this year  at which my delegation was honored to represent the fraternal Governments of Costa Rica and El Salvador.7.	In the light of the results of the Stockholm Conference  Guatemala expresses its intention to co-operate internationally in implementing the standards and principles incorporated by world consensus in the historic Declaration of the Conference.  At the same time  the Government of my country intends  at the national level  to take all measures it deems appropriate to improve the quality of the environment and to preserve the ecological balance as part of its programs for economic and social development  the ultimate purpose of which is the continuous improvement of the Guatemalan standard of living.8.	Consistent with its traditional position  my Government will support in this Assembly any action to permit the participation of the developing countries in the machinery and programmes of the United Nations related to the human environment  and will promote all international efforts in this field  as long as they equitably respond to the aspirations and needs of the developing countries.9.	My Government has also endorsed General Assembly resolution 2750 C (XXV)  in which the Assembly decided to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973  recognizing ""the need for early and progressive development of the law of the sea"". The peoples of America are fully aware that we depend on natural resources for our subsistence and regionally we have proclaimed the right to protect  preserve and develop those resources and to ensure their use and exploitation  including primarily those of the sea  the legal regime for which in the Americas was consolidated in 1956  by the Principles of Mexico on the Juridical Regime of the Sea  which are recognized:""... as the expression of the juridical conscience of the Continent  and as applicable between the American States""; and more recently by the following:""That the economic and social development of all the peoples and the assurance of equal opportunities for all human beings are essential conditions for peace;""That the renewable and non-renewable resources of the sea contribute to improve the standard of living of the developing countries and to stimulate and accelerate their progress;""That such resources are not inexhaustible since even the living species may be depleted or extinguished as a consequence of irrational exploitation or pollution;""That the law of the sea should harmonize the needs and interests of States and those of the International Community"". [A/8721  pp. 70-71.]The American States  meeting last June  laid down in the Declaration of Santo Domingo [ibid.  pp. 70-73] the legal standards for the territorial sea  the patrimonial sea  the continental shelf  the international sea-bed  the high seas  pollution of the sea and regional co-operation  which are to prevail as a protection and safeguard of the rights and interests of our peoples.10.	The present Government of Guatemala is the result of an election held in accordance with the constitutional and legal procedures of our country and in keeping with the purest democratic processes and the free interplay of political parties. The people of Guatemala exercised their right to self-determination and elected the government of their choice. And yet my Government has had to face the problem  now widespread throughout the world  of subversion and terrorism by extremist and clandestine minority groups. My Government  with the resources available to it under its Constitution and laws  has proceeded to bring to the country peace  which is indispensable to continuing the irreversible task of improving the social  cultural and economic life of the nation in order to attain the development level necessary in the world during the times we live in. The constant action of terrorism  which weakens peoples  together with defects in the factors for development  led the President of the Republic  on celebrating our independence  to declare:""The sum of many weaknesses produces only inferior countries  and if we have no strength or resolution to improve the quality of our life in our national community  independence will merely be a symbol  but not a reality.""11.	Our Government has viewed with concern the intensification of terrorist activities in various parts of the world characterized by kidnapping and coercion with a continuous threat to the lives and property  of our own citizens and of foreigners; this in some cases has led to the criminal and unspeakable assassination of the victims. This is a breach of the most sacred human right  the right to life  and is particularly reprehensible because of its cruelty and cowardness and because it shows total scorn for the legal institutions which have been created to bring about harmony and the common good of society. We consider that a state of law cannot accept such crimes and extortions by attributing to them apparently political motives when by their commission what is intended is to create a general atmosphere of insecurity and collective fear  and a lack of confidence that public order will officially be ensured  thus provoking a crisis in the rule of law and bringing about political and social chaos.12.	Given that situation  my Government reiterates its complete support for resolution 4 (I-E/70)  which was adopted on 30 June 1970 by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States  at its first special session  in which acts of terrorism  and especially the kidnapping of persons and extortion connected with that crime  were condemned as crimes against humanity. That resolution also establishes that those acts constitute grave common crimes and recommends that Member States adopt such measures as they may deem suitable  in the exercise of their sovereignty  to prevent and when appropriate to punish crimes of this kind  and to facilitate the exchange of information that will help in the prevention and punishment of crimes of this kind.13.	My Government considers that kidnapping and other attempts upon the life  physical integrity or freedom of persons constitute common crimes  whatever the motives for which they are committed and that acts of terrorism  including the kidnapping of persons for purposes of blackmail  do not constitute either political crimes or their related common crimes.14.	My delegation will support any draft resolution submitted to this General Assembly the purpose of which is to develop international co-operation in order to preserve the community of nations from terrorism which threatens the stability  democracy and the security of our institutions and the well-being of our peoples.15.	On another subject but in connexion with the internal and regional action of my Government  I wish to declare that in our desire for economic improvement we are continuing to implement the five-year integral development plan  land reform and institutional and fiscal reforms intended to raise the standard of living of the nation. Regionally  Guatemala continues to participate actively in the Central-American Common Market  which  despite the various crises which have arisen in the past years  continues its forward march. The' process of industrialization is continuing  but in order to bring about the economic well-being which we aspire to for the people of Guatemala  we need the co-operation of the international community  and particularly that of the highly industrialized countries.16.	At the important third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  held at Santiago  Chile  in April and May 1972  we pointed out that there was a lack of understanding for the problems which affect countries such as ours  which are at a relatively low stage of development. We' observed this lack of understanding not only among the industrialized countries but also in some of the more advanced developing countries.17.	Exports of farm and agricultural products are and will continue to be very important in earning foreign exchange in Central America. Guatemala is convinced of the need to strengthen the international agreements on commodities  such as coffee or sugar  but we believe that for the least developed countries different criteria should be applied from those that are applied to the other developing countries which have reached a more advanced level of economic progress. In determining quotas  the index of industrial development must be taken into account  as well as dependence on the product in question  the nature and availability of natural resources and  in general  the degree of socio-economic development of the country.18.	One of the major obstacles we are confronting in the path towards development is the unjust  arbitrary and artificial payment of our labor in the international markets. To be able to move ahead it is necessary that there be established some machinery whereby we shall be able to obtain an equitable price for our commodities.19.	It is also imperative to proceed to greater liberalization of the tariff barriers of all the industrialized countries so as to permit the growing participation of the goods of the developing countries in their markets.20.	The establishment of a new international monetary order  in which the developing countries will participate fully  is indispensable for economic development. Small countries should not have to suffer the consequences of economic imbalances for which they are not in the least responsible.21.	We reiterate our complete support for regional economic integration  being convinced that it is only through it that we can achieve full development. This integration  however  must be carried out taking very much into consideration the socio-economic disparities in various countries. Central America is made up of five least developed countries  a category which has been accepted in the Central American subregion as well as at the Latin American level. Worldwide  the additional criteria should be adopted to identify least developed subregions  which could be considered as a unit  so that special measures could be applied to them to promote their economic development and integration.22.	As regards peace in the region of Central America  my country has carried out intense diplomatic activity intended to make it easier for two brother countries  which have in the past had tragic moments of armed conflict  to return to cordial relations by a settlement of their differences on the basis of the standards of international law  living together in peace  co-operation and solidarity  with full respect for the sovereignty and independence of States in their quest to carry out their legitimate interests.23.	Lastly  I wish to affirm that the Republic of Guatemala has had with the United Kingdom a dispute of more than 100 years over our territory of Belize  which is occupied by that Power. Years ago Guatemala agreed to submit this dispute to the peaceful means for the settlement of disputes established in international law and prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations as mandatory for States Members of the Organization. Good Offices  mediation and direct negotiations have occupied our special attention in seeking a just and equitable solution which will make it possible to restore the territory of Belize to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Guatemala while not ignoring the interests of the population living there. My Government reiterates that it will oppose any change in the legal and political status of Belize without a prior and complete settlement of the problem of the rights of Guatemala over that territory."
"48",2929,"GUY",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is a distinct pleasure on this opening day of the general debate to welcome you to your high office and to congratulate you on the distinction which your devoted national service and your country's contribution to the affairs of the international community have earned for you personally and for Poland  and to pledge to you the support of my delegation as  throughout this session  you guide the deliberations of the Assembly with wisdom and fairness.101.	As I do so  Mr. President  may I join in the tributes already paid to your distinguished predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Mr. Adam Malik  for the standards of excellence which characterized the discharge of his responsibilities during the last session. It is a source of particular satisfaction to the Government and people of Guyana that we should have been able to welcome him to our country before the twenty-seventh session began. This Organization and the international community stand greatly indebted to Mr. Malik for the service he has given in so many ways over several years of personal contribution  but most especially  of course  in respect of his work as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.102.	May I also be permitted  in these early hours of the twenty-seventh session  to convey to our distinguished Secretary-General the congratulations of the Government and people of Guyana  and my personal congratulations  on his elevation to the high and exacting office to which he was elected in the closing moments of the twenty-sixth session. I wish to assure him that he may look with certainty to Guyana for all such assistance and support as is within our power to give  in all his efforts to uphold the principles of the Charter and to secure for an impatient world the attainment of the aims and objectives of the Organization.103.	The commencement of each new session of this Assembly is  in effect  a renewal of the pledge made by the peoples of the world on the establishment of the United Nations. That pledge  as embodied in the Charter  and the promise of a better world which it implied  are as relevant and as valid today as they were in 1945. Each session of this Assembly is  therefore  both an occasion of commitment and an occasion of opportunity. The fact that so many of the leaders of the world will participate in this general debate should be sufficient testimony to our commitment and to our determination to use the opportunities of the session to advance the objectives of the Organization.104.	But it would be idle to pretend that this is how we are seen by the vast majority of those of the world's people who take an interest in our proceedings. The level of their skepticism is the measure of our annual failures. How to reduce that level  how to redress those failures  how to match our performance to our protestations is the real challenge of each Assembly. Unless we accept that challenge squarely  we shall in this Assembly still further diminish the chances of success which attend not only our own efforts here but those of all other organs of the United Nations  of the Secretary-General and his officers  of the specialized agencies  of the Security Council itself.105.	It is  therefore  to these wider perspectives of commitment and of opportunity that I invite attention  rather than to the particular issues with which the Assembly and its Committees will be concerned in the months ahead. To the resolution of these issues my delegation will  in due course  offer the modest contribution of a small State  informed by the considerations of principle which I shall attempt to outline.106.	It is perhaps in the nature of man that resolution diminishes as urgency recedes. Had it been otherwise  the determination to ensure a regime of peace  of justice and of progress in the world which was the genesis of this Organization would have been sustained long after the scourge of war and the untold sorrow it had brought to mankind had passed. If  indeed  it be so-and the record of this Organization's work  despite its many notable achievements  all too readily bears witness that it is there is a manifest need for each Assembly to be alerted to the several scourges that still darken the prospect of a peaceful  just and habitable world.107.	But merely to chronicle these deficiencies and imperfections  these dangers and uncertainties  is not enough; for does not their very existence signify the complacency and indeed the indifference of a world in which those who exercise the power of decision-making or control the means of implementation are willing to make an accommodation with them? Can there be hope of sustained resolution  therefore  can there be expectation that professed commitment will be translated into durable reality  so long as the acknowledged crisis in international affairs does not threaten imminent national disaster  or at least imminent national disaster for the major Powers? If there is  indeed  a possibility that the answer can be yes that resolution may be sustained  that commitment may be fulfilled-that possibility would seem to lie in the emergence of some consciousness of global need  of which mankind otherwise becomes possessed.108.	In the area of human consciousness  developments unfold slowly. Indeed  it is sometimes difficult to be sure when ideas nurtured slowly emerge fully into the consciousness of men. It is just possible  however  that within our own time we may be seeing the emergence of an idea which has hitherto appeared only as a hint or a glimmer of truth but which possesses the potential of moving mankind with a new resolution and a revived urgency.109.	In its beginnings  the current perception that the preservation of tire environment must be tire concern of all mankind derived from the perception of the developed States that the pollution which accompanies their major industries can endanger and irretrievably damage life- support systems of air  land and water on our planet Earth. Out of this perception there has emerged  principally but not exclusively in the developed world  a growing concern over disturbances to the ecological balance of the biosphere and a new awareness of the finiteness of the world's resources of ocean  atmosphere and land  a concern and an awareness which are beginning to exert an influence on matters that affect the peace of the world and the quality of life on earth. We are  in fact  witnessing the birth of a new sense of community between man and the other life forms  a sense of belonging to and living together on a small planetary body whose limited resources are the heritage of all life.110.	Few will doubt that this insight marks a further advance in man's development. It would greatly diminish that advance  however-indeed  it might altogether frustrate it-if this perception of the interdependence of life is held at the level of concern from which it derived and its deeper implications for man's relationship with man are not acknowledged and pursued. The belief that the acknowledgment and pursuit of these implications are unavoidable  the recognition that it would be futile to develop a planetary strategy based on the unity of man with other life forms while ignoring those factors of inequality that frustrate and destroy the unity of mankind  and those realities of tension and conflict that impair the quality and threaten the existence of human life itself-each is reason enough to hope that we may be at a point of special significance in the evolution of international community effort.111.	The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment sustains this hope by its implicit acceptance that the physical interdependence of all people requires new dimensions of economic  social and political interdependence; by its express proclamation of man's ""fundamental right to freedom  equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being"";  by its demand that ""policies promoting or perpetuating apartheid  racial segregation  discrimination  colonial and other forms of oppression and foreign domination stand condemned and must be eliminated""; by its acknowledgment that environmental problems are products not merely of industrial development but of under-development  that  for the developing countries  their development must be a priority bearing in mind the need to safeguard and improve the environment and that  for the same purpose  the industrialized countries should make efforts to reduce the gap between themselves and the developing world.112.	These particular asseverations and exhortations are  of course  not new. They stand inscribed in many an international convention for which this Organization itself has been responsible. What is new is that they now stand inscribed as concomitant features of a program for human survival  a program inspired by the desperate understanding that ""to defend and improve the human environment for present and future generations has become an imperative goal for mankind"" a program that derives from mutual need and demands the reciprocal efforts of all States and peoples.113.	It needs to be appreciated that in the developing world this concept of mutuality is of paramount importance in any assessment of these developments. programs for the preservation of the human environment deriving mainly from abuses of the environment by the developed countries will stand little chance of universal respect  and therefore of success  unless conceived in terms which acknowledge the new dimensions of economic  social and political interdependence.114.	In moving  therefore  to a new level of planetary consultation it is essential that there be kept on the agenda all items that bear upon the quality of human life  so that the full resources of the planetary community are brought to their resolution. It may have been arguable that some of these matters were outside the purview of the Stockholm Conference. They cannot be outside the purview of this Assembly; nor can they be other than directly relevant to that wider concept of environment to which I have referred and which is already a part of our contemporary thought.115.	Let us acknowledge  for example  that not only have the agents of apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa resorted to deliberate destruction of the natural environment but the system itself is built on the denial to some men of what is in fact the natural heritage of all mankind: the right to a life of dignity in freedom and equality. Is it conceivable that one can develop a planetary strategy on the basis of respect for other life when human life itself is subjected to such systematized maltreatment? Racism  whatever form it takes  whether openly defiant or in masquerade  whoever its proponents and whoever its victims  pollutes and contaminates the human environment and deserves universal condemnation as it requires universal redress.116.	And while we ponder man's inhumanities in southern Africa  let us not ignore  or by silence appear to condone  those other abuses of the human personality that have in recent times brought concern and distress to all who labor in the vineyard of international brotherhood. A year ago  from this podium  I suggested  in relation to other cruel and indifferent onslaughts on human dignity:"". . that gross violations of human rights wherever they occur in the world are the legitimate concern of the international community; and that matters cease to be essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a State when they give rise to humanitarian issues of such magnitude that the international community must of necessity grapple with them"" [1943rd meeting  para. 139.J117.	These considerations are as apposite now as then  and my Government has already assured the Secretary-General of support for his efforts to secure a humanitarian approach to the problems of human despair and dislocation in the troubled land of Uganda-problems  let it be acknowledged  which had their beginnings in colonialism. Mindful of the character of our State as a land of many peoples  my Government has likewise indicated its willingness to render such assistance as the circumstances of a small and developing State will permit to those who may be threatened with the terrifying prospect of statelessness.118.	In indoChina  for more than a generation  its people and their environment have been subjected to the prolonged devastation of war-a war which is protracted in response to the power rivalries of external forces. The human environment is not divisible. We cannot secure its preservation in Stockholm if we allow its devastation in Viet-Nam. The ending of conflict in IndoChina is the concern of all men  and the international community  and this Organization in particular  have both a right and a duty to exert an influence in securing it.119.	And how do we interpret the concept of ""an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being"" to the people of Palestine who have been dispossessed of environment itself? As we rightly condemn an international terrorism that strikes indiscriminately at innocent youth and makes the postal authorities of 'the world unconscious messengers of death  let us not forget for it is to the account of all mankind the bitterness and despair arising from deprivation of homeland that lie behind such desperate and abhorrent acts.120.	As we respond to the Secretary-General's proposal to search at this twenty-seventh session for solutions to these problems  let us not believe that we can achieve durable results while ignoring those root-causes that produce them or delude ourselves with formulations that bury those causes still deeper in calculated ambiguity.121.	We cannot afford such delusion; for  suddenly  the world has grown smaller  so that there is no here and beyond  no island of tranquility in a sea of turbulence  no peace anywhere while despair stalks the planet. Are these realities of our time not also an aspect of that perception of interdependence which the concept of environment has sharpened; and should we not begin as a planetary community to accept and to deal with them on these terms? When we do  it may perhaps become easier to recognize that each time the Security Council  through threat or use of the reciprocal veto  fails to discharge its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security we increase still further the frustrations that impel both indiscriminate political violence and no less indiscriminate retaliation; for each such failure still further reduces credibility in the effectiveness of the United Nations and therefore of collective international opinion. The effectiveness of both is essential to global survival.122.	Similar considerations must inform the effort to redress the difference in levels of economic development. It is a sad commentary on our contemporary internationalism that the Stockholm Conference and the third session of UNCTAD could have been events on the international calendar of the same year. The emphasis placed during the debate at Stockholm on"". .. the fact that for two thirds of the world's population the human environment was dominated by poverty  malnutrition  illiteracy and misery  and that the urgent task facing mankind was to solve those immediate and formidable problems .. ."" was reflected in the Declaration itself  which acknowledged that""Environmental deficiencies generated by the conditions of under-development... can best be remedied by accelerated development through the transfer of substantial quantities of financial and technological assistance as a supplement to the domestic effort of the developing countries. .. ."" The Declaration acknowledged also that:""For the developing countries  stability of prices and adequate earnings for primary commodities and raw material are essential to environmental management since economic factors as well as ecological processes must be taken into account.""13But these very truths  so candidly acknowledged at Stockholm  had a few weeks earlier failed to produce commitments at Santiago.123.	What is needed is prompt  translation of such acknowledgments into tangible commitments and early fulfillment of these commitments and of obligations that already exist under the International Development Strategy. And this movement from acknowledgment to fulfillment must cover the whole field of international economic co-operation.124.	It must be evidenced  for example  in the forthcoming trade negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GAIT] so that at both procedural and substantive levels there is a substantial and continuing improvement in the position of the developing countries in international trade.125.	It must find expression in reform of the international monetary system which admits the developing countries to full participation in the decision-making processes rather than leaves them the mere hapless victims of recurring international monetary crises for which they bear no responsibility.126.	All these will be necessary if we are to apply the new insight of environment not merely defensively  in order to hold off the environmental perils that confront industrialized societies  but positively and purposefully  in order to create conditions on earth that will preserve and enhance for every citizen of the world an environment which truly gives him that ""physical sustenance"" and affords him that ""opportunity for intellectual  moral  social and spiritual growth"" of which the Declaration speaks  and which gives and affords them to him on an active and equal basis with all other men.127.	Perhaps no area of current international activity more obviously demands the application of this insight than the current effort to regulate human interaction in the ocean space beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Any perception of the earth as the heritage of all mankind must lend urgency to the arrangements for the international Conference on the Law of the Sea. But it must also surely serve to ensure  once the Conference on The Law of the Sea is convened  that an international regime is established which meets the legitimate demands of the developing no less than those of the developed countries  of the landlocked no less than the coastal States  and that it accommodates all these with the overriding interest of the international community in an orderly and equitable development whose benefits accrue to the people of the world and can be used to solve those prevailing environmental problems which are the products of under-development.128.	The Stockholm Declaration acknowledges that:""Millions continue to live far below the minimum levels required for a decent human existence  deprived of adequate food and clothing  shelter and education  health and sanitation.""14Let the resources of the sea and the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  which are the heritage of all mankind  have as a first charge upon them the redress of these social and economic imbalances; let them be devoted  that is  to the fulfillment of the first principle of the Declaration-the realization of man's ""fundamental right to ... adequate conditions of life  in an environment of equality that permits a life of dignity and well being .. ."".15 A regime of the sea and the sea-bed which thus gives practical fulfillment to the new perception of the unity of man's life with other life would lay sturdy foundations on which we may yet build a more just and therefore a more enduring international system.129.	Let us also  in the cause of preserving and enhancing the human environment  give support and encouragement to efforts for the establishment of zones of peace and co-operation in various regions of the world based on the principles of the Charter and on the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)] so that in their aggregation these zones of peace may advance the cause of comprehensive international security.130.	In this context  let this Assembly help to advance the implementation of the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] adopted at the twenty-sixth session and let it likewise endorse and call upon all States to respect the objective embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 1971  in which five countries of South-east Asia have expressed their determination to secure recognition of and respect for South-east Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free from any form of menace or interference by outside Powers.131.	Perhaps above all let this new awareness of mutual need confirm the urgency of the democratization of international relations. The tendency on the part of the major Powers to monopolize decision-making or to exercise inordinate influence on matters which are the proper concern of all countries continues to be a feature of international life a tendency which the institutional arrangements of this Organization greatly assist by fashioning the Security Council to reflect power differentials between States. Thus  while we welcome the indications of detente among the super-Powers  we must ensure by appropriate reforms that the dialog of peace which it permits is one for all mankind and is not confined within the Chancelleries of a small syndicate of powerful States in negation of the purposes of this Organization.132.	But the processes of democratization will take many forms and high among them must be the universality of membership of this Organization. The restoration of the People's Republic of China to its rightful place in the Organization was an important step in this direction  but further steps must be taken to secure the objective of universality. We must open the doors of this Organization to all those States that seek to enter  and we must encourage those others now without to exercise their influence on international affairs from within the Organization by assuring them of our support for their admission  notwithstanding the problems of division that may have hindered this in the past.133.	But if we are to ensure that the universality of the Organization is effective we will need to go beyond the question of membership and to secure a more broadly- based geographic representation of the people of the world in the principal organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the secretariats of these organizations  and particularly at the policy-making levels. In the long run the major Powers themselves may find that a willingness on their part to take these steps towards making the conduct of international affairs more democratic would better secure the prospect of international peace and co-operation than a stubborn adherence to the power political structure of a passing era.134.	Through all these growing points in our international arrangements it is clearly possible for us to move away from a system in which the use of power or the balance of power is the determinant of change to one in which there is growing acceptance of a complementarity of systems within a single planetary community a community in which change is promoted by conciliation and adjustment and is responsive to a balanced view of the needs of all its peoples. With the emergence of such a planetary order this Organization will assume even greater responsibilities  and it must therefore be a central feature of all our efforts that we enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.135.	For this reason alone the financial plight of the Organization ought to be the concern of all Member States; for these financial problems must impose severe strains on the capacity of the Organization to fulfill even its present functions  much less to equip itself for still further responsibilities. We are  indeed  at a stage in the affairs of the United Nations when it should be the duty of all Member States committed to its effectiveness to take those steps that are necessary to a resolution of existing financial difficulties and to avoid any that are likely to diminish that effectiveness or imperil its legitimate and necessary growth.136.	I spoke a moment ago on the growing points of our international arrangements. High among these  I suggest  is the developing strength of the non-aligned movement  whose most recent consultation  at the level of Foreign Ministers   it was my country's privilege to host just six weeks ago. Nearly two decades before that  at the African- Asian Conference  held at Bandung in April 1955  leaders of a number of Afro-Asian nations had met to demonstrate their newly won freedom  to renew the links between their peoples which had been broken in imperial times and to seek to ensure through solidarity that the momentum of the independence struggle was maintained. They elaborated at Bandung a set of principles on which the international movement of non-alignment was to be shaped. These principles have informed the program hammered out at the great consultations of the movement.137.	At Belgrade in 1961   at a time of heightened international tension  the leaders of the non-aligned nations sought to secure the peace of the world through efforts of mediation. At Cairo in 1964   at a time of lessened tension  they emphasized the need for a program to reshape the international economic system and its institutions and called upon developed States for practical co-operation. At Lusaka in 1970   the emphasis was on the need to democratize international relations and  through self-reliance and mutual assistance  to widen the areas of co-operation among developing States.138.	Each of these responses to the challenges and opportunities of the changing international situation was founded on a commitment to those very principles which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to the advancement of the effectiveness of the United Nations. Today the non-aligned movement  which numbers among its adherents half of the Members of this Assembly  stands foremost among the champions of this Organization and of its aims and objectives.139.	At the Conference of Foreign Ministers held recently in Georgetown this commitment to the United Nations  already elaborately expressed at Lusaka  was reaffirmed and . the Foreign. Ministers rededicated themselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter and reaffirmed their deep conviction that the United Nations provides the most effective means to maintain and promote international peace and security  to strengthen freedom and to harmonize relations between States. They reiterated that the United Nations must not merely reflect developments in contemporary world affairs but  by exerting an influence upon them  contribute to the furtherance of world peace and progress.140.	In its commitment to this Organization  in its efforts in the cause of international peace and security  in its resolute support of fundamental human values and the cause of economic and social justice and  above all  in its steadfastness to the concept of a world of free people and free States  the non-aligned movement is continuing its contribution to the achievement of the aims and objectives of the Charter.141.	On the mandate of the Conference  at the commencement of this session I transmitted its Final Acts to the Secretary-General and requested their circulation as official documents of the United Nations. I have no doubt that as the work of this session proceeds the Georgetown Declaration  the Action program for Economic Cooperation and the related documents of the Conference will make a material contribution to the resolution of outstanding issues.142.	On the occasion of the Georgetown Conference this great movement that knows no boundaries of race or region  of language or of political system  did honor to the pioneers of non-alignment and  more especially  to the international work for a better world of four great men whose vision reached beyond their national horizons and whose courage inspired and advanced a new and more democratic international system. I should like to read into the records of this Assembly the words in which we commemorated those contributions of Gamal Abdel Nasser  of Kwame Nkrumah  of Jawaharlal Nehru  of Josip Broz Tito for all the world is heir to their achievements and the epilogue to their great works may serve also as the prologue to a new chapter of the chronicle of man's endeavors in his restless quest for peace and understanding with himself and with his environment. The words of commemoration read:""Having led their peoples to freedom They did not rest But taking the whole earth for their nation And all peoples for their brothers They sought to free the world from war Gave to the oppressed a sense of dignity and the hope of justiceEnsured for all peoples the right to freedom and independenceAnd to determine and pursue without hindrance The paths of their political economic social and cultural developmentSecured for all States respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity And the right of equality and active participation in international affairsWith them through the Movement of Non-Alignment Our human race took a step forward Towards a world of peace of justice and of progress They began a dialog of all mankind.""143.	If we are to continue that dialog and to give it the dimensions which our new awareness of man's state on this planet requires  there will be need for an effort of truly global proportions in which all men and all States must share. As communication begins to take the place of threat  as bridges are built where barriers stood  as functional co-operation broadens to encompass the survival of life on earth  the need is urgent and the moment propitious for us to make that effort. As we do so  there is no higher priority than to integrate the emerging values into the developing international system. On our willingness to do this in a total way  responsive to the needs of no one community or group of communities but to the needs of mankind seen in their widest perspectives  will depend our chances of advancing towards the ideal of a peaceful  just and habitable planet."
"49",2972,"HND",27,1972,"I extend to every delegation here and to the peoples of whom they are such worthy representatives the welcome of a Central American nation that wishes to live in peace with justice. Peace is born in the hot fire of freedom and is strengthened by democratic equality and the enlightenment of culture and it becomes stabilized through the equitable distribution of wealth. Justice should be founded on reason in evaluating the irrepressible evolution of peoples and respect for the rules of law  both in the relations of the State with man and in the coexistence of nations.258'. I am standing now on this lofty rostrum  which is a sounding board for world political thought  as the representative of the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras. On behalf of that people  of that Government and on my own behalf  I wish to convey my congratulations to Stanislaw Trepczyriski on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this current session  and I also congratulate this Assembly for having made such an unquestionably wise choice in his election.259.	The Republic of Honduras fits its activities into the framework of the rules governing the inter-American system. In order to be consistent in morality and in politics with the precepts of the United Nations  we must remain faithful to our regional institutions which  on the basis of our history and geography  we have created freely as a function of our sovereignty.260.	What is permissible from the standpoint of regional groups is equally permissible from the universal standpoint. In the same way what is punishable within the regional area is also punishable at the international level. That is the criterion that the Republic of Honduras upholds as the rule for its international behavior.261.	The highest aspiration of all peoples is to live in peace with democracy. But it turns out that no word is used so much as the word ""democracy"" by large and small countries  strong and weak countries and free and oppressed countries. Everyone invokes it in the present  past and future. They all advocate it in good faith-and some even in bad faith. And this persistence proves at least that democracy as a political goal provides a system in which human coexistence and well-being are possible for a greater number of the members of society.262.	Whatever may be the techniques and doctrine  it is obvious that a society is a democracy if it is made up of free men. Slavery among men and colonialism among nations are incompatible with the primary function of the Organization that was founded to promote peace and understanding among nations. The peace that is just and lasting is the peace which emanates from the consensus freely arrived at among men at the national level and the free consensus among nations at the international level.263.	Economic or political colonialism  with domination by the metropolitan country and partial or total submission on the part of the colonies  is nothing more than a manifestation of imperialism  intervention or conquest.264.	My country  as an active member of the in -national community  needs and wishes to express its views on certain matters of general interest which  as is the case with other States  affect us directly.265.	An item of the utmost interest is that which concerns world monetary policy. It is essential  in deference to strict justice  that the small countries should be heard and heeded when decisions are made about the world monetary system. Ideally there should be no privileged currencies. But this does not imply that we should overlook the reality which the world teaches us  that in the world some countries are leaders in economic and military matters; rather we should try to ensure that this leadership takes into account the rights to which  in justice and equity  all the nations of the world are equally entitled. What I have said is nothing more than a reaffirmation of a positive principle of international law such as the paragraph in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter which says that the peoples of the world  in adopting that Charter  reaffirm their ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small..."".266.	Freedom to trade peacefully with any country in the world is the inherent right of any country  which no political or economic consideration should restrict. But freedom should be defended both by the developing countries as well as by those that have attained a larger measure of development.267.	International trade presupposes a correlation between cause and effect within the international community. The practice of international trade should be conducted within the ambit of an exceedingly important task of the United Nations  which in this field should be to foster understanding and unity to stimulate and encourage production and progress the basis of well-being and harmony through mutual co-operation among the countries that are its members.268.	We are concerned about our domestic problems  but we are also interested in those which affect other areas of our planet the problems of the Middle East  and the Far East and we would hope that understanding and justice could open the way that will lead to solutions which can restore peace for the good of all peoples.269.	Honduras considers it appropriate emphatically to affirm that it does not recognize  nor will it recognize  the acquisition of territories through the threat or use of force. Moreover  we also state with equal emphasis that we trust in the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations.270.	We are deeply concerned and upset by the recurring outbursts of terrorism which  with exceedingly varied and dramatic features  are seriously affecting many countries. Honduras condemns those passionate and violent forms of action. It considers that international co-operation is essential to eliminate such actions  and we feel that States should vigorously assume the obligation to defend the legal order in their respective jurisdictions and within the international community.271.	In the interests of the application of the principle of universality  we believe that all legally constituted peoples -always provided that they are States which accept and are ready to discharge their responsibilities as members of the international community should be admitted to membership in the United Nations.272.	Honduras  which has always pursued a peaceful tradition in its international relations  expresses its hope that normality will return to the Central American region in the near future.273.	The solution of the problems which emerged from the armed conflict in which we found ourselves involved with a neighboring country today has reached a very advanced stage. In continuing talks in a calm and cordial atmosphere with representatives of the parties concerned  we are discussing appropriate formulas to reach an overall settlement  falling within the seven resolutions which emerged from the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting of theMinisters of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States on 27 October 1969  which provide a solution to all the existing differences  including the question of the determination and demarcation of the frontier between the two countries.274.	We believe that those portions of the frontier line on which we cannot reach agreement by direct settlement should be submitted to arbitration. Arbitration is an eminently legal tool  recognized in international law and universally accepted for the settlement of disputes between States. We American States have specifically proclaimed that principle in the Pact of Bogota.275.	In international law today the concept of frontiers is of significant importance. It no longer merely marks the limits of the jurisdiction of a State  but it has come to constitute a factor for rapprochement and economic and cultural development between nations. Clearly defined frontiers constitute a common good of the adjacent countries and that is why States should lend their cooperation to ensure the accurate definition of their frontiers and to resolve their territorial disputes by the means established under international law.276.	During recent years and in statements made before this General Assembly  my country has reported on the negotiations in which my Government was engaged together with the Government of the United States of America  to gain recognition of Honduran sovereignty over the Swan Islands  which are also known as the Santanilla or Santillana Islands.277.	Today I am gratified to be able to state that our dispute has been settled on pleasant terms. In the city of San Pedro Sula  Honduras  on 22 November 1971  the Government of Honduras and the Government of the United States of America signed a Treaty  article 1 of which provides that the Government of the United States of America recognizes Honduran sovereignty over the aforementioned Islands.278.	That treaty was approved by the legislative Powers of Honduras and of the United States of America  and once the necessary instrument of ratification was deposited in Washington  Honduras took over possession of those islands in a solemn and important ceremony held on 1 September of this year. In making this announcement  I should like to emphasize that the settlement of the aforementioned controversy is an irrefutable example of the fact that disputes between States can be solved within the broad rules of international law  when the parties to the dispute have the will to reach peaceful solutions and have an understanding of the meaning of peace and harmony between peoples and Governments. Honduras sincerely hopes that other countries that have similar disputes will be able to reach satisfactory solutions such as that which I have had the honor to describe to you today.279.	Honduras attended the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea  convened in the Dominican Republic in June 1972  which was attended by representatives of countries which today are represented in this General Assembly  and on 9 June signed the Santo Domingo Declaration [A/8721  annex I  sect. 2]. That Declaration  which had in mind not only the present but also the future of peoples and which beyond question constitutes a new contribution to the evolution of the law of the sea proclaims principles which should certainly be carefully considered by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which is to be convened shortly.280.	My country was also a member of the United Nations Conference on the Human environment which met in Stockholm  Sweden  from 5 to 16 June of this year. My Government considers that if its results are to be given practical application with the urgency that is required and if we are to preserve the earth's resources for the benefit of present generations and as a vital legacy for future generations  an intergovernmental body should be established which would stimulate and guide international co-operation in the area of the human environment.281.	My comments on Central American economic integration deserve a separate paragraph in this statement. Honduras is sincerely devoted to integration. This is a historic truth and a present reality. But integration does not signify the total renunciation by a people of its territorial  political and economic personality. Integration does not mean resignation by a people to suffer permanent disadvantages. Integration means the establishment of business not only for the good of the producers  but rather for the good of the great consumer masses  which are the human foundation of nations. No  integration is the common effort of States  with clearly and permanently defined frontiers  to promote harmonious  accelerated and balanced development  to strengthen their democratic systems and to improve the social and economic conditions of their peoples.282.	All integration is and must be  in its origins and intentions  a common good. To integrate is to form a whole from parts which are separate but identified: ""to integrate"" means to search for and to apply complementary relationships; it means to organize  in harmony and justice  a superior economic unit as a result of the union.283.	For this reason  the notion or concept of economic integration implies the idea of mutual and balanced benefit. If that were not so the alleged integration would be distorted and the process would degenerate and become evil  so that it would lose its perspectives and its original ideals  and give way to the emergence of sordid interests which have greed as their common denominator.284.	I have said all of this because the program of Central American economic integration has  at the present time  suffered a serious setback from which it cannot emerge until it has been subjected to a genuine and far-reaching restructuring which will reorganize its legal machinery  revise its postulates and establish goals which  in the last analysis  will be translated not merely in an increase of trade but also in benefits for all the classes that are participating in the generation of wealth in Central America.285.	Mr. President  the Republic of Honduras  its people and its Government repeat to you their warm and cordial welcome."
"50",3043,"HTI",27,1972,"The Republic of Haiti takes particular satisfaction in extending its warm congratulations to Mr. Trepczynski on his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.127.	We were happy to contribute to his election  recalling the significant gesture of the Polish battalion which  arriving in the colony of Santo Domingo with a Napoleonic expedition under the orders of General Leclerc  refused to bear arms against the Negroes of Haiti  who were fighting fiercely for their freedom and independence. To applaud this lofty sense of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person  Jean-Jacques Dessalines  the Founder of the world's' First Black Republic  forthwith conferred Haitian nationality on the Polish soldiers  who subsequently were among the most ardent defenders of their adopted fatherland.128.	This historic memory  dear to the heart of all Haitians  sufficiently expresses the pride the Haitian delegation takes in offering the President its most loyal cooperation for the success of his mandate.129.	I should also like to hail the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly who  despite numerous difficulties  managed with competence and tact to carry out his delicate mission to the satisfaction of the Members of the Organization.130.	I am speaking on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Jean- Claude Duvalier  President-for-life of the Republic  and of his Government  when I address my most earnest thanks to the members of the General Assembly for the support they offered the Haitian candidate for one of the vice- presidencies of the General Assembly. We see this gesture as a token of appreciation of the ceaseless efforts of the Government of the Republic to improve the living conditions of our people while contributing to the maintenance of a climate of peace  harmony and understanding in the Caribbean.131.	As we begin the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly under the aegis of the great principles which  immediately following the last war  brought together men and nations in a single surge of brotherhood  the world is darkened by the Viet-Nam war  which continues in blood  horror and destruction; the armed conflict between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania  which has inflamed a large part of Africa and is threatening the equilibrium of the continent; the Middle East  where the atmosphere remains explosive while a wave of terrorism is spreading over the world: kidnapping  assassinations  hijackings of aircraft  attacks against persons and property  sequestrations  blackmail with hostages. Terrorism itself leads to counter-terrorism and murderous acts provoke reprisals of the same kind in other words  terror is met with terror. There is an uninterrupted chain of victims which stretches from Lod Airport to the Olympic Games in Munich  to the villages burned in Lebanon and practically to all continents.132.	If these acts have a more immediate impact on the conscience of mankind and underscore the responsibility of each State of the international community  they must not be allowed to obscure the drama of the large majority of the world's population  which is deeply marked by poverty  undernourishment  unemployment  ignorance and sickness.133.	The problem of development  which is closely bound up with the independence of Latin America  has assumed new dimensions with the emancipation of the colonial peoples and has become a demand of the poor countries. The initial phase of piecemeal struggle against the major economic Powers has given way to a sense of solidarity  of common destiny  among the disinherited peoples; to an awareness of the identity of the problems and a more realistic grasp of under-development; an awareness of the need to present a united front in the defense of essential interests  thus emphasizing the weight of the third world in the destiny of our earth. How many distinguished voices have been raised in the defense of this cause! ""The price of primary commodities  above all that of coffee  copper  cocoa and sisal  continues to decline on the international market  whereas at the same time the cost of manufactured products constantly rises""  wrote Dr. Francois Duvalier in 1969. The assistance granted by international organizations is proving to be parsimonious and insufficient in the face of the agonizing problems of development confronting Governments and peoples. These disenchanted considerations of a statesman were echoed three years later at the session of UNCTAD held in Santiago  Chile.134.	The inadequacy of action undertaken in the field of trade and aid policy derives from the attitude of the developed countries  which are preoccupied by the complexity of their own problems: spiraling inflation  pollution  arms policy tied to the will-to-power. And it must be recognized that the rate of transfer of know-how and capital necessary for the third world's economic and social development is proving clearly insufficient.135.	In fact  the third world's economic and technological dependence on the great Powers is becoming more and more marked in the twentieth century.136.	The international community is still confronted with the task of giving practical expression to new trade and aid policies  of finding reasonable solutions to the growing indebtedness of the under-developed countries  of offsetting the burden of debt servicing and its impact on development efforts. No agreement has been forthcoming to date on the vital question for the countries of the third world of preferential access to the markets of the industrialized countries  or on the diversification of agricultural production tied to an increasing volume of assistance. Nevertheless  there are certain things on the plus side: the recognition of the developing countries' right to participate in any reform of the international monetary system  the recognition of the necessity for a transfer of technology to the nations of the third world  and the drafting of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States.137.	In Latin America  in Africa and in Asia the voices of many millions of men are being upraised to claim the right to education  health and happiness. They look to the Second United Nations Development Decade to improve their living conditions.138.	Those who bear the responsibility for the world's destiny must surely be aware that the urgent problems of economic development and disequilibrium between nations and between different social groups within nations are a source of chronic tension and one of the greater threats to peace. With the ever-widening gap between the industrialized and the under-developed countries  a feeling of frustration and despair is overtaking the disinherited of the earth. The moral argument  as well as the clearly understood interest of peoples that are guided by a sense of the future  point to the need to adapt economic and political structures to the new requirements of contemporary thinking while remaining true to the principles of law and solidarity of the United Nations Charter.139.	It is with bitter disappointment that the Republic of Haiti notes that 1971  proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations as ""The International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination"" [resolution 2544 (XXIV)]  has passed without any effective measure being taken to eliminate these brazen practices in South Africa and Rhodesia.140.	The United Nations Charter proclaims the fundamental rights of man  the dignity and worth of the human being  the equality of rights of men and women as well as of nations great and small. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights goes further  recalling that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.141.	Yet  since 1946 the General Assembly has had before it the case of South Africa  where the majority of the people are oppressed by a minority oh the ground of supposed racial superiority. Yet racism persists with its inevitable genocidal component and threatens to become  as former Secretary-General U Thant wrote  a hideous monster ready to devour everything beneficial mankind has thus far succeeded in achieving and of reducing men to a bestial level of hatred and intolerance.142.	To extirpate this virus of racial discrimination  which is tirelessly eroding the international community  means harnessing the progress of science and technology  which are irresistibly drawing humanity towards a universal civilization that will destroy backward and outdated particularisms. It means accepting and respecting the diversity of men in the complexity of their cultural and social- political evolution. It means struggling for social  economic and political justice  for equality of opportunity and for a brotherhood which will guarantee the dignity of man and the effective exercise of his rights.143.	For  when all is said and done  we must realize that racial discrimination does not result primarily from mistaken notions  but is rather an ideological mask for more real conflicts based on the will to enslave and on relations of force. In other words  racism is one of the most abhorrent and degrading vestiges of colonialism  which  unfortunately  mankind has not yet extirpated  despite the profound changes which have taken place since the Second World War.144.	The Republic of Haiti reaffirms the urgency of measures both national and international to implement the instruments of the United Nations aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in order to foster harmonious relations among all races.145.	The General Assembly  and the Security Council in its resolution 310 (1972)  have already condemned this year the refusal of South Africa to withdraw from Namibia. It is urgent that the Secretary-General  in conformity with Council resolution 309 (1972) should be authorized to contact the interested parties so that the Namibian people may freely exercise its right to self-determination and independence.146.	The ethnic and cultural ties that bind the Republic of Haiti to Africa make us still more sympathetic to the desperate lot of those peoples. The delegation of Haiti appeals to the conscience of all Members of the Organization to demand respect for the resolutions and the fundamental principles of the Charter.147.	Upon the inauguration of the proceedings of this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  your spontaneous choice of the Republic of Haiti to occupy one of the vice-presidencies of the Organization  testifying to delegations' appreciation  and sympathy vis-a-vis the Government of our President-for-life  Jean-Claude Duvalier  stimulates our efforts  strengthens our faith in the glorious destiny of our fatherland and encourages us to do still more to assist the United Nations to discharge its delicate and important mission.148.	Almost 18 months ago President Duvalier inaugurated a new international policy based on peace and international co-operation  in respect for the principles of non-intervention  self-determination and the inalienable right of peoples freely to decide their destiny.149.	The particular and close ties that history and geography have forged over the centuries between our country and the Dominican Republic explain wV' we should have looked first to that country. The converse ions which took place both in port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo have created a climate of confidence and harmony which took practical form in agreements on cultural exchange  while new economic and trade conventions are now being negotiated by experts of the two countries. Their signature will reaffirm the bonds already existing between the two States and at the same time help to strengthen their political stability. The Republic of Haiti invites all the peoples of the Caribbean ardently struggling to better themselves at this crossroads of races and civilizations to join in this co-operation for the full flowering of our rich potentials.150.	In March of this year a Haitian good-will mission left for Washington  where it set forth the main lines of the policy of social justice of its Government  of progressive harmonization of interests of different sectors. At the State Department  at the Pentagon  the Haitian plenipotentiaries were received with warmth  and with their American counterparts laid the basis for a new era of co-operation between these two oldest independent republics of our hemisphere. In return  representatives of the Agency for International Development and an American military mission came to Port-au-Prince to discuss practical conditions for collaboration between the two Governments in the fields of the economy  arms  and technical assistance.151.	At the same time the deep linguistic and cultural affinities between Haiti and France  which go back more than three centuries and which found such happy expression in the brilliant intellectual qualities of Dr. Francis Duvalier  encouraged a rapprochement between France and Haiti at a time when the policies of the late General de Gaulle  seeking to restore to France its place in the world  were bearing fruit. There was an important exchange of letters between Presidents Jean-Claude Duvalier and Georges Pompidou. At the invitation of the French Government a sizable Haitian mission went to Paris for talks on economic and financial matters and signed a specific agreement for the development in Haiti of French cultural and technical co-operation services. In the Federal Republic of Germany  Italy  Israel and Lebanon  this same delegation continued its cordial talks that promise much for the future of our relations with these friendly countries.152.	Vis-a-vis Latin America  President Duvalier has adopted a policy of openness and understanding inspired by our highest pan-American traditions. The misunderstandings and misinterpretations perpetuated by factions blinded by their own interests  wealth and privileges and  insensible to the physical and moral sufferings of the great majority of the people  were thus dispelled. The humanitarian nature of the Duvalierist revolution  the strength of its ideology which has aroused in the nation psychological stimuli capable of engendering the hope  energy and enthusiasm that are essential to the effort for a new start-this Christian revolution  as was attested by the happy negotiations with the Holy See-was presented in its true light. The nobility of its purpose in seeking to improve the human lot in Haiti was properly understood.153.	In December 1971  the Republic of Haiti resumed diplomatic and consular relations with Costa Rica; in April 1972 with Ecuador; and on 8 June of that same year with Venezuela  to which we are bound by fraternal relations which go back to the time when Bolivar was struggling for the independence of Latin America.154.	Thus  less than two years after his inauguration  President Jean-Claude Duvalier has given  in the concern for the honor and dignity of his country  a dynamic impetus to the pan-Americanism of which Haiti was the cradle.155.	Since the object of all international co-operation  as of all development policies  remains the human being and the satisfaction of his needs  both physical and moral  the Government of the Republic of Haiti has resolutely pursued the establishment of a national infrastructure  the construction of roads  schools  dispensaries and hospitals; with the Francois Duvalier hydro-electric plant at Peligre the production of electric power has been doubled. New channels of co-operation have been opened with the international finance agencies: the Inter-American Development Bank  the International Monetary Fund  and the World Bank. To illustrate these new relations  I shall simply mention the latest loan of $10 million granted by the World Bank to help improve our drinking water supply.156.	Thanks to this political stability that only the confidence and the dedication of the people can maintain  a favorable climate has been created for private investment  tourist complexes  hotels  the development of beaches  factories  and sugar plants. All the parameters of the Haitian economy confirm this improvement  this renaissance  the fruit and the result of our revolution of social justice.157.	The policy of openness  reconciliation and entente that President Duvalier inaugurated  holding out the hand of friendship to erstwhile adversaries and enemies  is reflected in the return home of former diplomats  parliamentarians  politicians and soldiers  where they are freely going about their business under the protection of the law and administrative authority.158.	The explosive nature in the situation in the Middle East is now evident to us all. From the war in Sinai  to the Six-Day War  from the bloody days of Munich  which stripped the Olympic Games of their symbolism of peace  to the reprisals against towns in Syria and Lebanon  the conflict is going beyond the Middle East and a bewildered world is now asking itself where this chain of passions and violence will stop.159.	For five years now Ambassador Gunnar Jarring has been working with zeal and dedication in the quest for a practical solution within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Faced with this situation  which is developing so dangerously and in which certain great Powers dream of satisfying their ancient dream of hegemony  in the face of this crisis where alliances  misunderstandings and ruptures succeed one another  it is necessary to appeal to the wisdom and comprehension of the parties concerned  and thus to spare the civil populations and war prisoners further suffering. Is there no other way but war  between the resolve of the Arab countries to force the Israelis to abandon the occupied territories and Israel's determination to seek safety within secure frontiers? In any event  it is certain that the escalation of violence leads nowhere.160.	A resolute champion of peace  the Haitian Government  as President Jean-Claude Duvalier has said  supports the theory of secure frontiers for all States including Israel. If they did not feel for ever hostages to a past marked by struggle  hatred and confrontation  the two parties could undertake  under the aegis of our Organization  a constructive dialog which could lead to peaceful coexistence and which would meet the wishes of all men of goodwill.161.	Would it not be a good thing-and this is the wish of the Republic of Haiti -at this time  when the unhappy peoples of the Middle East are chafing at the fate that condemns them to a state of war  exhausts economic resources and prevents the flourishing of any social life  for the United Nations to intervene and revive the Jarring mission so as to advance the cause of peace and encourage the parties to re-examine the problem with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution of the conflict?162.	It was in this same spirit of dialog and in the conviction of the desirability of bilateral conversations that our delegation noted the new relations between South and North Korea. At this stage of the negotiations  which hold out hope for a happy outcome  the Government of Haiti considers that public debates based on ideological opposition would risk closing the way to the necessary reciprocal concessions and provoke a hardening of positions. Therefore  my delegation is in favor of the proposal that the two parties should be left free to carry on their bilateral conversations in a spirit of mutual understanding derived from their common origin. In the light of these considerations  the Republic of Haiti is absolutely in agreement that the question of Korea should be postponed to the next session of the General Assembly.163.	The Government of Haiti has also followed with keen interest the new Ostpolitik of the Federal Republic of Germany and the initiation of new East-West contacts in Europe with a view to restoring the peace  reconciliation and fraternity of sports of which Chancellor Willy Brandt had hoped to make Munich the symbol. The Moscow Treaty  the recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and the complementary arrangements are all positive steps in this policy  at the same time as the continuance of conversations between the two Germanys for the normalization of their relations.164.	The United Nations can achieve its universal vocation only with the representation of all nations that make up the international community. Ideological conflicts bound up with political rivalries have thus far kept outside it human entities which have displayed their vitality in the building of modern civilization. This seems to be the case with the two German States  whose admission to this Organization the Assembly may be led to consider at this session. The admission of one to the detriment of the other would  we believe  be no solution to the problem. On the contrary  it would tend to widen still further the gap between these two States and would impede progress towards a satisfactory solution of the German problem. What the United Nations needs is less a broad range of State delegations than a continuous determination  constantly renewed  on the part of its Members  to COP tribute to the welfare of agonized humanity. The delegation of the Republic of Haiti believes that it would be a good idea to postpone consideration of the admission to the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic until such time as the parties directly concerned have found adequate solutions to the problems that have arisen from the division of Germany.165.	In the struggle of the peoples of the third world for better living conditions  the sea and the immense riches it contains have aroused new hopes. In this regard one may rightly recall the importance of the decision taken within the strict framework of their sovereignty by most countries of Latin America  which have fixed the limit of their territorial waters at 200 nautical miles.166.	At the initiative of Venezuela  almost all the countries of Central America and the Caribbean  including the Republic of Haiti  met at Caracas in order in the spirit of Bolivar -that is to say  of pride  independence and pan- American solidarity- to consider the problems of the law of the sea  scientific investigations into the natural resources of the sea and the sea-bed and technological co-operation in that zone  taking into account the geographical characteristics of the region. The idea was to review the possibilities of exploiting the biological and mineral resources of the Caribbean sea  of deep drilling and also of guaranteeing the common and specific interests of the coastal countries.167.	In June 1972 the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on the Problems of the Sea met at Santo Domingo. The participants  while underlining the urgent economic needs of the peoples of the region  stressed the fact that the renewable and non-renewable resources of the sea help to raise the living standards of the developing countries and to stimulate and accelerate their progress. They also pointed out that the maritime resources are not inexhaustible  because even living species can decline or disappear as a result of irrational exploitation or contamination. The essential points of the conclusions of that Conference  called upon to play a certain role in the development of the Caribbean countries and in their mutual relations  specified that all States had a right to fix their territorial waters at the limit of 12 nautical miles measured from the base line. Furthermore  the coastal States should exercise the rights of sovereignty over the natural resources  renewable or non-renewable  located both within the patrimonial sea and on the continental shelf  that is to say  the sea-bed and the subsoil of the submarine zones adjacent to the shore  or to a total distance of 200 nautical miles from the shore line. These conclusions  to which the Republic of Haiti fully adheres  respect the maritime interests of the international community and the regime of the high seas and the sea-bed  which are part of the common heritage of mankind. Thus  the countries of the Caribbean are demonstrating that economic and technological co-operation are possible and essential between under-developed peoples. They offer this example to the brother countries of the third world and emphasize the immense unexploited riches which are to be found in their local seas and which could powerfully contribute to their economic development and the strengthening of their independence.168.	It must be recognized that among the problems of concern to mankind that of disarmament is one of the most important and most agonizing. Despite the reiterated appeals of the General Assembly  the arms race  which threatens the world with the specter of a nuclear war that could destroy all life on the planet  is continuing. We note with concern that the nuclear Powers are continuing indefinitely to strengthen their military arsenals  while others are engaging in nuclear and thermonuclear tests  in the atmosphere and underground  the better to enhance the destructive power of the atom.169.	The United Nations should intervene decisively to put an end to this insane competition  which is a serious threat to world peace and which is swallowing up considerable resources in order to maintain what is known as the ""balance of terror"". The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex] the Moscow Agreement limiting anti-ballistic missile systems and strategic offensive weapons  signed in May  and the Tlatelolco Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America are among the initiatives which are to be encouraged and supported.170.	It is clear that all the money which is futilely spent on armaments could be used to attack the fundamental problem of our time  that of under-development.171.	Bilateral and multilateral co-operation would make it possible to restore a fairer balance in expenditures  which would certainly have a positive effect on terrorism and would help to strengthen peace  the peace which His Holiness Pope Paul VI thought would be possible only through ""generalized development"".172.	Terrorism  which has now become an international issue  is a matter of growing concern everywhere. Violence  which used to be limited in character  thanks to modern communications  has now spread to almost all continents  and the situation is aggravated by the use of modern arms and technology. Going beyond mere individuals  terrorist groups are now setting up full-blown organizations. They have their agents and representatives in various cities; they have their budgets and their sources of arms supply. They know the addresses and habits of their victims; they know the times of arrival and departure of aircraft  and they are present at international meetings.173.	The political aspect of terrorism is complicated when it is associated with national  racial and ideological claims or with the struggle of guerrilla forces  or when it is the alleged last resort of those who are beset by poverty and have lost all hopes in national and international institutions.174.	Terrorism in its full scope is part of the moral erosion of mankind  characterized by unlimited competition  by the unleashing of egoisms  and it is a threat to the permanent values of the modern world. Are these signs of the imminent downfall of our civilization  as seen by Paul Valery when he judiciously recalled that civilizations  too  are mortal?175.	Our age  which has seen the curious coexistence of science and illiteracy  is growing exhausted  as once did ancient Rome  on the one hand foundering in wealth and luxury  and on the other in poverty and physical and moral destitution. Recently a voice of great authority noted that we are now entering upon a phase similar to that which preceded the fall of Rome.176.	Following the Munich tragedy  President Duvalier condemned terrorism in general and acts of barbarism which arouse the reprobation of the international conscience and imperil the peace  comprehension  solidarity and fraternity which should characterize relations between peoples and races.177.	The Republic of Haiti considers that collective measures  supported by all Governments no matter what their ideology  could put an end to these kidnappings  seizures  assassinations and aerial hijackings  which are infringing the rights of individuals and nations. We therefore offer our undeserved support to the resolutions to that end which will be submitted at this twenty-seventh session.178.	The panorama which we have just sketched would leave little room for hope did we not believe in man's capacity to see obstacles as a challenge to fetch up  from the roots of his humanity  the conscience and energy necessary to transcend particularism and feed the hopes of universal fraternity and solidarity in the reconciliation of man with himself  of man with nature  and of man with his neighbor.179.	If the specter of under-development and its painful aftermath continues to hunt four fifths of the world's population  intermittent violence punctuates international relations and creates a general atmosphere of insecurity  there are still some glimmers of hope to light the path of mankind. First of all there is the fact that we are gathered together in this hall to discuss questions of common interest. It is true that for 27 years now we have been coming from all over the world to take part in this exchange of views and even though the results rarely meet our expectations  each year we take up the task again as if to signify our determination to keep alive the United Nations  which  when all is said and done  represents the supreme body for the maintenance of peace and security.180.	We must not overlook the importance of the East-West detente  which seems to be relegating to history what used to be known as the cold war.181.	The Tlatelolco Treaty  which definitively established the denuclearization of Latin America  represents an encouraging precedent for all peoples that love fertile and constructive peace. Against the same background we should also consider the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  which represent a milestone in the efforts to safeguard the values of our civilization.182.	The present efforts are not confined to the mere preservation of the status quo. They are also directed towards the improvement of the quality of life. The impassioned debates on ecology and the environment mark a growing awareness of the problems posed by the consumer society and may usher in a new era of civilization in which man will rediscover his sense of proportion and natural equilibrium.183.	It is no less important to emphasize the formation of large economic groupings as a factor for peace and progress. The European Economic Community has become a power to be reckoned with in the great debate for the survival of mankind. Its existence is changing the balance of force which once made the future of the world dependent on an extreme ideological polarization. It has shaken up the rules of the game  introducing an element of equilibrium which broadens horizons and multiplies possibilities for the peoples of the third world wishing to safeguard their national identity and their cultures and wishing themselves to determine the conditions for the exploitation of their natural riches. Of course the European Common Market has not yet reached its full power  but its weight can decisively influence major international decisions.184.	The countries of the third world are following the example of Europe. Groupings and sub-groupings have been  or are being  formed in various parts of the world. In Latin America  the concepts of economic integration and of a free exchange area are finding practical expression and giving pan-Americanism a new dimension. In Africa similar associations reflect the determination of the African States to surmount their deferences and consolidate their independence.185.	The outlines of a new world are taking shape before our eyes. In addition to the great economic groupings formed by States whose territories constitute natural geographic regions  other broader ensembles are aborning. We should like to mention here the association of all the peoples that are bound together by the French language and culture  without distinction as to race or ideology. Quickened by the breath of France  this association is based on the common desire of the member countries to exploit the wealth of their cultural experience in a spirit of solidarity and fraternity.186.	All these manifestations of goodwill reflect our concern to harness the aspirations and anxieties of youth in order to build a world commensurate with twentieth- century man. But the Republic of Haiti  whose entire history constitutes an illustration of the maxim that nothing great can be achieved without sacrifice  cannot take refuge in exaggerated optimism. It has resolutely taken the road of national effort. In accordance with the Charter of Algiers   according to which it is for the developing countries themselves to assume responsibility for their development  our revolution of social justice is changing the economic and social structures  mobilizing the capacities  energies and resources and guaranteeing the participation of all in the benefits of the collective effort.187.	If we have emphasized the steps being undertaken to preserve mankind from decline and catastrophe  mentioning the signs for hope  it is to exhort us all to go on opening new paths and to mount a vigilant guard around the United Nations. In spite of its limitations  its inadequacies  and even its failures  the United Nations represents the highest political conscience of mankind. I also take this opportunity to reaffirm the unshakable dedication of the people and Government of Haiti to the ideals of peace and development inscribed in the Charter.188.	That is why the delegation of Haiti wishes to convey to this Assembly the fraternal greetings and the fervent hopes of His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier  President-for-life of the Republic of Haiti  for the full success of the twenty-seventh session."
"51",3087,"HUN",27,1972,"One of the major characteristics of the present world situation is that we have very good news and very bad news at the same time.25.	The most recent very good news was that representatives of the thermonuclear Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  declared in a joint ceremonial act  with the participation of Foreign Minister Gromyko and President Nixon in Washington  the coming into force of their Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems  signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972. In a matter of crucial importance to the future of all mankind  the effort to stop the danger of a thermonuclear war from increasing  this is indeed a historic event.26.	On the other hand  it is very bad news that almost simultaneously B-52 bombers directed one of their most massive attacks against the Democratic Republic of VietNam.27.	In this state of international relations two sorts of opinions can be heard in the general debate at the current session of the General Assembly. The vast majority of Member States have been pleased to note the generally favorable change in the world situation. Some speakers  on the other hand  have talked as if there had been no improvement in international relations and  what is even worse as if the phenomena regarded by others as signs of improvement actually portended new dangers. This concern expressed in statements by a good number of speakers has been given voice for very respectable reasons. But there have been speakers on this rostrum who think that the sublimated right and good of mankind would be served by the outbreak of a thermonuclear war. Those who have expressed such views have not even attempted to make any constructive proposal reflecting what their Governments believe to be a way to solve the problems. There being two kinds of tones heard in this debate  we cannot turn a deaf ear to the negative voices. I am sure  though  that the negative voices will gradually be isolated and dwindle away. Even at this session of the General Assembly they have diminished in number  extent and intensity alike. We must nevertheless take seriously those facts upon which they feel they have a right to build their absurd concept of the world situation. And we ought to do so even in the absence of such deplorable and negative utterances.28.	I would have very many reasons to begin my statement by explaining my Government's views on the most favorable aspects of the present international situation  first of all because Hungary is a European country and the most promising signs can be seen in Europe. It is also an exceptional case in the history of the United Nations that both the President of the General Assembly and  the Secretary-General of the United Nations are representatives of European countries. It has been in these days that for the first time in the history of Europe a joint conference was held by the mayors of all European capitals  and that conference took place precisely in Budapest  the capital city of Hungary.29.	Still  I shall not start with this. I am going to expound my Government's position  not on the favorable  but on the unfavorable phenomena  in the hope that there will be an improvement in relations where they need improving; that is to say  that the improvement of international relations will be extended to areas in which the obsolete rules of life of a bygone world are still kept alive.30.	It is clear that we live in revolutionary times. We are witnessing great changes of which we are at the same time passive and creative factors. There is a variety of adjectives to describe the forces in the world today. It can be said that there are peaceful forces and aggressive forces. It can be said that there are progressive forces and reactionary forces. Blended with all these  it can be said  there are forces  governments and aspirations which put into effect measures workable at a given time and place  for they understand the call of the times; and there are those which  by putting unworkable measures into effect  make themselves out of step  for they cannot understand the call of the times. There are people  individuals  governments and statutory measures that have outlived their time.31.	In the thermonuclear age the peoples have to reexamine the practices  laws and international relations they have maintained thus far  their conception of international law  the ideas they have of the questions of war and peace. They have to restudy-and I say this with good reason- even their principles regarding just and unjust wars. What might earlier have seemed  to a great extent  to be just wars should today be eliminated.32.	This acclimatization to new conditions is not an easy matter  nor can it be done very rapidly. But history goes on  and those who belong in the junk heap will be carried there by the tide of history. I now quote from a poet of Hungary's revolutionary past who expressed death and the coming of the new generation in an image of the decay and the revival of nature in the spring: ""... we are pushed  as the tree's young leaves push off the leaves of yesteryear.""33.	Yes  after tremendous historical catastrophes-and at the price of the wonderful sacrifices they entailed for man-a new epoch of mankind is being shaped today under comparatively easy circumstances. In a period of historic changes and changes in social systems  one can observe today a considerable relaxation and  because of an awareness of joint responsibilities  considerable co-operation in the relationship between the principal opposing forces  primarily between those on which the question of whether or not there will be a thermonuclear war depends. This relaxation  however  is not perceived and felt by all.34.	I wish now to examine  in their international context  those areas where the effect of relaxation cannot as yet be perceived.35.	The two VietNamese parties to the Paris talks on the question of Viet-Nam-the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and  together with Madame Binh  the representatives of the national liberation movement do not feel  because they cannot feel  the improvement in international relations. Still less is this improvement felt by the families of the victims lying in blood and dirt in North and South Viet-Nam in the wake of the wanton ravages of bombing raids. In characterizing the situation by means of a literary quotation  I do not at all intend to mitigate the gravity of this tragedy which is practically unprecedented in the history of South-East Asia. On the contrary  I should like to point out the historical depth of the tragedy.36.	In the middle of the last century  in the very  very dark years of Hungarian history there were many such years back in the past and also recently the author Imre Madach  who might be said to have been the offspring of both the Slovak and the Hungarian peoples  in his drama entitled ""The Tragedy of Man"" outlined the past and future of mankind  which he brought to the surface out of the severe sufferings of his private life. This dramatic series of world historical scenes describes  besides the paradise of the first human couple  Athens  Rome and many other things  as well as the construction of the pyramids in ancient Egypt  where a slave dies. In this scene someone tries to console the slave's wife for her loss  saying that it means just one suffering man less. Thereupon the wife replies in these words:""A mere number to you  to me the whole world.""Alas  beloved  who will love me now? ""With this literary quotation I have wished to bring here  into the hall of the United Nations General Assembly  those untold human sufferings which are virtually increasing in some parts of the globe in spite of the fact that we have very serious reasons to talk of improvement in international relations.37.	The general improvement of the international situation does not yet make itself felt in the Viet-Nam question  although the VietNamese side has sketched  with the largest possible measure of political realism  the outlines of an end to the war  a suitable international agreement  and the future of both North and South Viet-Nam. No one can doubt that this is the way of the future. There is no other way. It was a miscalculation in 1964 to devise the Tonkin Bay incident. It was a miscalculation in 1965 to start bombing North Viet-Nam. It was the proper thing in December 1965 to suspend the bombing attacks. It was a miscalculation again to resume bombing in 1966. It was a miscalculation to dispatch a United States armed force of more than 700 000 men to Viet-Nam. It was a miscalculation  while reducing the numerical strength of military personnel  to step up the attacks of mechanized warfare. Eventually there will be practically no one in the whole world who will know what business the United States of America has at all to be in Viet-Nam. One has an impression that even those who send American boys to Viet-Nam do not know that either.38.	In Viet-Nam it is thus impossible to perceive that the international situation is improving. Time  however  is on the side of those who want the effects of the prevailing conditions of international life to be felt also in the VietNamese question.39.	The Hungarian people and their Government support those constructive proposals  which give a sketch of a new  peaceful future of the Far East as a whole  and which have been set forth by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam  together with the liberation movement. We can be sure that these proposals provide the realistic core of a solution to the problems. They have been drawn up by men who live there among the people and who do not seek to let the people suffer from the war and its consequences as long as possible  but who want the people to enjoy the blessings of peace as soon as possible. The main requirement raised in those proposals is in fact the removal of a single man with a small group. What the sons of the American nation are. dying for in Viet-Nam is actually the monomania of a single man  Thieu.40.	The improvement of international relations is imperceptible not only in Viet-Nam  but in the Middle East as well. It is difficult to convince the peoples of the Arab countries that international relations are improving. For five years now those peoples have been waiting for something to be done on the strength of the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council in November 1967  resolution 242(1967). Some interested Powers argue that there is an essential difference between the English and French texts of that resolution. This difference really exists  but it is not this that enhances the world-wide historical importance of the problem but rather the need to secure the conditions of peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Middle East.41.	The Government of Israel would make a real contribution to the continued improvement of the international situation if it could take into consideration two facts: one of them concerns the historic aspects of the issue; the other bears a relation to international law.42.	After the end of the Second World War the progressive forces of the world here in the United Nations also came out in favor of the restoration to their homeland of the dispersed people of Israel because they hoped to do something good for the future of the peoples. In the years of the preparatory and initial stages of the Second World War  fascism  anti-Semitism  racial hatred  the German Ubermensch notion  and Ausradierung (the radical extermination of the Jewish people) became  as it were  the most sternly dominant factors in Europe. Never in the history of mankind have people been killed in such a concentrated manner  in such large numbers and in relatively so short a time as during the era of fascism in Europe. The Soviet Union-which many charge with anti-Semitism today was the decisive factor that made it possible to crush the Fascist Powers  which had sought the complete destruction of Jewry. Had it not been for the Soviet Union  it would not have been possible to defeat Hitlerite Germany.43.	This year the Soviet Union celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of its existence. This is one of the most significant anniversaries in modern history. We are glad that this event occurs at a time when the biggest Power of the other hemisphere has joined in working out the conditions of peaceful coexistence between the two thermonuclear Powers.44.	I have digressed from the Middle East question  but only apparently. It is not without reason that many see precisely in the problems of the Middle East region the danger of a new world war  a thermonuclear war. The further trend of the situation in the Middle East will largely depend on relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.45.	The Government of Israel would therefore do a great service to the favorable development of international life if it could take into account the fact that progressive mankind brought into existence or restored the State of Israel in the hope that a progressive  peaceful and happy enclave of humanity would emerge in the restored homeland of the persecuted Jews. Instead of this  a policy of imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and racial hatred manifests itself in all that Israeli Governments have done since the establishment of the State of Israel. We  the Hungarian Government  are very much interested in the fate of Israel. Many Hungarian Jewish families  persecuted at the time  have since sought new homes in the ""Promised Land"". They have a large number of relatives living in Hungary today. These people are also adversely affected by the pursuit by the ruling quarters of Israel of their anti-Arab policy of aggression.46.	In the light of these historic facts  the Israeli Government could do much to promote the favorable development of international relations if it took seriously into consideration Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations Charter is the principal source of international law today. In pursuance of Article 51 of the Charter  if a Member State victim of armed attack does not receive sufficient effective assistance from the United Nations Security Council  that State has an unrestricted right to resort to any means  including the use of armed force  to repulse the aggression. Since Israel is unwilling to comply with Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  the Arab countries victims of aggression have full authority under international law to reoccupy by armed force the territories occupied by the aggressor.47.	These two factors-the historical one and the one based on international law-can for a short time be ignored by the Government of Israel  which feigns to be deaf and blind to them  but by so doing it undermines the very existence of the State of Israel.48.	With profound responsibility towards the future of the people of Israel one can state the following. The Government of Israel has before it proposals from Arab countries that can place the national security of Israel beyond question; if  however  the Government of Israel cannot take these proposals in all seriousness-proposals which are founded on the Security Council resolution-then it will dig the grave of Israel. At home in Hungary we often speak about the role of short-sighted men in politics. With regard to Israel it can be said that in the short-term time might favour the Israeli leaders stricken with short-sightedness  but in the historical perspective those persons will bury the country of Israel for good. The hard facts of history provide examples of how some nations disappeared from the historical scene in consequence of vicious acts by irresponsible leaders. If Israel's leaders of today imagine that  owing to their specific geographical position  the international influence of Zionism that is spread all over the world can make their present attitude realistic  they are tragically mistaken.49.	I apologize for having dwelled so long upon this: matter  but the question is one of the most instructive issues not only for the present generation but also  I might say  for the history of all mankind. If the Government of Israel does not draw a lesson from the historic and legal factors  it will inevitably dig the grave of its own country and people. Over the short-term some representatives of the Israeli Government might feel that time is on their side  but they ought to know that the future of Israel hinges on whether or not it will be able to settle the problem of its relations with surrounding Arab countries. It would be an illusion for the Government of Israel to seek to build the future of its country upon international Zionism. There is only one solid and sure foundation on which to build the future of Israel: friendship with the neighboring countries  together with recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.50.	I hope members will not mind my long discussion about the problems of the Middle East  but there is a very serious reason for it. Many people are convinced that the potential source of a new world war is to be found not in Viet-Nam but in the Middle East. A few European Governments  for example  the Government of Austria  back the proposal that the problems of the Middle East and the Mediterranean area should also be placed on the agenda of the prospective European conference on security and co-operation. In addition to all this  in dealing so thoroughly with the Middle East questions  I am prompted also by the fact the the effect of the general improvement of the international situation can be perceived least of all in that region. It is a common international duty of all States Members of the United Nations  an obligation under the Charter  to work out a concrete plan for the peaceful settlement of relations in the Middle East. The Hungarian Government views the efforts of Ambassador Jarring with deep respect and tries not only with good wishes but also with concrete steps to help him to fulfill his historic mission.51.	The large majority of the States Members of the United Nations are countries of what is called the third world. In Georgetown earlier this year their representatives addressed a strong appeal to other countries of the world  asking for their assistance in solving the economic problems of the developing nations.  While we talk here-and with good reason about improvement in international relations  poverty is increasing in large parts of Asia  Africa and Latin America. The peoples of the world have to take concerted action to eliminate the last vestiges of colonialism  to liberate the peoples still living under colonial oppression and  at the same time  to help the countries liberated from colonial domination to overcome their economic difficulties.52.	An important event in the history of the United Nations was the settlement of the question of Chinese representation. The Government of Hungary was pleased to receive the news of events which indicated the lessening of the international isolation of the People's Republic of China and its active participation in world affairs. The settlement of relations between Japan and China is also an event of great importance in international life. It is worth quoting the poem which the Japanese Prime Minister wrote on the historic occasion when  as representative of the Japan of modern history  he was recently on an official visit in the China of the world socialist system. That poem reads as follows:""Japan and China broke their relations many years ago ""But now the time has come to resume these links.""Autumn is approaching.""Our neighbors welcome us with warmth in their eyes.""The Peking sky is clear  and the autumn air is deep.""That verse is certainly more graceful in Japanese and Chinese than in English or Hungarian. But that is not the point. What is important is that representatives of two great nations have met. Of course it is clear to me that China's rejoining international life could have taken place under more auspicious circumstances. The main reason for the present less auspicious circumstances is that during 22 years the prevalent tendency in this Organization was to boycott the People's Republic of China. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is glad that this issue facing the United Nations has now been solved.53.	Besides the solution of this issue  much more visible signs of the improvement of the international situation can be discerned in Europe. I know that the name of Europe does not have a pleasant ring to the vast majority of Member States. That name is linked with the barbarous centuries of colonialism and the tragedies of two world wars. But now  at the dawn of a new epoch for mankind  when today's generation is preparing to live in the thermonuclear age  Europe is trying to enforce the policy of peaceful coexistence instead of the alternative of the dreadful cataclysm of thermonuclear war.54.	It is a good thing that at precisely this time both the President of the General Assembly and our Secretary- General are representatives of European countries. I wish to offer both of them my congratulations in this context. The Foreign Minister of Poland  in his statement here in the general debate [2042nd meeting]  referred to the tragic past of his country  to the centuries during which Poland had been practically non-existent in terms of international law. Today the Polish people live in the finest period of their history and  thanks to their considerable achievements  have become one of the most active factors of European peace and security and of international cooperation.55.	A very lovely manifestation of the hopes entertained in Europe with regard to the Polish people is a nursery rhyme which two great promoters of the interdependence of the peoples of Central Europe  the two Hungarian composers Zoltan Kodaly and Bela Bartok  discovered at a time  in the early years of the century  when from the legal point of view Poland did not even exist in reality. This nursery rhyme can be rendered into English as follows:""Little duckling bathing in the big black pond""Is about to visit mother in Poland.""Today not only Poland but the other European countries along with it can live in peace and security.56.	It is this peace and security that we wish to place on more solid foundations than heretofore. That is why we wish to convene a conference on European security and co-operation. This is not merely an affair of Europe. If we put it through properly  it will benefit also other peoples of the world  since the immeasurable resources to be released by the termination of the arms race can then be used to solve fundamental problems concerning the life of mankind.57.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic looks to the future with good hope. We think the United Nations has been and will be an expedient engineer of this future. I compliment our new Secretary-General in expressing that belief. Recently the mayors of the European capitals held a meeting in Budapest. On that occasion the Burgomaster of Vienna presented the text of a joint statement. This is the mark of a new stage in the relations between Budapest and Vienna. Secretary-General Waldheim  both as former Ambassador of Austria and as a former Foreign Minister of his country  has had an important share in improving the relations between States in Central Europe. Also on behalf of the Hungarian people and Government we ask him to use the goodwill with which he has promoted friendship between our two peoples in order to contribute on a global scale to strengthening the mutual understanding and security of the peoples of the world.58.	When we think of the future of the United Nations  we cannot forget its past either. After the First World War the League of Nations came into being  but was dissolved amid the events following the outbreak of the Second World War. The United Nations was established after the end of the Second World War. Its founders drew a lesson from the experiences of the two World Wars. Nevertheless  this Organization has often found itself in a state of crisis during the past few years. Among the many factors that have saved the existence of this Organization there has been a special  personal factor: die former Secretary-General of the United Nations  UThant. Not only this Organization but the whole of mankind have gone through extremely critical periods in the past years. The wisdom of our former Secretary-General  his responsiveness to human and social problems  his modesty and humility before the great facts of history revealed to us the impressive greatness of his calling in the world and helped many of us to discharge the accumulating tasks confronting the United Nations.59.	I express the wish that ills sense of responsibility will prevail in this Organization."
"52",3134,"IDN",27,1972,"Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of my delegation  to associate myself with previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My delegation is convinced that with your wisdom and vast experience to guide us  this session of the Assembly will be able to cope successfully with the problems with which it is being confronted. I should like to congratulate also the 17 Vice-Presidents on their election. My delegation is certain that their wise counsel will be of utmost benefit to us all in the deliberations upon which we have embarked.70.	My delegation feels flattered by  and grateful for  the laudatory remarks made by delegations in their tributes to your predecessor. It has indeed been an honor for my country to have shared with this Assembly the services of Adam Malik  one of Indonesia's prominent and outstanding citizens.71.	Allow me also to convey to our distinguished Secretary-General Indonesia's congratulations on his assumption of his high and exacting office. The efforts that he has made during the course of this year in the interest of universal peace and security deserve our whole-hearted support and appreciation. On this occasion our warm thoughts and deep gratitude also go to U Thant  our former Secretary-General  a great son of Asia  who occupied the highest executive office of our Organization during a decade of turbulence.72.	Indonesia's view on the issues that confront mankind today cannot be separated from the fact that we are a nation whose cultural heritage is deeply embedded in the South-East Asian region. It is profoundly influenced by events and problems of that region.73.	For Indonesia  situated in an area of the world that continues to suffer under strains of war and human sorrow  the strengthening of international peace and security cannot but be of primary importance. The atmosphere of detente which is now being felt in the international political arena will  we hope  facilitate the further efforts of the big Powers to reduce tensions between them. Indonesia welcomes this detente  which has been accentuated by the meetings between leaders of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  respectively. We consider the agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union as a result of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks as an important step towards disarmament. It represents  however  only a beginning and we recognize that much more remains to be done before we are really on the road to complete disarmament.74.	It must be stressed here that a detente among the big Powers does not automatically bring about conditions of peace and security in all regions of the world. We still witness hotbeds of conflicts persisting in South-East Asia  the Middle East and southern Africa. Another aspect of this phenomenon is the tendency of the great Powers to ignore the small and medium-sized members of the international community and by-pass the United Nations in their search for solutions to world problems. Peace and security  however  should be the concern of all nations  both large and small  and all countries must be encouraged to play an active role in the achievement of these important goals.75.	It was with these considerations in mind that Indonesia voted for resolution 2833 (XXVI)  which recommends the convening of a world disarmament conference open to all States. My delegation believes that careful preparations should precede such a conference.76.	At this juncture  while the concept of a world disarmament conference is still in its embryonic stage  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva remains the only negotiating body under the United Nations umbrella entrusted with the problems of disarmament. The most urgent issue to be solved by a Conference at this stage is an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear- test ban. Pending such an agreement  a moratorium on all nuclear testing is most desirable. Meanwhile  it is to be regretted that  notwithstanding General Assembly resolutions 1910 (XVIII) and 2828 C (XXVI) on nuclear-weapon tests  certain States continue their nuclear-weapon testing.77.	My delegation notes with sorrow and deep regret that the end of bloodshed and suffering in Viet-Nam  in the Khmer Republic and in Laos is not yet in sight. Hundreds of thousands of precious human lives have been extinguished  a much greater number of persons have been maimed  and devastation of indescribable magnitude has ravaged these lands; but the war in Viet-Nam and in the other countries of Indochina  which has lasted for more than one generation  still goes on. Located close to this scene of war  Indonesia yearns for peace in this region. It is for this reason that Indonesia and other countries in South-East Asia have exerted themselves to help find solutions that may end the fighting and establish genuine peace. Our view remains that the future of Viet-Nam  of the Khmer Republic and of Laos should be decided by the peoples themselves without outside interference. Withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territories of the countries concerned is a prerequisite for the return of peace to these war-torn lands. It is important  however  to remind ourselves that the events in VietNam  in the Khmer Republic and in Laos  while closely interrelated  are not entirely similar in origin and character.78.	The situation in the Middle East shows no signs of improvement. Israel's adamant defiance of United Nations resolutions  in particular the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  is the principal cause of the tension in the area  which has been continuously aggravated by Israel's armed incursions and air raids into the neighboring Arab countries. Moreover  Israel's continued illegal occupation of Arab territory and its persistent denial of fundamental human rights to the Palestinians are in direct violation of the United Nations Charter. Expansion of territory by force of arms cannot be condoned. The United Nations must be able to act effectively to ensure implementation by Israel of the relevant resolutions.79.	We also see no progress  in the solution of the problems of Namibia  of Portuguese colonialism or of apartheid and racism in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Indonesia views the task entrusted to the Secretary-General under Security Council resolution 309 (1972) as a new approach which must not be allowed to undermine the legal status which Namibia has attained. The sovereign integrity and unity of Namibia and the Namibian people must remain the basis for any contact between the Secretary-General or his emissary and the racist regime of South Africa.80.	As to the Territories of Africa still under Portuguese colonial domination  it is heartening to note that  for the first time in the history of decolonization  the Special Mission of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples visited the liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau) in April 1972. After having considered the Mission's report [A/8723/Rev.l  chap. X  annex I]  the Special Committee  of which Indonesia has the honor to be a member  passed a resolution recognizing the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde as the only authentic and representative liberation movement in Guinea (Bissau) [ibid.  chap. X  para. 34]. Indonesia recommends strongly that the United Nations increase its assistance to the liberation movements fighting against Portuguese colonial domination.81.	The twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly  in its waning days  saw the flames of war engulfing the South Asian subcontinent. As we begin our twenty-seventh session  those tragic days have become part of history. It is the fervent hope of my delegation that the current negotiations between India and Pakistan  both close friends of Indonesia  will continue to be fruitful. Indonesia has established diplomatic relations with the new nation of Bangladesh. We regret that this new State has been denied membership in the United Nations. Indonesia firmly believes that Bangladesh should be accepted as a Member  as this is in accordance with the Charter and the principle of universality. At the same time we hope that the outstanding issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan  especially the serious matter of the return of prisoners of war to Pakistan  can be expeditiously resolved and the way paved for normal and peaceful relations between those two countries.82.	Indonesia views the current efforts towards rapprochement on the part of the two Koreas as an encouraging development  and hopes that the Korean people in both parts of that divided country will be able to continue to widen the areas of agreement between them. The efforts of the leaders in the north and south deserve all the support that the international community can provide. It is incumbent upon all of us to assist in the creation of an atmosphere conducive to the success of the direct negotiations now going on between the two Governments.83.	The recent tragic incident in Munich resulting in the loss of lives of innocent people is to be regretted. At the same time  Indonesia calls upon the international community not to have a limited perspective concerning these desperate acts committed by desperate people. This tragedy  like other actions in a string of violent events which are occurring on a world-wide scale  must not be viewed as an isolated phenomenon. Rather  it must be considered within the framework of the grave problems which have gripped the Middle East and other areas for so long and for which no solutions have been found. We have to consider the root-causes of those problems and try to solve them. Otherwise  the world community will continue to be plagued by a recurrence of such tragedies. If the General Assembly in this present session is prepared  with a strong sense of urgency  to address itself to the question of so-called international terrorism  we should be no less aware of the urgency in remedying the underlying causes leading to these acts of violence.84.	Indonesia is a nation whose national territory includes more than 13 000 islands. Since more than half of its territory consists of the sea  Indonesia is vitally interested in the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. We hope that the projected conference on the law of the sea will succeed in establishing universally accepted legal concepts and rules governing the exploitation of the natural riches of the sea-bed and ocean floor and other unsettled issues of the law of the sea  taking into consideration the legitimate national interests of coastal States. We are particularly interested in seeing the archipelago concept accepted by the international community  as this concept constitutes a safeguard and a guarantee for the political  economic and social unity of island-nations like Indonesia.85.	The twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly adopted resolution 2832 (XXVI)  which declares the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. As a State bordering the Indian Ocean  Indonesia considers this resolution of signal importance. However  the proper implementation of the resolution requires the existence of mutual trust and understanding among the coastal States. Furthermore  a certain consensus should exist among the coastal States themselves as to what the zone of peace should mean in practice before consultations can be held with outside Powers with a view to observing the terms of the declaration. Such a consensus can only be brought about through negotiations between the parties concerned. This is by no means an easy task  but the collective will of these coastal States will  it is to be hoped  prevent resolution 2832 (XXVI) from becoming a dead letter.86.	Fully realizing the detrimental effects of power politics in many parts of the world including their own region  member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] are very much concerned to keep their region outside the sphere of power rivalries and power conflicts in order to enable them to concentrate their efforts on the betterment of their peoples. It is for this reason that the Philippines  Thailand  Singapore and Indonesia welcomed Malaysia's initiative for the neutralization of South-East Asia. The concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality is embodied in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration.3 My colleague and friend the Chairman of the Malaysian delegation has already dwelt at length on this subject from this rostrum [2039th meeting]  and I can only add that my delegation fully shares his views.87.	The region of South-East Asia has enormous potential for economic growth and development. It is rich in resources and the people are dedicated to the economic and social improvement of their respective nations. It is a region which  through the centuries  has attracted traders from many parts of the world and was subsequently colonized by Western empires. Now that it has freed itself from colonial domination  it finds itself becoming a focal point in the international power game. It is therefore not by accident that these countries of South-East Asia  which are at the early states of economic development  have felt the need for regional co-operation.88.	ASEAN has already proved a useful instrument for enhancing mutual assistance and co-operation in the economic and cultural fields. It has also become increasingly important as a framework for the protection of regional economic interests in relation to other economic communities.89.	One of the intangible but no less important results is that ASEAN has created a certain measure of common identity and a feeling of unity among its members. They firmly believe that this co-operation within ASEAN will promote the stability of their region  which in turn will contribute to the consolidation of world peace and security. Our regional efforts should therefore be seen as an integral part of global endeavors to create a better world for man.90.	Regional stability  however  can be effectively developed only if each component part develops its own national resilience. The strengthening of national resilience  which is the over-all capability to resist outside negative influences and pressures on the basis of political stability and economic well-being  together with an increasing sense of unity and common identity  will likewise enhance the resilience of the region as a whole.91.	I believe that none of us will disagree with the view that the world economy does not develop in favor of the developing countries. Based on preliminary data  the rate of growth of those countries in 1971 was below the target rate of the Second United Nations Development Decade.3 Declaration issued by the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  held at Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971.92.	Although the recent economic performance of a number of these countries appeared to be satisfactory  the fact remains that most of them are lagging behind on the road to progress. Their relative position in world trade continues to worsen because of the chronic unfavorable development of their terms of trade and because of lagging exports  caused in part by the growing difficulties faced by their traditional exports with regard to access to the markets of the developed countries.93.	Furthermore  the international monetary situation is such that an atmosphere of uncertainty prevails among the developing countries with regard to their foreign exchange reserves as well as their prospective export earnings. Its negative effects on economic development are further amplified by the reduction in development assistance. Several developed countries have failed to make progress towards achieving the 1 per cent target of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  while the average terms and conditions of their aid have hardened. The developing countries face the danger of a reversal in the net flow of capital from the developing to the developed countries as a result of debt servicing  capital repatriation and profit transfer.94.	It is unfortunate that the third session of UNCTAD ended with only inconclusive results and failed to contribute concretely to the solution of the fundamental problems confronting the developing countries.95.	These developments are running counter to the commitments jointly undertaken by all nations under the International Development Strategy. They make evident the urgent need for substantial reform and innovation. In this connexion it might be useful to recall the statement made by Mr. McNamara  President of the World Bank  at that session   in which he expressed his deep concern about the unacceptable state of development in most of the developing countries and emphasized the urgent need for moving forward with practical measures.96.	Those and some other problems relating to development are now on the agenda of our current session. I trust that  if the political will exists  especially with the rich countries represented here  the General Assembly can make a positive contribution towards practical solutions.97.	The developing countries have made it clear that in the endeavor to find solutions to economic problems in which their very interests are at stake  they want to be full participants and active partners. First and foremost is the problem of international monetary reform  for which an urgent solution is required. Of equal importance are the 1972 multilateral trade negotiations  which must not be conducted along the traditional lines of negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but should comprise all aspects which are identified as barriers to trade. Special ground rules  modalities and techniques for the participation of developing countries should be worked out to ensure that these countries will really benefit from the results.98.	With regard to development assistance  my delegation joins its voice with those of other delegations in appealing to developed countries to adhere to the targets set out in the International Development Strategy.99.	While I am on the subject of international aid  allow me to say a few words regarding the activities of the United Nations in the operational field  namely that of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP]  since we consider it one of the most successful and rewarding enterprises in the international joint endeavor  which has already done a great deal for the cause of the developing countries. Indonesia is one of the countries that has benefited from UNDP's activities  especially after the approval of its program for the first cycle by the UNDP Governing Council at its fourteenth session. Indonesia is most appreciative of this fact  and would like to express its hope and confidence that a more dynamic growth in the over-all resources could be made available so as to enable the program to grow substantially in the subsequent cycles.100.	Another example of a successful joint endeavor was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  which has contributed considerably to making man more aware of the serious threat that exists to his total environment on earth. The Conference has provided us with valuable recommendations as to how man can begin to correct the destruction which he himself has wrought upon the ecology of the earth. My delegation would like to stress that  in the formulation of international action concerning environmental problems  the needs of the developing countries should be given adequate consideration.101.	Turning now to the national economy  I am happy to state that there is manifestly an expansion of economic activities in Indonesia-not only in the agricultural sector  which still has priority in our development policy  but also in the industrial sector  especially in the extractive industries.102.	In spite of a definite shift from a deficit to a surplus in the routine budget  thus enabling the Government to release more domestic resources for investment  the development budget still has a heavy foreign component derived from bilateral as well as multilateral assistance. At the same time  the Government encourages foreign investment to participate in the development efforts  and it can be said that so far there is a satisfactory influx of investment capital in Indonesia.103.	The decreasing demand in many industrialized countries for our major primary commodities  along with the resultant drop in prices  on the one hand  and the higher cost of importing capital goods  on the other  may well result in negative balances of payments  jeopardizing our development efforts. Indonesia feels that a wider access to the markets of the developed countries for our export commodities through the elimination or progressive reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers is an indispensable requirement for our development effort.104.	Another negative trend discernible in the past two years has been the diminishing willingness to transfer capital to less-developed countries.105.	The development process in Indonesia has reached a point at which a larger economic basis has already been created as a launching pad for a subsequent development undertaking on a bigger scale  which in turn requires larger amounts of financing. Such financing could not be covered by domestic resources alone  but has to be increasingly supplemented with outside financial assistance.106.	My delegation would like to stress that external aid and participation in Indonesia's economic development can be accepted only on the basis of ""no strings attached""  in order not to limit our freedom of decision in accordance with our independent and active foreign policy.107.	We who are firm believers in the United Nations cannot fail to note the growing lack of confidence in the United Nations and its institutions  especially among youth.108.	The important role of youth today in world affairs was duly recognized by this Assembly last year when it resolved that a mural should be painted at United Nations Headquarters to commemorate the World Youth Assembly [resolution 2896 (XXVI)]. It is to youth that we shall pass on the United Nations its successes as well as its failures- and they are the ones who will carry on our work in saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It is imperative that we restore their confidence in the United Nations-firstly  by ensuring through performance and achievements that the Organization really stands for the lofty principles and purposes of the Charter  and  secondly  by interesting them and including them in the work of our Organization  which the Secretary general so aptly described as the most profitable long-term investment ever made in human history.109.	It would be appropriate for my delegation to recall in this connexion the statement made by Mr. Adam Malik in his inaugural address as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly:""We must realize that  unless the United Nations makes sense and is meaningful to the youth of today  the Organization is doomed to atrophy or irrelevance.""... for all the confusion and contradictions that mark their emergence  these younger generations are the carriers of a new idealism; they are the vehicles of... global human solidarity  cutting across national boundaries. ...""We have to harness their idealism and give it concrete international purpose by relating it to the accumulated experience and knowledge within the United Nations"". [1934th meeting  paras. 53-59.]110. In conclusion I should like to assure the Assembly of the readiness of the Indonesian delegation to co-operate fully in an objective and realistic manner  with you  Mr. President  with all delegations represented here and with the Secretary-General in our quest for solutions to the problems and issues confronting the United Nations."
"53",3181,"IND",27,1972,"Mr. President  I offer you on behalf of India our most cordial congratulations on your election as the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. By electing you  the Member States have recognized your own skill and wisdom and have also honored the struggles and achievements of the Polish people. India has had close and friendly relations with Poland  and I wish to assure you of our fullest co-operation as you discharge your responsibilities.47.	I should also like to pay a tribute to our outgoing President  Adam Malik  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  for the patience and devotion with which he guided our work during the last session.48.	We recall the long years of dedicated service which U Thant gave to the United Nations arid for which he will always be remembered with affection and admiration. At the same time  we greet our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim. His dynamism and his high sense of purpose had been recognized even before his election at the end of our last session. Since then his tireless efforts in the exercise of his duties have earned him high respect. We wish him continued success.49.	In India  we are celebrating this year the twenty-fifth anniversary of our independence. As a result of the long struggle of our people  we became independent in the year 1947. In the years that followed  the freedom of most countries from colonial domination was achieved and a community of interest in justice and progress began to grown among the newly independent countries. In the quarter of a century that has since passed  we have had our share of difficulties and successes. Today we are more united and determined than we have ever been before in the last 25 years. Our faith in our democracy has become deeper  our goals for the betterment of our people are clearer  and our resolution to achieve them has become firmer. We realize that basically we must rely on our own values and resources in order to strengthen our economy and to accelerate the pace of our development. The bulk of the burden must fall on us as indeed it has fallen on us in the past. At the same time we believe that international co-operation is vitally necessary if humanity as a whole is to be freed from poverty and want. Our unfinished revolution in India will not be completed until full economic and social justice is assured for all our people. In this spirit  we seek nothing but co-operation and friendship with all  on a basis of equality.50.	India adheres firmly to the policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. This does not  and cannot  mean an exact middle position between any two extreme views on matters of international concern. India's policy of non-alignment is based on the need in the modern world to maximize the area of peace  reduce tension and ensure stability with justice. We believe in the sovereign parity of all nations; we accept the supremacy of none. Our friendship is open to all countries on the same terms. We trust in co-operation among equals  not in co-operation on the basis of domination by one country over another. This policy determines our attitude to all countries  and will continue to govern our relationship with our neighbors.51.	The last year has been marked by significant detente among nations  big and small. The meetings of leaders in Moscow and Peking  the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States  especially on the limitation of strategic arms  are helpful changes from the earlier and sterile  and at times dangerous  confrontations. In Europe many prospects for the reduction of tensions have opened up. Some of the recent events in Asia encourage the hope that our part of the world might also soon be moving towards greater understanding and co-operation. Our purpose in this improving situation will be to ensure that the momentum towards an ever-expanding area of understanding and accommodation is maintained.52.	The world at large is rejecting more and more the concepts of spheres of influence  under the guise of balance of power and of domination of smaller Powers by the mightier ones. In this context the Secretary-General has noted in his thoughtful introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Af8701jAdd. 1]  that the idea of keeping peace and security through a concert of great Powers is outdated  if not outmoded. The current processes of detente can produce healthy and abiding results only when they do not ignore the interests of countries that are yet to participate in them. Non-aligned countries have long striven for such contacts and consultations as are now in fact taking place. At the same time they have repeatedly emphasized the risks to true independence if agreements are not concluded by broad-based consultations.53.	A recent encouraging development has been the greater and more determined pursuit of bilateralism in the search for solutions to many international problems. In the past there were many instances when the interests of outside Powers prevented the settlement of problems which could have been achieved by mutual consultations among the parties directly concerned. Examples of this kind are not altogether absent in our time. Nevertheless  in areas as widely separated as Central Europe  North Africa  West Africa and Asia  agreements have been reached for solving a number of problems through the efforts of the countries directly concerned. The settlement of problems mutually and bilaterally can  we think  strengthen peace  security and independence.54.	Looked at from this point of view  the recent developments in the relations between India and Pakistan mark a significant departure from past years  when hostility and suspicion were unfortunately the dominant features. Direct negotiations have provided a more dependable means by which we can settle and solve our problems to the benefit of the vast population of the region. In a sincere search for a durable peace and good-neighbourly relations  we opened negotiations with Pakistan last February which culminated in the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972. The two Governments have agreed that all problems between them should be settled by peaceful means through mutual consultations.55.	The President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India have pledged full support and expressed their complete determination for the faithful implementation of the Simla Agreement. For this purpose  further accords are to be arrived at by mutual consultation and discussion. The use of force has been totally abjured. They have also agreed that in Jammu and Kashmir the entire line of control as it existed at the time of ceasefire on 17 December 1971 will be respected by both sides. The two Governments have been taking steps to carry out this agreement and when some doubts and difficulties arose a few weeks ago  these too were resolved by direct negotiations. The military commanders have been meeting from time to time to work out the delineation of the line of control. Agreement on delineation has been arrived at practically everywhere except for a few small pockets where the total area involved is only a few square miles. We have offered to the Pakistan side to have joint inspection and survey  wherever necessary  in order to complete the delineation. We hope that the military commanders of the two sides will meet without any further delay to finalize delineation in the remaining small pockets by holding joint meetings  joint inspections and surveys whenever necessary. We hope that very shortly the entire line will be delineated. The completion of this task will  as already agreed  be followed by mutual withdrawal of troops. In the meantime  exchanges have been taking place of sick and wounded prisoners of war and of those civilians who came to be under the custody of India or Pakistan at the outbreak of hostilities on the western sector.56.	There are naturally several problems arising out of the armed conflict  and the two Governments have agreed that these problems  as also other basic unresolved matters between the two countries  would be settled by mutual agreement. A series of meetings at various levels is envisaged to achieve this objective. The welcome accorded to the Simla Agreement by the international community will sustain the efforts of the two Governments and their leaders to work patiently towards a durable peace.57.	The Simla Agreement is the first major fruitful step in the search for mutual understanding and co-operation between India and Pakistan. Its full and effective application should bring about conditions in both countries which will enable their peoples to utilize their resources and energies for the pressing task of advancing their welfare. The peoples of India and Pakistan have many common interests and aspirations and they would wish to live as good neighbors. The Simla Agreement has therefore been widely supported by the people of both the countries.58.	The emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country is destined to be of vital importance in strengthening peace  stability  security and progress in the subcontinent. We welcome Bangladesh as an equal partner in this common task of the countries of the region. The heroism and fortitude of the people of Bangladesh will be an invaluable asset in the reconstruction of their country.59.	We deeply regret that Bangladesh was not enabled to take its place at the opening of this session of the General Assembly. A country with 75 million people  it has been recognized by over 90 other sovereign States and has already found its rightful place in many international forums. The earliest admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations will further strengthen the United Nations system  will reinforce the principle of universality of our Organization  and will contribute to the more expeditious normalization of relations among the countries of the subcontinent and the achievement of peace and harmony in the area. We are convinced that this General Assembly can do much to bring this about  through reconsideration of Bangladesh's application by the Security Council.60.	We sincerely hope that  in the shortest possible time  Pakistan and Bangladesh will be able to solve all the problems between them with understanding and as equal sovereign States.61.	We view with deep satisfaction the fact that India's relations with other neighboring countries continue to grow in depth and so serve to help strengthen the forces of peace and progress in South Asia. The relations between China and India have not shown the necessary and expected improvement. On our part  we continue to be ready  as indeed we have indicated in the past  to resume normal relations with China and to improve them in our mutual interest and with mutual respect. Against the background of the normalization and detente that have taken place in Asia and in other parts of the world such an improvement in Sino-Indian relations is  in our opinion  all the more desirable.62.	Naturally  I have taken a few minutes to explain at some length the significant developments on the Indian subcontinent  the state of our relations with some of our immediate neighbors  and the hopes for peace and progress they inspire. These issues are nearest to us. I must now deal briefly with some other vital international problems.63.	The presence in this hall of 132 States should make us doubly conscious of the absence of representatives of many large areas of the world which are still under colonial rule. Nor can we ignore the fact that in several countries rampant racism is being preached and practiced. The solution of these problems will require a degree of awareness and co-operation which are unfortunately still lacking. The Indian delegation will do its utmost to work out  together with the others  all such practical means as the United Nations can pursue. We shall continue to support the struggle for independence being carried out by the people of all colonial Territories  including Namibia  Zimbabwe  Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). We will not relax our efforts to eliminate racial discrimination  whenever and wherever it appears. The meetings of the Security Council last winter at Addis Ababa provided an opportunity for focusing attention on these problems. We look forward with interest to the outcome of the Secretary-General's efforts with regard to Namibia and to the more effective use of the Commissioner and the Council for Namibia.64.	The situation that has now arisen in Uganda cannot but cause concern to all of us. The problems facing the Asians affected by the expulsion order are essentially humanitarian in character and can be solved only in a spirit of compassion and understanding. The people facing deportation should be afforded reasonable time to be able to wind up their affairs in an orderly manner and depart in safety. A vast majority of them have lived there for generations and they should be allowed to take with them their personal belongings and a reasonable amount of assets to enable them to restart their lives in other lands with some measure of hope and confidence. We hope that the Government of Uganda will respect these human considerations and do everything possible to discharge its responsibility towards the person and property of these unfortunate people and so lessen their hardship. Any help other countries can give in overcoming this problem will  of course  be most welcome; India  for its part  is doing all it can.65.	We must ensure that our solidarity in the common struggle against racial discrimination and colonial domination is not undermined. Since we all agree that racial discrimination is an evil to be fought  we  all of us  cannot but oppose it  whatever form it may take.66.	Tensions and frustrations continue to mount in the Middle East and indeed  as recent incidents have shown  are rising to unprecedented heights of senseless and savage reprisals and terror. The efforts of Ambassador Jarring and of our Secretary-General have not yet borne fruit and meanwhile Israel is persistently consolidating its position to the total detriment of Arab and Palestinian rights and interests. Israel has consistently obstructed all attempts at progress towards a peaceful solution of this problem as laid down in Security Council resolution 242(1967) and has created the situation  where threats to international peace and security are increasing daily and at times ominously. We would also ask why the permanent members of the Security Council have for months failed to meet in the face of this deteriorating situation and this grave problem.67.	India stands firmly against interference by outside Powers aimed at preventing any people from determining its destiny or choosing its form of government in accordance with its own wishes. The tragedy in Viet-Nam is the prolonged denial  in the most brutal manner  of this basic right of the people. We cannot but strongly deplore and express dismay at the continued and ever-increasing bombardment and aerial bombing of innocent men  women and children  their cities  villages and homes  and the indiscriminate destruction of ports  industries  crops  forests and all other means of existence. We have consistently held and expressed the view for a long time that force and foreign military intervention cannot bring this problem to an end. This view is shared by a large and ever-increasing number of countries. Recent indications are that the United States of America has also come to accept this view. We believe that the seven-point proposal put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam provides a reasonable basis for peaceful negotiations. The continuance of bombing with savage intensity in Indochina in these circumstances must command our utmost opposition.68.	We regret the attitude of non-cooperation by Saigon  which holds out little hope of progress towards a peaceful settlement of this problem. The independence  integrity and non-alignment of the three States of Indochina are vital to the peace and progress of Asia. The Geneva accords  provided the framework within which these objectives could be achieved. The decision of the Saigon Government to refuse a visa to the Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in VietNam is in clear violation of its obligations.69.	We are disappointed that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has not been able to finalize even limited measures during the past year's deliberations. Bearing in mind the link between the strengthening of international security  disarmament and economic development  we expect that the objectives of cessation and reversal of the arms race  especially in nuclear armaments  the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control will be vigorously pursued. Our general views supporting the convening of a world disarmament conference  after adequate preparation and with the participation of all States  have been made known and we look forward to a constructive debate during this session.70.	On the question of the strengthening of international security and related subjects  we are confident that our discussions will enable us to give effect  in a more practical and fruitful manner  to the ideas embodied in the Declaration itself [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  with such further elaboration as may be necessary.71.	The adoption of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  is a welcome follow-up of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. The creation of zones of peace and co-operation  free from great-Power military rivalries and interventions  and the removal of bases conceived in that context  must be seen as part of legitimate regional efforts towards strengthening international security. My delegation would support the taking of further steps to give fuller meaning and substance to the Declaration and would co-operate with other delegations for this purpose.72.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm last June  has awakened hopes and fears at the same time. The prevention of pollution is a matter of common concern to the entire human race. But the developing countries cannot accept any line of reasoning which makes the prevention of pollution an excuse for slowing down growth in the poorer countries.73.	Addressing the Conference  the Prime Minister of India pointed out that ""Environment cannot be improved in conditions of poverty. Nor can poverty be eradicated without use of science and technology.""74.	To the bulk of the human population poverty continues to be a much bigger menace than pollution. The true lesson of the Stockholm Conference is that we must start the quest for a world without poverty and without pollution. We consider that the program should be formulated on a world-wide basis in order to assist countries to meet effectively the requirements of the growth of human settlements and to improve the quality of life in existing settlements by creating a human settlement development fund.75.	The peaceful uses of the sea-bed and the utilization of "" the vast and as yet untapped resources of the sea-bed in the interests of mankind remain a matter of importance to us. We cautiously hope that the preparatory work entrusted to the United Nations Committee on the sea-bed  will result in the early convening of a conference on the law of the sea.76.	Recent developments in the world economy and in the monetary field have caused grave concern to us all and have pointed to the need for the establishing of a more durable and equitable world monetary system. Let us not forget that the world economy will not be restored to health by focusing only on the payments problems of the prosperous countries. Monetary  trade and development problems are all closely interrelated and the developing countries have a vital stake in all of them. The developing countries must therefore participate fully in any decision-making process affecting the future of the international monetary system  so that their legitimate interests may be fully safeguarded.77.	Last week the International Monetary Fund at its annual meeting  showed some awareness of the problem by setting up a committee of Governors in which the developing countries have increased representation. We consider that the link between the special drawing rights and additional development finance  which we have always advocated and the need for which has now been widely realized  should be established soon.78.	India participated  with great expectations  in the third session of UNCTAD  held in Santiago earlier this year.The need for taking speedy follow-up action on the decisions taken at that conference cannot be over-emphasized. It may be too early to attempt a final evaluation of the results of the conference  but clearly many trade and allied issues of great concern to the developing countries have remained unresolved. Continued efforts from all sides are therefore necessary if the high hopes that were entertained in respect of that conference are to be realized.79.	Two years ago my delegation had occasion to emphasize the great importance of the adoption by the General Assembly of an International Development Strategy for the 1970s. It cannot  however  be said with any degree of confidence that the commitments voluntarily assumed by the international community only a short time ago are being implemented with any vigor and vitality. If anything  there has been a slide-back in the fulfillment of the goals and objectives of the Decade  and the interests of the developing countries have been given only residual consideration. During the remaining years of this decade  therefore  it will be necessary for all of us to catch up with the time loss and to evolve effective and concrete pro-grammes of international co-operation in the economic field.80.	At the same time  the continuous and well-coordinated review and appraisal of the implementation of the Development Strategy will need to be equally emphasized. We hope that the two newly established committees of the Economic and Social Council  the Committee on Review and Appraisal and the Committee on Science and Technology for Development  will be able to make an effective contribution in this field  in close co-ordination with the useful work already being done by UNCTAD and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDOJ.81.	Our agenda has nearly a hundred items on it  and I have commented on only a limited number of issues. However  we are conscious that many other problems  whether or not they are included in our agenda  create anxieties and difficulties in many parts of the world. The Secretary-General  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701lAdd.l]  has given his views on salient aspects of the international scene as it is today  and on the perspective for the future.82.	In order to complete my presentation I should like to touch upon the Indian experience over the last year or so.83.	As I said here 12 months ago [1940th meeting]  the year 1971 opened for us with great hopes and yet throughout the year we faced endless  and at times nearly insurmountable  difficulties. Confronted with the most appalling difficulties and human tragedies  the Indian people showed remarkable unity and determination. Within three months of the cease-fire nearly ail of the 10 million refugees had gone back to their homes in newly independent Bangladesh. Despite our limited resources we have co-operated fully with Bangladesh in the Herculean task of relief and reconstruction.84.	The Indian people are now engaged in increasing their agricultural and industrial production. The Government of India has introduced programs in order to achieve greater social justice and more satisfying human values for the Indian people as a whole. In that great experiment the Government and people of India look to the United Nations as a continuous source of inspiration and a vast field of co-operation.85.	Yet our Organization is constantly being enfeebled  if not undermined  in a number of ways. Some seek in it partisan support; others make an issue of money and finance; still others try to use it to underwrite their domestic policies. All of these may appear to some to be legitimate  but developing countries such as India look upon this Organization as a bastion where international peace and justice can be protected and where progress can be assured. For that purpose the great principles of the Charter cannot be pursued selectively: they should be taken in their totality  and applied realistically in a given situation. U Thant has already drawn attention to this problem  and we are anxious that in the coming years it should be possible to work out a viable system in which the seeming contradiction in Charter principles would no longer prove to be a hindrance to solving several international problems of our time.86.	Such a step  taken together with the more massive and co-operative utilization of modern science and technology  may well fulfill the dream for which this Organization was established. There is a need for vigilance and study to decide how we can make our Organization more representative  more effective and more responsive to the multitude of needs of people all over the world.87.	Finally  I would simply say that in spite of many setbacks and disappointments the millions and millions of people of India look to this Organization with faith and hope  and wish that this session of the Assembly may take yet another step  however modest  towards achieving the goal of peace  justice and progress."
"54",3227,"IRL",27,1972,"Mr. President  I wish to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly.58.	In your inaugural address you stated that your country owes its existence  its freedom  its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people but also to tremendous sacrifices'"" [2032nd meeting  para. 55].Here I am reminded of an observation made by the Polish representative in the Security Council on 29 August 1946 in connexion with our application for admission to the United Nations. On that occasion Dr. Lange said that.. the people of Poland have always  throughout the whole history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  had a great sympathy and feeling of great and deep community with the people of Ireland"". These are sentiments which are fully reciprocated by the Irish people. Consequently my delegation is most gratified that the presidency of the Assembly should be assumed by Poland  and we are particularly happy that this high office should devolve on a personality of your experience and competence. The proceedings over the past three weeks have demonstrated that you will discharge your functions in a manner calculated to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to enhance the standing of the Organization.59.	I should like  too  to say how much my delegation welcomed the election last December of Mr. Waldheim to fill the office of Secretary-General. Naturally his long experience in the field of international affairs  both as representative of his country at the United Nations and elsewhere and as Foreign Minister  eminently fitted him to undertake the onerous duties of that office. In the intervening months we have admired the initiative and drive he has shown since assuming those functions.60.	We have in particular been gratified by the Secretary- General's determination to use the powers conferred on him by Article 99 of the Charter to call attention to serious situations and by the readiness he has shown to make himself available to help in resolving such situations. We sincerely hope that the international community will heed his advice and will take advantage of the services which he  as depositary of important responsibilities under the Charter and ideally placed to play a detached role  is so well qualified to render. My delegation much appreciates his offer to help in any way possible in connexion with the North of Ireland.61.	When I spoke in this Assembly at the twenty-sixth session [1956th meeting] I said that we in Ireland believed that political and moral power grew not out of the barrel of a gun but out of the will of people to act together so as to translate values into facts. The United Nations was established for this purpose.62.	Men of vision and goodwill felt that the old inter-national order of sovereign  independent States which had characterized the nineteenth century was no longer adequate. The social  economic and political realities of the modern world require that we achieve a saner and more balanced view of our relations with our neighbors  within national societies  and between nation and nation  and indeed a saner and more balanced relationship between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit.63.	To meet our individual and collective purposes we are constantly adapting structures and institutions or developing new ones. If the structures fail the fault may lie not in the institution itself but in the will of the national or the international community to make it work. As a structure  the United Nations  the Secretary-General reminds us in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  is ""not an independent sovereign organization but an association of sovereign Governments  and ... its failures are also their failures"". [A/8701/Add.l  p. 2.]64.	The ability of the Organization to succeed is primarily dependent on the will of its Members. I believe that  if one examines the Organization's work and achievements to date and  more importantly  its capacity to meet the needs of the contemporary international society  one must conclude that as a structure  while some adaptations and adjustments could profitably be undertaken  the United Nations remains adequate for the tasks which it has assumed. It is not the structure which is lacking. It is the will and commitment to make it work that must be continually reinforced.65.	The central political function of the United Nations  as the Secretary-General has recalled  is  in the words of the preamble to the Charter  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". We can do this by making the Organization an instrument of collective security. Although mankind has been spared the horror of a third world war  nevertheless we are all aware that the United Nations has been unable to act to end a series of bitter and long-drawn- out localized conflicts. However  its failure in this regard is not due to the weakness of the Organization itself but manifestly to the unwillingness of the parties to those conflicts to make use of the instruments of peace-making and peace-keeping which the United Nations has at its disposal.66.	This is the eighth regular session in which our agenda includes as an item ""Comprehensive review of the whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their aspects"" [item 41]. It is well known that the Irish delegation has long stressed the importance of this item  for it is obvious that situations can arise  and quite unexpectedly  in which the peace-keeping role of the international community is the most effective means of containing potentially explosive conflicts. Ireland consequently has contended that it is essential that the United Nations evolve a system  within the existing structure  by which a peace-keeping operation can be mounted at short notice and can be effectively pursued until it has achieved its purpose. We have always held that the establishment of a peace-keeping operation is primarily a matter for the Security Council  but we have contended equally that if the Council cannot take that step the residual authority of the Assembly should be capable of being invoked. Moreover  once an operation has been mounted  it is vital that its successful completion should not be jeopardized through the inadequacy of the method of financing it.67.	Many previous speakers have referred to recent encouraging and hopeful developments in international and political relations the movement towards detente and dialog between the great Powers and between nations and States which are divided or dismembered by ideology or the fortunes of war. Ireland welcomes these developments  as we welcome  too  the movement towards full universality in this Organization  which gained enormous momentum last year when the People's Republic of China took its place among us. My delegation believes that Bangladesh should be a Member of the United Nations. For dialog detente and universality must surely serve to strengthen the structure of the United Nations and strengthen both the confidence of the peoples in the Organization and their will to make it work.68.	The difficulties confronting national and international society are frequently more acute and more complex in the economic area. The United Nations  through UNCTAD  is engaged in what the distinguished Foreign Minister of France rightly called a ""great movement of solidarity"" [2041st meeting  para. 73].69.	The problems with which UNCTAD has to deal are numerous  delicate and difficult. They directly affect the well-being and livelihood of all the peoples of the world.The relatively disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD  which took place some months ago in Chile  should not  therefore  be allowed to weaken our determination to persevere. The session should not be judged solely in the light of its immediate or concrete results. It served to define more clearly the areas in which our efforts must be concentrated and has made the international community both more aware of what needs to be done and more alive to the need to do it. It also demonstrated that  while the many problems involved are interrelated  the best hope of success lies in attacking them individually rather than in trying to solve them all simultaneously.70.	The interplay of our will to act and the structures through which we can act in the political and economic spheres is also manifest in the complex relations between man in general and the earth which we all inhabit. There has been a growing realization in recent years of the importance of achieving a saner and more balanced view of the relations between man and the human environment. Piecemeal and uncoordinated development of industry  overpopulation  urbanization and rural depopulation  we now realize  can disturb  and have disturbed  the delicate balance between man and his ecological habitat. Resources have been depleted by rapacious exploitation; other resources have been destroyed by pollution and industrial waste; and many of the great cities of our civilization have been made barbarous by the refuse of mindless consumerism and planned obsolescence.71.	The recent success of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  is therefore a heartening sign. It is evidence of a growing realization of the gravity and complexity of the problems which world industrialization and urbanization have created and of a willingness to develop through the United Nations system a means of regulating growth and achieving and maintaining a proper equilibrium between the exploitation and conservation of the earth's resources. The tasks of the United Nations in this regard and its responsibility to succeeding generations are hardly less arduous and grave than those which it has assumed in its primary purpose of saving our children from the scourge of war.72.	Twice in this century the clash of opposing national wills brought war to Europe. And the tragic lesson which war sometimes teaches and out of which the United Nations was born has a crucial relevance for Europeans. Those who had endured those terrible years had also reaped a new wisdom. The leaders of Europe realized that  if the continent was to avoid a further and perhaps final catastrophe  a profound transformation of European relations was necessary. National economic and political rivalries and dissension had to be replaced by co-operation and consensus.73.	Just as the adoption of the United Nations Charter laid the foundation of a new world structure and order  the Treaty of Rome  laid the foundations of a new regional structure and order in which the peoples of Europe would assume obligations which bound them even more closely and committed them to work out together the common destiny to which both geography and history summoned them. In the years since 1957  when the Treaty of Rome was signed  the European Economic Community has undergone a process of evolution and development-which has been sometimes painful and often difficult but which  we are confident  is now about to repay the work  the tenacity and the vision of those men who labored to translate the ideal of European economic and political unity into a reality.74.	Since I last addressed this Assembly the Irish people have expressed their overwhelming will to participate fully in the European Economic Community  which in a few months' time  with the accession of new member States  will group together some 250 million people. Ireland will bring its own heritage to this community of complementary cultures-which in Europe is endeavoring to build unity in diversity and  through co-operation and consensus  to guarantee to all our children that birthright of peace  of physical security  of material prosperity and of moral enrichment which should and can be the right of all mankind.75.	One paragraph in the speech made in this general debate by the United Kingdom Secretary of State struck me as being especially arresting. Speaking in the context of Europe about East-West relations  he said:""We must face the facts even when they are unpleasant. Since the last World War the confrontation over the years between the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led to an almost total loss of confidence. Western Europe had no desire for this  but the fact is that neighborliness  once confidence is broken  cannot be recreated in a day."" [2042nd meeting  para. 107.]76.	These remarks are  I feel  cogent in another context  that of Northern Ireland  and relevant to another relationship  that of my country and Great Britain. For the relationship between Britain and Ireland could not escape the influence of events in Northern Ireland over the past three or four years. These events have tended to reduce the problem there more and more to its most basic elements. The problem derives essentially from a conflict of political wills and is aggravated by a defective political structure.77.	The conflict of wills is that between Unionism and anti-Unionism  between those who seek to perpetuate a nakedly sectarian state in Northern Ireland-while pro-testing their loyalty and allegiance to Britain and British democracy-and those who are struggling for basic civil rights and substantial recognition of the legitimacy of their allegiance to the ideal of a united Ireland.78.	Northern Ireland was created as a political entity in order to provide an area in which to cater separately for unionism in Ireland. In the demographic and political circumstances of Ireland as a whole in 1920  when Northern Ireland was established  unionism could not-and cannot today-exist on its own. A purely Unionist area could not  and cannot  be established as viable. To cater for unionism therefore required the creation of an area divided into two communities with assured dominance for one. The structure of Northern Ireland  in consequences  had political instability built into it from the beginning. As a solution for the Anglo-Irish problem it was  in the words of my Prime Minister  ""a recipe for slow disaster"".79.	A permanent peace and genuine democracy cannot be established until all the elements of the dilemma in Northern Ireland are squarely faced and dealt with together. And as I have said  the central dilemma of the North lies not only in a conflict of wills  but in the fact that this conflict of wills can never be resolved within the existing structure of Northern Ireland. A permanent solution therefore can only be found  in the view of my delegation  through a genuine attempt both to resolve the conflict of wills and to replace the existing structure.80.	To date  all the attempts by Britain and by successive Belfast administrations to bring about consensus government in Northern Ireland through reform have focused on only one element of the dilemma. In 1969 when the abuses which the divisions within the area had made virtually inevitable came to world attention Britain intervened to see to the reform of these abuses. Attempts at piecemeal reform and the violent refusal of the more reactionary Unionists to accept them brought no stability and the situation grew worse.81.	Moreover the attempts at conciliation were accompanied by efforts to coerce the minority  which simply increased their alienation  and generated tolerance or support for violent tactics  and this in turn left the two communities in the North of Ireland even further divided than before. In short  these attempts to resolve the conflict of wills failed. Six months ago  in March  in the face of persistent violence and instability  Britain took the more drastic step of suspending the structures of dominance within the area by proroguing the Northern Parliament in an effort to reassemble the shattered pieces of the structure in a more equitable and stable way. But what Britain has to face is that the very structure of Northern Ireland the unworkable attempt to create an area to deal separately with unionism in Ireland-is the fundamental difficulty and that there is no way in which the pieces can be put together again so as to have permanent stability within a purely Northern Ireland setting. If a successful political structure is to be built  it must be one which is open to  and capable of  operating in a wider context  that of Ireland as a whole.82.	But the conflict of wills must also be faced. Britain and Ireland together with the divided communities in the North will have to be involved in the resolution of that conflict. The deepest concerns of the Unionist community in Ireland will have to be  and can be  met by an eventual accommodation with the national majority by negotiation and on terms acceptable to both. And the deepest concerns and desires of the Unionist community in Ireland cannot be met any other way-certainly not by coercion or by the inter-communal violence who threatens all Irishmen with common ruin.83.	It is evident that there can be no instant solution to the present difficulties. Short-term measures alone  based on a simple balance of forces within the area  will not be enough.84.	There is general acceptance at present of the need to provide a new framework for administration in the North of Ireland. This administration must provide for an equitable division of political power between the elected representatives of the communities in the area  and there must be no possibility of the abuse of security powers in the interests of one community. Beyond this  there must be recognition of  and a real political outlet for  the legitimate aspirations of the non-Unionist community.85.	Interim measures can allow a process of reconciliation to begin: membership by Britain and both parts of Ireland in the European Community will undoubtedly help. But the process of reconciliation will advance only if there is an acceptance of the need to promote and work positively towards a stable and lasting settlement on a new basis in Ireland. It is not enough simply to speak of this as a ""legitimate aspiration""  or to suggest that reconciliation  now  is a prerequisite to any progress towards this aim. If a real and lasting process of reconciliation is to begin now  there must be courageous and far-sighted policy decisions aimed at such a settlement  and there must be provision for movement towards it as the opportunities become available.86.	In brief  the aim must be not merely to hope for but to encourage actively  by every available political means  progress towards a new Ireland. It would clearly be wrong to repeat on a larger scale in the island as a whole a pattern which has already proved unstable in the North. So we must try to achieve  by agreement  new political institutions in Ireland which do not divide its communities or subordinate one to another  but which are responsive to all elements of its population and their diversity of outlook and tradition. A beginning must be made now which will promote and encourage progress in the right direction  but it would be unwise to demand absolutes  or to set a rigid time-table.87.	In speaking to the General Assembly as I have done on tills issue  which deeply troubles us in Ireland  I should like to emphasize that my Government does not consider that the interests of the national majority in Ireland are in any way at variance with the real  long-term interests of the Unionist community. Nor are the interests of the Irish people in conflict with those of the British people. We consider that a stable and lasting settlement in Ireland on the basis I have outlined is in the real interest of both  and we believe and hope that the British Government will come to see this  if indeed it has not begun to do so already.88.	Over the past year there have been exchanges of view between the British and Irish Governments on the mutual problem of Northern Ireland. The situation there and the approach to it I have outlined require deep involvement by both Governments.89.	The Irish Government  for its part  is fully prepared to play a constructive role in reaching a just and lasting settlement of this last difficult problem in Anglo-Irish relations. It will act  by every constitutional means open to it  to work towards a reasoned political settlement  because it believes such a settlement would be clearly in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland  of both the British and Irish Governments  and of all the people of both islands."
"55",3274,"IRN",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like at the outset to express my delegation's sincere felicitations on your election as the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high post is indeed a tribute to your eminent qualities as a diplomat and statesman  as well as to your country  which has made valuable contributions to the cause of the United Nations. As I have had the honor to represent my country in Poland  I stand reminded of the depth and richness of your country's culture  and believe that you will ably personify the courage of its people. I have no doubt that you will perform your duties here with the same distinction that has characterized your past public services.27.	I wish also to pay a high tribute to the outgoing President of the Assembly  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  for his valuable contributions to our Organization.28.	Allow me  moreover  to extend once again my delegation's warmest congratulations-to our new Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on his appointment to this most important office.29.	It is indeed a source of gratification to continue to have at the helm of this Organization a man of great public distinction and international stature. In the course of the past year he has demonstrated his acute awareness of world problems and in the interest of international peace and security he has taken constructive measures to deal with problems before they reach a critical stage. We are confident he will continue to discharge faithfully  and with devotion and foresight  the awesome responsibilities that have been entrusted to him. My delegation pledges to him its unequivocal support and co-operation.30.	In this context it is fitting to recall once more the valuable contributions rendered by our former Secretary-General  UThant  whose tireless efforts in the cause of world peace and security will long be remembered.31.	Since the last session of the General Assembly the world has undergone significant changes in both the political and the economic fields. Hie rigid bipolarity of the past is making way for a more diversified and multilateral world power structure.32.	In the light of these circumstances my delegation views with some optimism the recent unfolding panorama of political events on the world scene.33.	In this context  the latest developments in Asia deserve our special attention. The People's Republic of China has joined the community of nations. Pragmatic and sustained efforts towards the normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States has smoothed the way for a policy of coexistence between those two Powers. This new understanding is indeed a milestone in the development of a better political climate in Asia and in the world.34.	The recent contacts between South and North Korea are fraught with hopeful signs for the eventual reunification of the two parts of Korea and can be considered the first step towards defusing existing frictions in that area.35.	The latest sequel of political events on the Indian subcontinent also offers encouraging prospects for the restoration of peace. Both Pakistan and India are reviewing their relations and seeking in earnest to find mutually acceptable solutions to their existing problems. The initiative taken by President Bhutto of Pakistan in paving the way for a meeting between the leaders of those two countries in the month of June of this year and the ensuing Simla Agreement are a constructive starting-point and could result in the opening of a new phase in relations between Pakistan and India. It is our fervent hope that the question of disputed territories will be resolved and that the Pakistani prisoners of war will be released in accordance with the relevant Geneva Conventions  thus creating an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of normal relations between the two nations. In this respect  the United Nations should assist in bringing about a just settlement of outstanding disputes as promptly as possible.36.	The ratification of the friendship and frontier treaties with the Federal Republic of Germany by the Soviet Union and by Poland and the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin are also symbolic of the significant strides made towards creating a detente in Europe. These agreements will no doubt facilitate the road to future negotiations between the countries members of NATO and the countries signatories of the Warsaw Pact with the ultimate aim of convening a conference on European security.37.	This year's session of the General Assembly is marked by an atmosphere of political realism* The historic summit meetings held in Peking between the leaders of the United States and China and in Moscow between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States have accorded a sharp impetus to forces actively engaged in strengthening the pillars of international security.38.	Indeed  the three global Powers have made landmark progress towards defining their positions and diminishing the causes of misunderstanding in an attempt to relax world tensions and to provide the peoples of the world with a more secure environment in which to live.39.	The Declaration of Basic Principles of Relations between the United States and the USSR  adopted at Moscow on 29 May 1972  constitutes a strong reaffirmation of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.40.	The strategic arms limitation agreements  adopted at Moscow on 26 May 1972  are yet another significant outcome of the conference between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. This and further agreements in areas of mutual interest such as space  science and technology  medical research and trade  are bound to serve peaceful and humanitarian aims and will no doubt reduce international frictions and enhance mutual trust and amity among nations.41.	All these new developments have left a deep imprint on the standing and composition of our Organization.42.	The United Nations has consequently expanded its membership and is now approaching its goal of universality.Last year  we applauded the restoration of the lawful rights in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China and the admission of five new Members. We hope this trend will continue until the United Nations brings under its roof all countries which remain outside the Organization.43.	However  in spite of these favourable trends  the picture of the world scene remains rather dark.44.	The situation in the Middle East has taken a turn for the worse  especially during recent weeks. The latest armed interventions against Syria and Lebanon have further endangered peace and security in the area. A precarious situation continues to loom large  causing further frustrations and aggravations. The Arab- Republic of Egypt  motivated by a sense of realism and compromise  has made successive peace overtures to Israel with a view to an equitable settlement of all its outstanding disputes. These efforts have  however  met with no positive response and have failed to persuade Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.45.	Other peaceful initiatives have also yielded no results. Ambassador Jarring's mission has not received the cooperation necessary for its successful accomplishment. All indications are  therefore  that nothing concrete has been achieved to resolve the Middle East crisis since the last session of the General Assembly.46.	In spite of the inability of the Arab States and Israel to reach an agreement  my delegation continues to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) constitutes the most workable basis for u political settlement of existing disputes. In our considered view it is time that more intensified and collective efforts be made within the context of that resolution to eliminate the sources of contention and to guarantee the territorial integrity and independence of all States in the region.47.	South-East Asia is another area of the world beset by strife  chronic war and economic dislocation. During the past year  the war in Viet-Nam has expanded with alarming speed and devastating impact. It is our fervent hope  however  that normality and peace will be restored to Viet-Nam within the framework of the Geneva Conventions and on the basis of strict respect for the right of the people to self-determination  to independent development and to the inviolability of their territorial integrity.48.	More than a decade after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  colonialism persists in dominating certain parts of Africa. In fact  a figure in excess of one tenth of the population of the African continent continues to be oppressed by the colonial yoke and racial discrimination. In Namibia  Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau)  and Zimbabwe  millions of people are being denied their rights to political  social and economic self-expression  to human dignity and to self- determination. Neither the efforts of the United Nations nor the concerted pressure exerted by mankind has succeeded in eliminating the deprivation of human rights and fundamental freedoms inflicted by the colonial Powers.49.	In this connexion we welcomed the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa. Those meetings  which brought the members of the Security Council in closer touch with the problems and aspirations of the peoples of Africa  may  hopefully  open the way for the Security Council to take more effective measures in this regard. They have also helped reinforce the determination of the African countries to utilize the instruments of this Organization to combat colonialism  racial discrimination and  in particular  apartheid. It is indeed gratifying that in this realm the Council adopted positive resolutions on some major problems.50.	It is the earnest hope of my delegation that Members of the United Nations will  in concert  pool their energies to eradicate the last relics of colonialism and racism in all its forms and manifestations.51.	Progress in the field of disarmament since our last session has been encouraging. First and foremost is the adoption and signing of the Convention on the banning of biological weapons.  This Convention holds open the possibility of an agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons and contains an explicit pledge by all parties to reach an early accord in this regard. Combined with past achievements in arms control and disarmament  it is testimony to the progress made by the United Nations in the limitation of armaments. However  it would be purblind optimism to deny that a great deal remains to be done.52.	Despite an agreement reached in principle by the major Powers a decade ago  a substantive programme of general and complete disarmament has yet to be launched. We believe  as we stated last year  that marginal agreements providing for the limitation of armaments in regional or functional areas are not goals in themselves and cannot supplant general and complete disarmament as an ultimate objective [1940th meeting  para 116].53.	In this connexion it is indeed a source of dismay that little progress has been achieved in the vital area of a comprehensive test ban. The partial test-ban Treaty  has been at the most a qualified success and  due to its restricted sphere of control  has left the door open to the increasing use of underground testing. The question of inspection stands as the main obstacle to a comprehensive test-ban Treaty  but has not precluded progress in other areas of disarmament.54.	To cite the most recent example  the strategic arms limitation agreements  concluded in May of this year  are based on an ""open skies"" inspection system. Therefore  it is a matter for regret that the faith and the trust demonstrated in this case and in the case of other important agreements have not served as a yardstick for an agreement on a comprehensive test ban.55.	We consider the agreements concluded in Moscow in May of this year to be of seminal importance. The agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics designed to impose quantitative limits on their strategic weapons and to expand their relations in the field of trade  medicine and space  provide ample evidence of the desire of both countries to advance from mere detente and coexistence to active co-operation.56.	We hope the momentum gained will continue to increase in the future and result in a wider and more comprehensive agreement covering the entire European continent. We also hope that these practical achievements will have an encouraging and beneficial effect on the whole spectrum of issues relating to conventional and nuclear disarmament. In fact  we anxiously look forward to the day when man's inventive genius in creating weapons of total destruction will be employed with equal effectiveness and skill in achieving total disarmament.57.	The preservation of our environment has also assumed a new dimension and importance for all the States and peoples of the world. It is a subject which directly impinges on their survival  well-being  and socio-economic development. Nations can no longer afford to be heedless about the vulnerability of their ecology and natural resources to misuse and contamination.58.	During the past five years  the findings of science have made us aware of the environmental consequences of material progress either in hiospheric or psycho-social terms. They have awakened the consciousness of mankind to its natural heritage and instilled in us a sense of responsibility to future generations.59.	The rising world-wide concern focused on this problem led the United Nations to convene the first major international conference on the human environment in Stockholm. The historic Declaration of the Conference has established a set of guidelines which could  if implemented in good faith  arrest and perhaps even reverse the increasing deterioration of the quality of life on our planet.60.	With this conviction  the Iranian Government has  in recent years  engaged in a series of conservational reform laws including the nationalization of its forests  rangeland and water resources.61.	The International Conference on the Conservation of Wetlands and Waterfowl  held at Ramsar in Iran  which received unanimous support by ail the participating countries  was an apt illustration of Iran's deep interest in all aspects of conservation. It was on this occasion that the foundation for the establishment in southern Iran of an ecological research station of global scope  ir. joint trust with an appropriate international agency at the Arjan International Environmental Reserve  was laid to underline the pressing needs of contemporary society. Moreover  Iran has decided to offer an annual international award in the amount of $20 000 for the most outstanding contribution made in the field of human environment. Iran has also taken steps to establish an urgently needed monitoring3 See Report of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  Stockholm  5-16 June 1972 (United Nations publications  Sales No. E.73.II.A.14)  chap. I.system to control pollution in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. We have also signed a protocol with the Government of the Soviet Union laying down conditions for the prevention of pollution of the Caspian Sea; it is hoped this protocol will result in a bilateral convention. In addition  our two Governments have been in contact with a view to concluding  within the framework of the Ramsar Agreement  accords of a similar nature regarding our common wildlife resources.62.	Another area of rising importance is the peaceful uses of the sea. The ocean has opened a new horizon to man's needs and expectations. This issue involves not only the exploration and exploitation of the virgin resources of the sea but also the formation of new regimes for law  politics and socio-economics.63.	It is generally agreed that the sea-bed provides a fertile field for the devising of new laws of the sea. This consensus is clearly reflected in the Declaration of Principles  approved by the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly   which delineated modalities for progress in this field. We are of the belief that  on the issue of the law of the sea  any successful multilateral initiative must represent and adequately accommodate various interests in socioeconomic terms and aiso take into consideration geographical and geological problems.64.	In the area of economics and trade  we are still living under archaic and radically unjust economic precepts governing relations among States. Under present conditions  the division of material prosperity which separates the developing and the developed countries will become sharper  and the widening gap of economic imbalance among nations will prove even more difficult to bridge.65.	In this regard the hopes pinned on the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) had discouraging results. The deliberations of the Conference were marked by the intransigence of economically advanced countries  which did not wish to accommodate their interests to the rising needs of the economically less advanced nations and by the refusal of the former to use trade and monetary policies to redress the existing imbalance.66.	My August Sovereign clearly described this problem at the fifty-seventh session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva in June this year:""There is no doubt that the elimination of commercial rivalries  the removal of the barriers which now exist in this domain and international monetary stabilization are of vital importance for the developing countries. .. .prices of exports from industrialist countries are constantly rising.... In other words  when the industrialized countries export their products  they also export inflation...""The inflationary methods practiced by the industrialized countries have caused an increase in interest rates and  consequently  foreign loans to the developing countries have become more expensive."" 67.	It is therefore essential that provision be made to guarantee a stable and just price for the raw materials and primary products of the less developed countries  in order to cushion recurring price fluctuations. In any policy adopted by the economically advanced nations and designed to reorganize the structure of the international monetary system for the purpose of ensuring greater world  financial stability  the interests of less advanced countries  as well as those of the entire community of nations  should be adequately reflected. These remedies  in addition to the implementation of UNCTAD's recommendation that the economically advanced countries should allocate 1 per cent of their gross national product for assistance to the less advanced nations  could serve as an effective means of coping with some of the problems which beset the international community.68.	Before concluding  I wish to turn to a question which deserves particular attention. The rise in terrorism and violence in recent times has aroused concern and indignation throughout the world. We deplore and condemn such acts  which endanger or take innocent lives. The rule of law is of paramount importance to all of us. If we allow lawlessness to continue unchecked  the United Nations will be totally undermined.69.	The Secretary-General should be commended for having taken the initiative to invite the attention of the United Nations [A/8791 and Add.l] to a matter which threatens to throw the whole fabric of the international order into disarray. We believe that the problem should be dealt with most urgently in all its aspects  including its underlying causes. It is high time the United Nations took necessary and effective measures to curb and eradicate terrorism in all its forms.70.	Every year  as we enter this majestic hall to pay a tribute to the founders of the United Nations for the contribution they have made to the pursuit of a lasting peace for humanity  our hearts yearn with the hope of accomplishment. It is once again the deep-seated wish of my Government and delegation to voice this hope.71.	As developments last year have shown  we are confident that  given a spirit of compromise and reconciliation  greater progress could be made in reducing threats to peace and security throughout the world. We therefore look to the future with optimism. In the final analysis  it is our earnest hope that concrete steps will be taken to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations as a universal peace machinery  with the aim of converting theaters of conflict and areas of discord into fields ripe for co-operation and progress."
"56",3321,"IRQ",27,1972,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to convey to you our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. While wishing you every success in the fulfillment of the tasks of your high office  I am confident that your acknowledged wisdom and your judgment will enable you to preside successfully over our deliberations in a manner which will attain the best possible results for this session.2.	In extending its congratulations to you  Mr. President  the Iraqi delegation is also expressing its satisfaction at the fact that this high office is occupied by a person who is a national of a country with which Iraq has the closest ties of friendship and co-operation.3.	I should also like to pay a tribute  on this occasion  to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  for his valuable efforts in the service of the United Nations during his presidency of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.4.	The people of Iraq follow with close attention the developments in all parts of the world. We believe that there is a great necessity for our international Organization to double its efforts to strengthen its sublime Charter and to accomplish its noble objectives.5.	The peoples of the third world  and other peace-loving peoples  have continued their struggle against colonialism  imperialism and backwardness; they have not yet  however  attained all that they desire. The roots of colonialism rundeep and are still alive with the forces of the authority and the exploitation which they have accumulated through the centuries.6.	In fact we have not noted since the end of the last session of the General Assembly any indication on the part of the colonialist States of a change in their policies or a readiness to co-operate with the United Nations in a constructive joint effort to honor the rights of peoples  to banish the prevalent fears and to eliminate the evils of greedy monopolies. Nevertheless  we shall remain optimistic because we have faith in the future of peoples and in their struggle for their just cause.7.	The foreign policy of the Republic of Iraq seeks to establish the best and soundest of relations with other States  based on the principles of respect for independence and sovereignty and mutual efforts for the development and strengthening of those relations. Our policy is one of strict adherence to  and support of  the Charter of the United Nations. We are also strongly in favor of creating circumstances for strengthening faith in the world Organization and its specialized agencies to enable them to fulfill their mission and to raise them to the level of their responsibilities.8.	Many peoples have achieved  through persistent struggle  their right to freedom and self-determination. The United Nations  through its Declaration on the rights of peoples to self-determination and independence   has itself played a prominent part in supporting and promoting the aspirations of those peoples.9.	However  there are many other peoples still suffering under the yoke of colonialism  exploitation and racial discrimination.10.	The ugliest manifestation of this reality is perhaps to be found in what the world is now witnessing in Palestine.11.	The forces of Zionist colonialism  supported by international imperialism with the United States at its head  have been able to drive the people of Palestine out of their homeland and keep them out for nearly a quarter of a century. Since 5 June 1967 Zionist aggression has extended into three Arab States Members of this Organization  occupying parts of their territories  ejecting their inhabitants and establishing colonial para-military settlements in those occupied territories.A/PV.205512.	The United Nations has reaffirmed in numerous resolutions the rights of the Palestinian people to repatriation and to self-determination. But because of Israel's contemptuous intransigence  and the failure of the United Nations to implement their provisions  those resolutions have been reduced to worthless scraps of paper.13.	We firmly believe that the so-called Middle East problem cannot be solved  and peace in our area cannot be achieved  unless the people of Palestine are given the opportunity to exercise all their inalienable rights  particularly their right to self-determination: neither can there be any peace unless the Israeli occupation of Arab territories is ended. Unless those conditions are achieved  the Middle East will remain charged with dangers imperiling world peace.14.	A deep sense of injustice has driven the Palestinian people to ignite the flames of revolution. They have realized that there is no way for them to attain a free and respectable life  to return to the land of their fathers and forefathers  except through self-sacrifice and armed struggle  which represent the zenith of patriotism and the highest example of wars of liberation. The people of Palestine have come to know the meaning of this self- sacrifice in facing Zionist nazism  as many other peoples knew it in resisting Hitler's Nazi occupation.15.	My Government  from the very beginning  did not have much faith in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The resolution is not in conformity with the principles of the Charter  which prohibit the use of force in international relations and which clearly deny to the aggressor the enjoyment of any gain or advantages resulting therefrom. Yet  despite the resolution  with all its serious shortcomings both in form and in substance  Israel  which has never heeded United Nations resolutions concerning the rights of the Palestinian people  persists in its expansionist policies and tries to achieve further gains at the expense of the people of Palestine and of the Arab countries.16.	To deny the people of Palestine their rights  to try to settle the problem of Palestine without the participation of the Palestinians themselves  to ignore the resolutions adopted by the United Nations within the last quarter of a century to solve the problem  and then to reward the aggressor with concessions are the main deficiencies underlying Security Council resolution 242 (1967).17.	The Security Council should have stipulated the determination of the Zionist aggression and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories without any delay and without attaching any conditions to such stipulations.18.	One important aspect of the situation in the Middle East has become a source of deep concern for all the peoples of the world  namely  Israel's policies regarding the city of Jerusalem. The United Nations has adopted many resolutions  known to all  to preserve the character of Jerusalem as a city which is holy to many peoples and to many religions. Israel's response has again been one of complete disregard and arrogant disdain. Excavations and demolitions continue in many quarters of the city in complete indifference to its sanctity and to its archaeological landmarks  which unite the past with the present and represent man's heritage of civilization in our part of the world. Zionism has now come to destroy the relics of this heritage. In spite of the strong reactions of everyone who values all that Jerusalem represents  Israel  as always  has ignored-in fact  dismissed with contempt the great concern expressed by the international community.19.	Israel's expansionist settler colonialism is confirmed by its multi directional aggressions. Its aim is to conquer further territories and to induce further Jewish immigration into Palestine by every possible scheme  in order to realize the dreams of Zionist expansionism in establishing ""Greater Israel"". These are the factors which distinguish the problem of Palestine from the problems of other peoples whose lands have been partitioned  like Germany  Korea and Viet-Nam. The struggle in Palestine is not one between the countrymen of one land; it is one between the rightful owner and an intruder  between a usurping aggressor and the people made the victim of that aggression. It is only natural that those who ignore this basic nature of the conflict in Palestine should feel tempted to call for direct negotiations between the parties concerned.20.	In order to ensure respect for the Charter of the United Nations and observance of its principles as the basis of international relations  it is imperative  first and foremost  that the great Powers  which bear special responsibilities for preserving international security  should themselves respect the principles of the Charter. It is no secret that the people of Iraq  like many other peoples throughout the world  have come to question the value of the international Organization in maintaining peace and justice in view of the behavior of some of the great Powers among its Members.21.	During last September Israel mounted a campaign of revenge and terrorism against Syria and Lebanon  directed above all against innocent civilians and the inhabitants of the Palestinian refugee camps. We have never doubted that Israel would never be content with the ejection of the Palestinians from their homeland  but would aim at their extermination and the annihilation of the very concept of the existence of a Palestinian people.22.	What we did not expect  even from the United States with its well-known support and loyalty to Israel  was a resort to the use of the veto to defeat a draft resolution which only sought to restore a cease-fire violated by Israel in its murderous attacks against Lebanon and Syria. The Security Council was thus prevented from discharging its most elementary duty in the maintenance of international peace and security. Does anyone doubt the ulterior motives which led the United States Government to take that shameful attitude  exposing international peace and security to certain danger in the interests of its own political expediencies?23.	The reasons for the peoples' loss of confidence in the world Organization and for its failure to live up to the hopes placed in it are not to be found in its so-called neglect of acts of ""political terrorism""  as some have claimed  but rather in the impotence of the United Nations in the face of the international terrorism practiced by one of the major Powers among its own members against many peoples and in many different parts of the world.24.	The General Assembly has decided  at the request of the Secretary-General  to debate at its present session the subject of international terrorism with its underlying causes and motives [item 92]. My delegation believes that the consideration of the item in its amended form will clarify the full dimensions of this problem. But we cannot close our eyes to  nor remain silent about  a fact which by now is well-known to all  namely  the exploitation of this item by the United States for internal political purposes. Nor can we ignore the efforts by some other Powers to exploit this debate so as to discredit and to strangle national liberation movements  under the guise of combating terrorism and in the name of the international community.25.	We are greatly surprised to see that the Government of the United States should hasten to lead the campaign of what it terms combating terrorism  at a time when the United Nations itself and permanent missions here in New York are subjected to threats and acts of violence by American terrorist organizations  without the United States authorities taking any effective action against those terrorists in contravention of its contractual obligations towards the United Nations. We also find it totally unacceptable that the United States Government should  under the cloak of humanitarian motivations  call for action against terrorism while a deluge of American bombs engulfs the innocent women and children of Viet-Nam  and ""civilized"" American generals threaten to bomb that valiant people back to the Stone Age.26.	There exist in the Arabian Gulf area conditions which threaten peace and foreshadow dire consequences. Imperialism is actively trying to consolidate its influence in the Arabian Gulf under the pretext of filling a so-called vacuum in the wake of the withdrawal of British forces. In pursuit of these aims  international imperialism has no compunction about employing any and all available means.27.	The Iraqi Government is convinced that peace and security will not prevail in the Arabian Gulf unless the States in that area respect one another's sovereignty and independence. Towards the end of last year  however  Iranian forces occupied three Arab islands in the Gulf  resorting to the use of force to achieve Iran's expansionist ambitions  in violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law  which explicitly prohibit the use of force in international relations. The laxity of the United Nations organs in taking effective measures to restore right and justice is bound to encourage expansionist ambitions which would undoubtedly endanger international peace and security in the area.28.	During the last two sessions of the General Assembly  the Iraqi delegation outlined the action of our neighbor Iran in unilaterally declaring the abrogation of the Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Treaty  signed at Teheran on 4 July 1937. This Treaty  in force for over 30 years  was freely concluded by both parties  and registered with the League of Nations  in order to put an end to their frontier differences. It appears that our neighbor Iran overlooked the fact that the sanctity of treaties is one of the fundamental principles of international law  and that the violation of treaties was  and is  among the gravest transgressions for which a State is held accountable to the international community. The unilateral abrogation of a treaty  for whatever reason  is considered one of the most serious of violations.29.	Iraq continues to maintain its adherence to the 1937 Treaty  and is convinced that Iran has no right to abrogate the Treaty unilaterally. Iraq has expressed its readiness to refer this question to the International Court of Justice. We hereby renew this offer. Iran's procrastinations in accepting our offer and its continued negative attitude are but an expression of Iran's determination to defy the most important and most securely established rules of international law.30.	My Government takes every possible opportunity to reaffirm its peaceful policies and its desire to establish the best of relations with all States. The latest affirmation of this policy towards Iran was expressed a few months ago by the President of Iraq  Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr  when he stated:""The Government of Iran  one of our neighbors  has for the last three and a half years adopted unwarranted hostile attitudes against Iraq and the Arab nation  as exemplified by its unilateral abrogation of the 1937 Boundary Treaty and the continued acts of provocation along our borders threatening our peace and security. It carried its policies to the extent of usurping parts of Arab lands in its occupation of the three Arab islands in the Arabian Gulf. These actions are bound to have harmful effects on Arab-Iranian relations  not only at present but also in the future  especially since they coincide with the Zionist-imperialist onslaught on the Arab people. We shall strongly uphold our rights and shall continue to oppose the use of such methods for the solution of problems. In our opinion  those methods constitute violations of international obligations in addition to being an outcome of outmoded policies. We reaffirm here again our respect for the historical ties which bind us to the friendly Iranian peoples as we reaffirm our sincere desire to establish good-neighborly relations with them on the basis of continued co-operation for the benefit of our mutual interests. We have for the last three-and-a-half years followed a policy of self-restraint and resorted to reason in confronting the adventurist policies into which the colonialist forces tried to draw us. While upholding our rights and national interests  we reiterate our readiness  always  to solve problems peacefully  provided the Government of Iran will reconsider its attitude  abandon its present policy and follow the path of good-neighborliness with Iraq and the Arab nation.""31.	In the Far East  we are witnessing an appalling tragedy: the tragedy of the unequal war in Viet-Nam  the indiscriminate mass killings of the VietNamese people by the United States forces and the devastating destruction by its missiles  airplanes and napalm of Vietnamese civilian installations  including hospitals  schools and dikes.32.	The war in Viet-Nam has been condemned by all peoples of the world  including progressive liberals within the United States itself. Our people calls for the full and immediate withdrawal of United States forces from IndoChina  in order to enable its peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and to express their will freely without foreign intervention. Our people supports the proposal for- the establishment of an international body which would be entrusted with assisting Viet-Nam for the immediate rehabilitation of both North and South after the devastation of the prolonged years of fighting. The necessary resources for such rehabilitation should be provided by the United Nations: the rich States  headed by the United States  should provide the major part of such assistance. What we have said about the aggression against the Vietnamese people applies equally to the aggression against the peaceful people of Cambodia. Here was a nation enjoying freedom and full of hope  but the United States Government  which does not approve of those who refuse to fall into line with its policies  resorted to its well-known methods and intelligence services. Endangering the security and the stability of the Cambodian people  it installed a puppet regime to replace the legitimate Government  which still enjoys the support and the sympathy of the majority of peoples.33.	There are still a number of peoples languishing under the yoke of colonialism and vassalage. The Republic of Iraq calls upon the United Nations to rescue these peoples and to support their just struggle to achieve independence  thus implementing the United Nations' own resolutions and securing the realization of its aims and respect for its principles.34.	We demand the liquidation of all forms of colonialism  wherever found  and the elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. Our people  under the leadership of the Socialist Arab Ba'ath Party  which has dedicated itself to the struggle for freedom and independence  stands with the peoples' legitimate resistance to colonialism  imperialism and discrimination. It demands the termination of the United States occupation of Korea and of the United States exploitation of the United Nations flag in its flagrant interference with the unity of the Korean people. We support the right of the Korean people to self-determination and to reunification. Our people supports the liberation movements in Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde. It condemns the white minority regime in Rhodesia and sincerely hopes that all States will respect United Nations resolutions and refrain from establishing any economic relations with Ian Smith's illegal regime.35.	We condemn the policies of apartheid and the repression imposed by the South African Government on the Africans  the indigenous people of the land. We cannot help but salute  on this occasion  the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe and pay a tribute to their struggle  in the hope that they will soon achieve their freedom and enjoy full sovereignty and independence.36.	The people of Iraq has chosen the policy of non-alignment in iis international relations  thus providing itself with the opportunity to participate in joint efforts for the realization of peace and security and to avoid the evils of aggressive pacts  with all their propensity to create confrontations and crises. The world has already seen the effectiveness of the policies of non-alignment in sparing mankind the consequences of blocs and military alliances.37.	The Republic of Iraq would welcome any sound agreement concerning the limitation of the armaments race. The arrival at a comprehensive agreement on disarmament would undoubtedly diminish the dangers of war and save vast sums which might be diverted to peaceful purposes  especially to assistance to the developing countries.38.	We support complete disarmament under effective international control and confirm our support for the prohibition of the use and the manufacture of chemical  biological and other similar weapons. My Government associates itself with the proposals concerning the declaration of certain areas as zones of peace. It also supports the convocation of a world conference on disarmament.39.	My Government welcomes all efforts aimed at the utilization of atomic energy  the sea-bed and outer space for peaceful purposes. It would welcome a conference on the law of the sea  provided that adequate preparation were made to ensure its success in a manner which would guarantee the interests of all States and especially those of the developing countries. Special attention should be given to the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  and the proposals made by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  in order to see that justice is done to the developing countries  to enable them to utilize their resources and  finally  to create the conditions which would narrow the gap between the developing and the developed countries.40.	On this occasion I should like to refer briefly to the measures taken by my Government on 1 July of this year to nationalize the operations of the Iraq Petroleum Company.41.	That company  which had monopolized our petroleum resources for nearly half a century  went too far in ignoring our just demands and adopted a policy of procrastination and equivocation regarding those demands. While the Iraqi Government tried earnestly to arrive at a just solution to the problems outstanding  the company resorted to pressure tactics by reducing production in order to undermine the economy of the country. Those tactics led the negotiations which had been going on for many years into an impasse. It was then the duty of the Government to nationalize the company's operations in order to safeguard the rights of the people. In following this course of action Iraq was exercising a definite right recognized by international law and stated in numerous United Nations resolutions which affirm the sovereignty of States over their natural resources. In the nationalization decree we have declared our readiness to compensate the company.42.	In his eloquent statement before the General Assembly Mr. Maurice Schumann said that hope was ""a difficult virtue"" [2041st meeting  para. 60J. Although I have expressed here today the apprehensions and suspicions which preoccupy the minds of many peoples about the role of the United Nations and its ability to rise to the level of the hopes placed in it  I personally still greatly hope that these suspicions will not be confirmed.43.	The peoples of the whole world are united in the desire to establish an international community  living in peace  in which the principles of freedom and justice prevail. Those peoples regard the United Nations as the only means for attaining that goal. Although it is true that much of that hope for the United Nations has evaporated  our faith in man and in his determination to realize his longings for freedom  peace and justice saves us from total despair. It enables us to continue our support for the United Nations so that we may attain mankind's common goal."
"57",3368,"ISL",27,1972," Mr. President  I want to join my colleagues who have spoken before me in extending to you my delegation's warmest congratulations upon your election as President of this session of the Assembly.61.	The participation of my delegation in the present general debate will be limited to a discussion of the situation in the waters around Iceland. A dangerous situation exists now in that part of the world which I feel should be brought to the attention of the General Assembly. I shall discuss that situation first specifically and then in the wider framework of the law of the sea in general  particularly in light of the preparations being made for the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The general implications of this specific case will then be readily realized.62.	Let me first describe the situation in the seas surrounding Iceland.63.	The plain fact is that on 1 September 1972  the fishery limits off Iceland were extended to 50 miles  as I had the honor to announce from this rostrum a year ago [1945th meeting]. For more than a year now efforts have been made to reach a practical solution of the problems with which the trawler industries of the nations most concerned have been faced in this connexion. On that basis an agreement was concluded on 7 September 1972 between Belgium and Iceland  whereby a specific number of Belgian trawlers have been licensed by Iceland to fish until 1 June 1974  during specified periods in certain areas inside the new limits. This is a practical arrangement which  under the circumstances  proved to constitute an acceptable solution of the problems involved. Similar arrangements have been made in the case of fishing vessels from the Faeroe islands.64.	Discussions with the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany are still in progress  but no solution has been found. Only one Member of the United Nations -the United Kingdom-has continued to send fishing vessels inside the limits in violation of Icelandic laws and regulations  and serious incidents have already occurred. These activities are connected with an indication of interim measures of protection  dated 17 August 1972. issued by the International Court of Justice   which purports to authorize British trawlers to catch 170 000 tons of fish annually in the Icelandic area. The United Kingdom has in effect sought to institute proceedings before the Court on the basis of an Exchange of Notes of 1961. 65.	The Government of Iceland already  on 31 August 1971  informed the Government of the United Kingdom that it considered the acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction under the 1961 agreement to have achieved its objective and that the agreement was consequently terminated. This view was subsequently confirmed by a unanimous vote of the Parliament of Iceland  the Althing. In order to clarify the position I wish  with your permission  Mr. President  to read to the Assembly the text of the Icelandic aide-memoire of 31 August 1971  which was transmitted to the Government of the United Kingdom. It reads as follows:""On 11 March 1961 the Governments of Iceland and the United Kingdom exchanged Notes for the settlement of the fisheries dispute between the two countries  which had its origin in the extension of Iceland's fishery limits effected in 1958. In that Exchange of Notes it was stated:"" ""The Icelandic Government will continue to work for the implementation of the Althing Resolution of 5 May 1959 regarding the extension of fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland  but shall give to the United Kingdom Government six months' notice of such extension and  in case of a dispute in relation to such extension  the matter shall  at the request of either party  be referred to the International Court of Justice.'""In the opinion of the Icelandic Government  which is continuing to work for the implementation of the Althing Resolution in the light of increased knowledge and other developments that have occurred since that Exchange of Notes  the object and purpose of the provisions for recourse to judicial settlement of certain matters envisaged in the passage quoted above have been fully achieved. In the period of ten years which has elapsed  the United Kingdom Government enjoyed the benefit of the Icelandic Government's policy to the effect that further extension of the limits of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction would be placed in abeyance for a reasonable and equitable period. Continuation of that policy by the Icelandic Government  in the light of intervening scientific and economic evolution (including the ever greater threat of increased diversion of highly developed fishing effort to the Icelandic area) has become excessively onerous and unacceptable  and is harmful to the maintenance of the resources of the sea on which the livelihood of the Icelandic people depends.""In order to strengthen the measures of protection essential to safeguard the vital interests of the Icelandic people in the seas surrounding its coasts  the Government of Iceland now finds it essential to extend further the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around its coasts to include the areas of sea covering the continental shelf. It is contemplated that the new limits  the precise boundaries of which will be furnished at a later date  will enter into force not later than 1 September 1972.""Having regard to the foregoing  the Government of Iceland is prepared  on the basis of the discussions which have already taken place in London  that representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Iceland should meet for the purpose of achieving a practical solution of the problems involved."" 66.	These arguments were reiterated in an aide-memoire of 24 February 1972   with which was enclosed a memorandum entitled ""Fisheries Jurisdiction in Iceland""  where the considerations which led the Government of Iceland to issue the new regulations were set forth. That memorandum has been distributed to all States Members of the United Nations.67.	On 14 April 1972  the Registrar of the International Court of Justice informed me that an application had been filed by the United Kingdom Government in the Registry of the Court instituting proceedings against Iceland on the basis of the Exchange of Notes of 1961  to which I have already referred.68.	In reply  I requested that a number of documents dealing with the background and termination of the agreement referred to and with the changed circumstances resulting from the ever-increasing exploitation of the fishery resources in the seas surrounding Iceland be brought to the attention of the Court. I stated that the danger which this entails for the Icelandic people necessitates further control by the Government of Iceland  the only coastal State concerned.69.	In my letter to the Court I also stated the views of my Government with regard to the Exchange of Notes on the basis of which proceedings before the Court were sought to be instituted. These views are the following.70. The 1961 Exchange of Notes took place under extremely difficult circumstances  when the British Royal Navy had been using force to oppose the 12-mile fishery limit established by the Icelandic Government in 1958. It constituted the settlement of that dispute  but the agreement it recorded was not of a permanent nature. The United Kingdom Government acknowledged the exceptional dependence of the Icelandic people upon coastal fisheries for their livelihood and economic development and recognized the 12-mile fishery zone  subject to an adjustment period of three years. Incidentally  the United Kingdom Government has since adopted a 12-mile fishery zone in British waters. The Icelandic Government  for its part  stated that it would continue to work for the implementation of the Althing resolution of 5 May 1959  regarding the extension of fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland  but would give to the United Kingdom Government six months' notice of such extension  with a possibility of recourse to the International Court of Justice in the event of a dispute in relation to such extension. Thus  the United Kingdom Government was given the opportunity of recourse to the Court should the Icelandic Government without warning further extend the limits immediately or in the near future.71.	The agreement by which that dispute was settled  and consequently the possibility of such recourse to the Court-to which the Government of Iceland has been consistently opposed as far as concerns disputes over the extent of its exclusive fisheries jurisdiction  as indeed the United Kingdom recognizes-was not of a permanent nature. In particular  an undertaking for judicial settlement cannot be considered to be of a permanent nature. There is nothing in that situation  or in any general rule of contemporary international law  to justify any other view.72.	In its aide-memoire of 31 August 1971  as I have already stated  the Government of Iceland  inter alia  gave to the United Kingdom Government 12 months' notice of its intention to extend the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around its coasts to include the areas of sea covering the continental shelf  the precise boundaries of which would be furnished later. It also expressed its willingness to explore possibilities for finding a practical solution to the problems with which the British trawler industry found itself faced. It was specifically stated that the new limits would enter into force not later than 1 September 1972. At the same time it was intimated that the object and purpose of the 1961 agreement had been fully achieved. The position of the Icelandic Government was reiterated in its aide-memoire of 24 February 1972  which again indicated that the 1961 Exchange of Notes was no longer applicable and was terminated. Copies of that aide-memoire were transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice.73.	After the termination of the agreement recorded in the Exchange of Notes of 1961 there was on 14 April 1972  when proceedings were sought to be instituted  no basis under the Statute for the Court to exercise jurisdiction in the case to which the United Kingdom refers.74.	The Government of Iceland  considering that the vital interests of the people of Iceland were involved  respectfully informed the Court that it was not willing to confer jurisdiction on the Court in any case involving the extent of the fishery limits of Iceland  including specifically the case sought to be instituted by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 14 April 1972. Having regard to the foregoing  no agent was appointed to represent the Government of Iceland.75.	It will be seen from the documents to which I have referred that the Government of Iceland does not agree that the International Court of Justice has jurisdiction in the case that the United Kingdom has sought to institute. Nor does my Government consider that the International Court is competent to assess what size of catch might be taken from Icelandic waters by British trawlers without endangering fish stocks in an area over which the Government of Iceland has declared its sovereign rights for fishery purposes. That is a matter for negotiations between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Iceland  and my Government is willing  as I have stated repeatedly  to continue efforts to bring such negotiations to a successful conclusion. Discussions between the representatives of the two Governments will continue next week.76.	I now want to refer to one argument which has been advanced in this matter  namely that the Government of Iceland should not have extended the fishery limits but should have waited for the holding of the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea before doing so. In that connexion I want  to emphasize that my Government has in effect been waiting for almost 25 years for such a solution. It was at this Assembly in 1949 that the delegation of Iceland successfully proposed that the entire body of law of the sea should be taken up for study by the International Law Commission.  That study led to the First and Second United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively x and  although it was not possible there to reach a solution concerning the extent of coastal jurisdiction  it is now hoped that the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea will achieve such results. We most certainly hope so. When we consider that the preparatory work for the Conference shows that an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations already accepts the basic principle that fishery limits should be based on relevant local considerations up to a reasonable extent from the coast  the end may very well be in sight. But it is not certain when that task will be completed. It may still take several years- before a convention is concluded  signed and ratified by a sufficient number of States to enter into effect.77.	In the meantime the Icelandic nation is faced with the fact that its only natural resources may be destroyed by foreign fishing. A working group established by the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has reached the conclusion that the cod fisheries in the North Atlantic should be reduced by 50 per cent. This is a question of life or death. Our conclusion was and is that we could not wait any longer. We could not just sit idly by and watch the collapse of our economy. No accusations of selfishness or of unilateral action can change that fact. Let us all in this Assembly be aware of the fact that rigid rules based on the protection of the interests of distant-water fishing nations in utilizing for themselves the coastal fishery resources of other countries are now no longer sacrosanct. On the contrary  they are obsolete.78.	As far as the International Court of Justice is concerned  I will say that its proper role in the United Nations system is extremely valuable. However  its jurisdiction is limited to cases where consent for jurisdiction has been given and exists. The consent of Iceland to the Court's jurisdiction with regard to fishery limits was given under extremely difficult circumstances. That consent has been terminated and no longer exists.79.	In its order concerning interim measures of protection  the Court states that  on a request for such measures  the Court need not  before indicating them  finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case  although it ought not to act under Article 41 of the Statute if the absence of jurisdiction on the merits is manifest.80.	My Government's view is that the absence of jurisdiction is manifest since its consent no longer existed when the proceedings were sought to be instituted.81.	One of the Judges of the International Court of Justice  Judge Padilla Nervo  reached the conclusion that the Court should not have indicated provisional measures since its jurisdiction had not been established. As to the merits  Judge Padilla Nervo said the following:""The Government of Iceland in its information and documents sent to the Court  has given well-founded reasons and explanations of its sovereign right to extend its fisheries jurisdiction to the entire continental shelf area.""The coastal fisheries in Iceland have always been the foundation of the country's economy.""The coastal fisheries are the condition sine qua non for the Icelandic economy; without them the country would not have been habitable.""Iceland rests on a platform or continental shelf whose outlines follow those of the country itself. In these shallow underwater terraces  ideal conditions are found for spawning areas and nursery grounds upon whose preservation and utilization the livelihood of the nation depends. It is increasingly being recognized that coastal fisheries are based on the special conditions prevailing in the coastal areas which provide the necessary environment for the fish stocks. The environment is an integral part of the natural resources of the coastal State.""The continental shelf is really the platform of the country and must be considered to be a part of the country itself.""The vital interests of the Icelandic people are therefore at stake. They must be protected.""The priority position of the coastal State has then always been recognized through the system of fishery limits. In the past these limits nave to a great extent not been established with any regard to the interests of the coastal State. They owe their origin rather to the preponderant influence of distant-water fishery nations  who wished to fish as close as possible to the shores of other nations  frequently destroying one area and then proceeding to another.""In a system of progressive development of international law the question of fishery limits has to be reconsidered in terms of the protection and utilization of coastal resources regardless of other considerations which apply to the extent of the territorial sea. The international community has increasingly recognized that the coastal fishery resources are to be considered as a part of the natural resources of the coastal State. The special situation of countries who are overwhelmingly dependent on coastal fisheries  was generally recognized at both Geneva Conferences in 1958 and 1960. Since then this view has found frequent expression both in the legislation of various countries and in important political statements. The course of events is decidedly progressing in this direction."" 82.	In conclusion I want to say  with all the conviction at my command  that our vital interests are at stake. We know that a great many nations represented here understand our views. Some of them have taken similar steps to safeguard their own coastal resources. Others have supported our action and are making their own preparations. I want to use this opportunity to thank them for their understanding of the necessity for the Icelandic nation to protect its very existence  its right to live  its right to cultivate its own garden."
"58",3415,"ISR",27,1972,"Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session  and 1 wish Secretary-General Waldheim well as he embarks on his heavy responsibilities.65.	There is much violence in the international air  and the atmosphere of it can be felt in this very hall. But we should not forget that the past year has been fruitful for international conciliation. The main theme has been the victory of dialog. Complexes and taboos which had prevented contact between adversaries have almost everywhere been overcome. We read of meetings and agreements between the United States and the People's Republic of China; between West and East Germany; between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland; between North and South Korea; between the United States and the Soviet Union; between the United States and North Viet-Nam; between the rivals of yesterday who are the partners of today in the European community; and even between India and Pakistan on the very morrow of their armed clash.66.	How improbable all this would have seemed a short time ago! There is a new spirit in international relations. The polemical and rhetorical mood which dominated the past two decades has given way to a strong instinct for conciliation. Hie question that preoccupies nations today is not how they fell into conflict in the past  but how they can live side by side  together  in the future.67.	If we look more deeply into the successes of diplomacy in the past year  we find a strong similarity in the conditions under which they were achieved. These successes have all been secured by direct settlement. They have all been the result of laborious and reticent preparation. They have all been the product of agreement  not of external adjudication. In every single case the pursuit of agreement has had to take place outside the United Nations frame-work.68.	This is of course a significant reflection on the institutional condition of this Organization. It justifies a long hard look at its techniques  its procedures and its atmosphere  which have clearly not been congenial to the craftsmanship of peace. The plain fact is that strident public debate is not a good method of peacemaking but a poor substitute for it. An annual exercise in polemics with preordained voting results either paralyzes conciliation or delays its commencement.69.	I said here last year [1946th meeting] that the Middle East was the only area in which the parties to a conflict were not engaged in a dialog to bring it to an end. That is still the situation. Those who will have to live together side by side in our region have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. This is a primary source of deadlock. In all other international disputes the breakthrough has come on the level of communication  and not through substantive commitments ahead of negotiation. The very decision of governments to make contact with each other creates a dynamic of its own. It transforms the context of their relationships and leads to mutual adjustment of their positions and thereafter towards binding agreements.70.	Despite this central disappointment  the Middle Eastern scene has not become darker in the past year. The cease-fire has been maintained. There seems to be less feasibility for full-scale hostilities. Despite deplorable slogans about ""inevitable struggle""  it is clear that resumed fighting would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The retirement of Soviet forces and equipment from Egypt has stripped the conflict of its dangerous global dimension. Powers outside the Middle East cannot solve our region's problems; they have not fought its wars and they will not build its peace. The idea of a settlement imposed from outside has become visibly weaker. It is explicitly rejected by some of the Powers; and the summit meeting between the leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in May 1972 revealed what an illusory prospect it is. Once it becomes generally understood that a military solution is not feasible and that an imposed solution is excluded by the international realities of our times  a negotiated peace will emerge as the only valid alternative. The central aim of our policy is to create this consciousness: we aspire to break out of deadlock into a new vision and a new hope.71.	The developments in Egypt during July 1972 made it natural for the Israeli Government to restate its positions on a negotiated peace. Our ambition is to see an end of belligerency and conflict and to advance towards a peaceful future. Negotiation is not an act of ""humiliation"" or ""surrender"" for anybody  as some Arab leaders have said. It is a supreme assertion of national sovereignty and of international responsibility. Courage in leadership does not belong to the battlefield alone; it can be put to the service of conciliation and peace.72.	In maintaining the cease-fire positions until peace is obtained  we do not seek to perpetuate the cease-fire lines or to freeze the existing situation for ever. Our proposals for permanent boundaries to be established for the first time between Israel and its Arab neighbors will be determined by the need to ensure security and to prevent new wars such as that which arose from the fragile and vulnerable armistice lines of 1967. The construction of a stable peace and security between Israel and Egypt requires a precise  detailed negotiation on territorial delimitation.73.	The deadlock on the over-all settlement in this sector arises from the fact that Egypt has so far refused to begin negotiation unless its position on the final outcome is conceded in advance. There is no valid precedent for such an approach. Negotiation creates the final result; the final result does not create negotiation. We seek no binding commitments from Egypt in advance on matters that are subject to negotiation. We have not sought to determine the final peace boundary  and we have drawn no alternative maps.74.	It is unlikely that a transition from complete deadlock to complete peace can be made in one stage. Accordingly  the Israeli Government through its Prime Minister reiterated on 27 July this year its readiness to negotiate a special Suez Canal agreement. Such an accord would be a contribution and a stimulus to an over-all peace. We would consider such an arrangement as a temporary solution and as a step towards peace. In the atmosphere of confidence created by such an agreement  a momentum for further accords would be generated.75.	It is far-fetched to assert that the positions which I have briefly outlined today offer Arab Governments no possibility of honorable and meaningful negotiation. These principles correspond to the norms of international conciliation. What is required is the application to theMiddle East of the spirit and method that have had successful results elsewhere.76.	The lack of Egyptian response so far to Israel's willingness to negotiate a temporary Suez agreement has long been an obstacle to progress. So  too  is the deadlock created by Cairo's insistence on determining the boundary and withdrawal issues before and without negotiation. In addition  a new massive barrier to peace has arisen through the resurgence of the Arab terrorist outrages which have sent a shock of revulsion through the civilized world.77.	The story seems unending. Only a few hours ago  the heroes of the Arab liberation movement handed a transistor radio to a woman passenger about to embark on an airliner from Paris to Israel  with hundreds of passengers. It contained a heavy explosive charge. The passenger showed the vigilance necessary to transmit it to the security authorities. The moral qualities of this terrorism come to expression here.78.	When the Secretary-General decided to request the inclusion in the agenda of an item on international terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l]  he was giving a correct and perceptive interpretation of his rights and duties under the Charter. Organized groups of terrorists  for whom violence is both a means and an end  are threatening the texture of international life. Innocent civilians live in fear of attack by murder squads from abroad. The airlines work in an atmosphere of vulnerability. The international mails are violated by the assaults of cowardly men whose malice knows no compassion and no restraint.79.	There are many forms and varieties of terrorist violence. They spread like a contagious germ. They respond to destructive and nihilist impulses that have taken root in contemporary culture. And the ultimate arrogance of the terrorists is not that they perform their outrages  but that they then ask for understanding and endorsement. They base their assault on the proposition that all restraints  civilities  immunities and human solidarities must be sacrificed to what they unilaterally proclaim to be their ""rights"". When they endanger the principles of international order  such as the sovereignty of States  the legal systems of free societies  the universal freedom of the air  the physical safety of men and women who handle the international mail  then the United Nations would lose all credit and repute if its Secretary-General were not to focus its attention and conscience on the approaching abyss.80.	It is disquieting that the inclusion of the item in the agenda was so strongly opposed that it was nearly lost. Civilized mankind should take a keen look at the Governments which opposed the inclusion of the item or advocated its long postponement. The truth is that their Organization came within a few votes of moral death last week. And the Foreign Minister of Brazil was perfectly right in deploring the General Assembly's failure to endorse the wording of the item as recommended by the General Committee [2038th meeting]. Once the deliberate and unprovoked murder of unarmed civilians is justified by reference to the murderers' ""motives"" or ""frustrations""  we might as well include murder amongst the legitimate indulgences of a permissive society and wipe the sixth commandment off the tablet of man's ethical history.81.	The Israeli delegation will support the draft resolution presented by the United States [A/C.6/L.851] and will give careful study in an affirmative spirit to the text proposed for an international convention against terrorism [A/C.6/ L.850].82.	But while the problem has its international aspects  especially in aviation and in police security  much depends on the willingness of individual Governments to take measures of prevention on their own soil. The terrorists are particularly active on the territory of free democratic States in which tolerance and hospitality are cherished values. It thus becomes painfully necessary for such States to develop habits of sharp detection and action which are  in a sense  contrary to their easy temperament. But a free society cannot long survive if it fails to defend itself against those who would destroy its freedom and menace its survival by illicit violence. Similarly  many a government must face a moment of agonizing truth when it is called upon to judge the results of giving the terrorists what they want under the threat of dreadful blackmail. To withstand hijackers and kidnappers requires very strong nerves. A compromise convenient for the short term will usually have the effect of giving terrorism a new lease of strength  thereby endangering more victims than are immediately at stake.83.	In addition to the need for international and national action there is an important area for regional co-operation. The terrorists have made the liberal societies of Western Europe the main arena of their activities. It is here that the majority of outrages against vulnerable aircraft and civilian establishments have taken place. We attach importance and interest to the discussion initiated by the Federal Republic of Germany at the Council of the European Community a few weeks ago regarding measures to combat international terrorism.84.	My Government has considered certain specific concrete proposals for international  regional and national measures to combat terrorism and we shall bring them forward at the appropriate Committee stage.85.	It is of course right and inevitable that the item on our agenda [item 92] should be drafted in universal terms. It would  however  be mere pretense to lose sight of the fact that the most rampant terrorism today is that which has its root in Arab hostility to Israel. It was after all the ghastly crime at Munich that gave the incentive for the debate which the General Assembly has decided to hold.86.	In this context I come to discuss the methods used by Arab terrorist organizations; their political aims; and  above all  the crucial role of Arab Governments in creating and maintaining them.87.	The original targets of Arab terrorism in the early 1950s were the lives and homes of Israelis on their own soil. The toll was heavy and constant. A bus load of passengers at Scorpion Pass; a group of farmers celebrating a wedding at Patish; a party of scholars on an archaeological expedition at Ramat Rachel; farmers in the collective villages of the Jordan Valley; fishermen on Lake Tiberias. These are random extracts from our nation's memory of bereavement. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual security. A United Nations representative  General E. L. M. Burns of Canada  wrote then of these fedayeen activities that they were worthy of the Nazis. In those days murder was not regarded anywhere as a symptom of revolutionary ""progress"".88.	The terrorist bands called the ""fedayeen""  which  thereafter  became the ""Palestine Liberation Organization""  developed their main activity in the 1950s and the early 1960s. In other words  they have absolutely nothing to do with the situation created by the 1967 war. Their object has been and is to destroy security of life for Israel  irrespective of what the armistice or cease-fire configuration is at any given time. After 1967 they transferred their violence from frontier areas to Israel's urban centers; shoppers in Mahne Yehuda Market in Jerusalem; housewives in a supermarket; students in a college cafeteria; passers-by in a crowded bus station-and on one horrifying morning a clearly marked school bus at Avivim in Northern Israel. As the mangled bodies of our children  still clutching toys and copybooks  were flown by helicopter to hospitals and morgues  there came across the frontier the gloating voice of Mr. George Habash  Commander of the so-called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  announcing that it was wise to kill Israelis while they were still young. It is difficult to speak or hear of this morbid monster without a cold chill of revulsion. The essential point for these ""liberators"" is that their victims should be defenseless  vulnerable and unarmed. This is their chivalry.89.	The rest is part of the recent experience and memory of everyone in this hall. Before the squalid butchery at Munich  the worst horror was at Lod Airport  where a group of depraved mercenaries from a distant land methodically slaughtered 26 civilian passengers-one of them was an eminent Israeli physicist  others were humble Puerto Rican pilgrims coming from the United States. Condemnation was world-wide; but alas it was not universal. Those who take their weekly instruction from the cultivated prose of Hassanein Heykal should ponder his commentary on the massacre at Lod. I quote from an article by him dated 9 June 1972:""If there had been three Palestinians there instead of three Japanese I should have been enthusiastic about it  in spite of the fact that at the bottom of my heart I'm for the three Japanese.""90.	The Egyptian Prime Minister's reaction was less sophisticated and more simple  although it had a note of blasphemy. He invoked divine blessing on the murderous example:""I want to say that what happened at Lod Airport proves that we can  with Allah's help  achieve victory in our battle with Israel. This is the only reaction I have to this matter.""91.	In the history of revolutionary violence there is a constant clash between ends and means. But in the Arab terrorist movement  dedicated to enslavement and genocide  there is no such ambivalence. The aims which Arab terrorism serves are even worse than the means it employs. The means are murder and kidnapping. The aim is not to win freedom for the Arab nation  whose freedom is soamply and lavishly assured  but to liquidate the national? liberation which the most ancient of nations has already achieved.92.	There is no need of interpretation here. Quotation is enough. The Palestine terrorist organizations are not at all concerned with finding a solution for the problems of Palestinian Arabs within the framework of a Middle East of which Israel forms a part. This  in fact  is what they are fighting to prevent. The aim is much more radical. Let their leader  Yasser Arafat  speak for himself:""Al Fatah started its activities in 1956 and its armed struggle in 1965. Its aim is the liquidation of the Zionist Israeli existence.""President El-Sadat is often very frank on this theme. On 2 June 1971 he told the Egyptian National Council:""The Zionist conquest to which we are being subjected will not be terminated by the return of the occupied territories. This is a new Crusader war which will persist during our generation and through the coming one.""93.	A document called the Palestine Covenant was adopted by all the Palestine liberation groups at the sixth congress of the Palestinian National Council  which met in Cairo in September 1968. The Covenant lays down that the Palestine State is to be an Arab State  that it is to comprise the whole area west of the Jordan not part of it  and that only Jews who were living in Palestine before the ""Zionist invasion"" could be citizens. The rest -the vast majority- would be pressed to depart. So the aim of this terrorist movement is the liquidation of the solitary Israeli State for the purpose of establishing the nineteenth Arab State. A compact expression of this policy came from former Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad in a press conference in Paris on 1 October 1971  when he said: ""I give complete support to the organizations and their program of wiping out the Jewish State.""94.	The concept of ""politicide""-the extinction of the identity and personality of a State-is so unfamiliar  indeed unique  that it may be difficult for other Governments to grasp its significance. Israelis study this notion against the background of another unique experience  the memory of which no other people has ever shared. In the Hitler decade we learned that some things are too terrible to believe but that nothing in our people's history is too terrible to have happened.95.	In questioning Israel's axiomatic right to security and independence  the terrorist organizations commit a disruptive heresy in the life of our age. They rise up in revolt against history  law  justice  humanity and peace. There are now 18 Arab States  with a population of 100 million  an area of 4-1/2 million square miles and unlimited wealth and opportunity. Facing them alone on the scales of equity is the small State of Israel. There is  therefore  only one nation which stands or falls in history by the way in which this conflict is resolved. By-its solitude and uniqueness  Israel's secure existence is the overriding moral imperative in this dispute. The moral quality of the Arab terrorist organizations is determined not only by their brutal acts but by the destructive vision which inspires them. Theirclose links with neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations are in full harmony with their inner nature.96.	I have said that the resurgence of Arab terrorism is a massive obstacle or the road to peace. This is not only a reflection on the psychological atmosphere. *t is true that a condition of hate  fear  bloodshed and bereavement works against the prospect of a conciliatory effort  which would be difficult enough in any case. What is no less grave is tha we find it impossible to accept the distinction between these organizations and the Arab Governments which are our destined partners in the peace effort. The support given by those Governments to the organizations undermines the credibility of their peaceful professions and even the professions are few and far between.97.	Egyptian support for the terrorists finds expression in the press  radio and television. The terrorist leaders see Cairo as the center at which they co-ordinate matters of common concern with the League of Arab States. Egypt serves as the center where the heads of the terrorist movements meet the representatives of the various Arab countries passing through Cairo. Not a week passes without a central Egyptian personality meeting with a terrorist leader for co-ordination and co-operation. Cairo Radio gives a special program on Palestine in which terrorist activities are constantly praised. The special radio station broadcasting from Cairo  called ""Saut Falastin""  belongs entirely to the terrorists  who are free to broadcast what they like. The station broadcasts constant agitation and incitement against Israel and justifies every terrorist action.98.	Egyptian support on the military level is very broad. On many occasions delegations of the organizations with Arafat at their head pay visits to Egyptian army camps in the rear and at the front. Arafat wears an Egyptian army decoration for valor.99.	The terrorist organizations are permitted to carry on activity everywhere in the country to mobilize volunteers. Apart from their own independent mobilization machinery  they receive active support in this respect from the Libyan Embassy in Cairo  which openly signs up volunteers  pays them and sends them to Libya for training.100.	Delegations from the various terrorist organizations receive information and instruction in Egyptian military bases. The Fatah stands apart from the rest and has special privileges in Egypt. Its members actually go through training together with Egyptian soldiers in the ranks of the Egyptian army. The ""Ein Jalud"" unit of the Palestine Liberation Army is commanded by an Egyptian officer. Egypt also helps the organizations with supplies of arms  ammunition and other military material.101.	The crisis that broke out between Lebanon and the terrorists in June 1972 brought to the fore Egypt's role as guardian and protector of the organizations. Realizing that the terrorist movement might find itself obliged to quit Lebanese territory  the Egyptian President took action to forestall any Lebanese attempt to harm the terrorists. Mahmoud Riad  Secretary of the League of Arab States  was sent as a special mediator. President El-Sadat was not content with that. He sent his personal representative to Beirut in order to exert pressure on the Lebanese Government not to cancel the Cairo agreement of November 1969  which provided for the terrorists' presence in Lebanon.102.	Egypt's leaders address the terrorist bodies at all their conferences. In any clash between the terrorists and their victims  the Government sponsors the terrorists' cause. In September 1970 a Pan American aircraft landed in Cairo  where the hijackers calmly blew it up in the sight of the authorities. When the Jordanian Defense Minister was murdered as a guest on Egyptian soil  his hosts allowed the murderers to go free.103.	In Lebanon there are 5 000 terrorists  whose constant activity is undisturbed by the authorities. Under the Cairo agreement between Lebanon and the terrorist organizations  the Lebanese Government granted the terrorists legal recognition  freedom to organize and a base for activity against Israel. Beirut is the seat and center of terrorist planning and propaganda. It is from Beirut that groups set out with detailed plans to commit murder and hijackings and set off explosions in Europe and elsewhere. It was in Beirut and Baalbek that Kozo Okamoto received shelter and training for his assault on the airport at Lod.104.	Syria was the first Arab State which supported terrorist activities from the outset. President Al-Assad said on 2 September 1971 in the weekly journal Al Mussawar that:""... the fedayeen are to be found in more than one area of Syria  and they have absolute freedom of movement on the Syrian front. Moreover ""-said President Al-Assad-""we encourage and stimulate them and often we complain that they are not sufficiently active . . ."".105.	Libyan support for terrorist assaults in the Middle East and Europe needs no documentation. President Qaddafi's admiration of the Munich murderers was rhapsodic and explicit.106.	Whatever the position may be with other terrorist groups  there is no truth or value in a discussion of Arab terrorism which does not face the fact that it is a recognized arm of Arab Governments in a policy of war against Israel. These organizations could not exist  still less function  without the shelter  support  endorsement  financial aid  arms  training facilities and territorial bases supplied by certain Arab States. All the activities of these organizations without exception violate the principles which the signatories of the Charter including Arab signatories-pledged themselves to defend. It is not an accident that the Governments which sponsor Arab terrorist organizations are unable to fulfill normal international obligations. The Arab Governments have not signed the Tokyo Convention;  they have not signed the Montreal Convention;? they have not responded to the Secretary-General's proposal for drawing the attention of the twenty-seventh session of this Assembly to the problem of international terrorism [A/8791 andAdd.lJ.107.	Now. whether or not the General Assembly can take effective action in this matter  it does at least possess the capacity of accurate judgment. Such honorable words as ""liberation""  ""resistance""  ""commando"" have no application and have never before been applied to attempts to liquidate a lawful sovereignty  to compound the Nazi assault on Jewish survival and to wage a campaign of indiscriminate assault against civilians in the Middle East and elsewhere.108.	The attitude of Arab Governments towards Arab terrorists is today a graver obstacle to peace than the admittedly disparate positions of the parties to the problems of withdrawal  boundaries  navigation  peace  etc. I say in all frankness: I cannot today believe that Egypt and Syria are willing  or that Lebanon is able  to make peace with Israel; and in that profound skepticism the attitude of those movements to terrorism plays the central role.109.	The discussion must inevitably take us back to a consideration of the word ""Palestine"" that appears as the title of the terrorist organizations. Now  is it true that there is a distinct people deprived of self-determination  languishing in poverty  squalor and humiliation  dependent on organized violence as its sole prospect of redemption? Nothing could be further from the truth.110.	There are some 2-3/4 million Palestine Arabs in the world today. Three quarters of them are in the original territory of Palestine  on both sides of the Jordan that is to say  under Jordanian rule or within the area at present under Israel's jurisdiction. The other quarter are in Kuwait  Lebanon  Syria and Saudi Arabia. Moreover  1 300 000 Palestine Arabs now hold Jordanian citizenship  which has been available to them since 1950  when Jordan annexed the territories of the west bank with the consent of the Palestinian leaders.111.	For the entire period of the armistice regime between 1949 and 1967 all Palestine Arabs-except a few hundred thousand who are citizens of Israel were living under Arab sovereignty and Arab flags. In other words  the question of their civic and political identity was a matter for determination by Arab Governments and authorities alone.112.	The Kingdom of Jordan was a Palestinian State  in the double sense that a majority of its citizens were Palestinians and a majority of all the Palestinians in the world were citizens of that State.113.	In a final peace settlement a new permanent boundary will be drawn between Israel and its eastern neighbor. Some hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs would in all conditions be a community within the State of Israel; this is normal. There is no such thing as 100 per cent self- determination  although the Arab nation comes closer to that figure than any other in history. Those Palestinian Arabs who will be outside Israel's permanent boundary once it is drawn will be free to determine their future in conjunction with the Arab Governments and peoples concerned.114.	As recently as 8 September 1972  the Israeli Prime Minister made it plain that in her conception of a peace agreement there would have to be important modifications of the previous armistice lines in order to preserve security and to avoid new wars. But she added that it was not her conception that under such an agreement the vast majority of all the Palestine Arabs in the administered territories would have to fall within Israeli jurisdiction.115.	It follows  therefore  that the political status of the Palestine Arabs would find its solution within a peace settlement. Now  here is the most drastic paradox of all: the ""Palestine Liberation"" organizations are the implacable opponents of an Arab peace with Israel. Yet nothing but peace with Israel can clarify the political and civil destiny of the Palestine Arabs in a manner compatible with Israel's sovereignty and security  with regional peace and with their own basic interests.116.	In the meantime  this community is not languishing in despair and poverty: there is a new freedom of movement and contact. The national product of the Samaria-Judea-Gaza areas  administered by Israel since 1967  in which a million Arabs live  has nearly doubled since 1968. The per capita income has risen from £1 670 in 1968 to £1 1 100 in 1972. The agricultural product has tripled. There were less than 4 000 private vehicles in 1969; there are nearly 7 000 today. There were 3 000 television sets there in 1967; today there are 40 000. Fifty thousand workers find labor opportunities in the Israeli market  from which they bring back £ 1300 million a year. There is no unemployment. Wage levels have trebled since 1967. The value of exports from these territories has risen from £ 1220 million to £ 1305 million.117.	Perhaps more significant than the language of statistics is the spectacle of human contact  commerce and exchange that brings hundreds of thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs into a normal and fruitful communion the like of which never existed before.118.	In the latter half of 1971  200 000 Arabs from neighboring countries freely crossed the Jordan bridges towards Israel. It is not inconceivable that  when the agreed peace boundary is drawn  the relations between Israel and its eastern Arab neighbors could evolve across open boundaries into something like the community structure in parts of Western Europe today.119.	So while Arab terrorists in Beirut and European capitals manufacture their bombs and plot their assassinations  the majority of the Palestinian Arabs are living solid lives enriched by a widening contact with their neighbors still clouded  of course  by a lack of political definition  but nevertheless alive with the hope and prospect of a peaceful regional future.120.	There is  of course  hardship in every sector of Middle Eastern life. But there is not one single problem of the Palestinian Arabs that can be advanced towards a solution by the action of the terrorist groups. There is not one single legitimate interest of the Palestinian Arabs that would not come to reasonable satisfaction in a negotiated peace settlement between Israel and its neighbors. The terrorist groups are not only the enemies of law and order across the Middle East and in many parts of the world: they also alienate the Palestine Arabs from their true interest and their authentic vocation.121.	The problem of curbing the terrorists is now our most urgent preoccupation. We are resolved to resist and weaken them in our region. We believe that national  regional and international action against Arab terrorism is an indispensable prelude to the fruitful exploration of peaceful prospects for the Middle East.122.	I have spoken of psychological and human obstacles on the road to peace. Some of these obstacles could easiK be removed. I refer  for example  to the problem of prisoners of war.123.	There are 10 Israeli prisoners of war in Egyptian hands; they have been there for two and a half to three years. On the other hand  Israel holds 61 Egyptian prisoners of war  most of whom have been in captivity for nearly three years. Syria has been holding three Israeli prisoners of war for the last two and a half years. Israel holds 45 Syrian prisoners of war. Israel also holds 10 Lebanese prisoners of war.124.	With the cease-fire well into its third year we propose the mutual release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. The arithmetical advantage is overwhelmingly on the Arab side; but in the broader human sense everyone would gain.125.	The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 lays down in article 118 that: ""Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities."" This provision of the Geneva Convention is clear and definite. In accordance with it there should have been a release of prisoners when the cease-fire entered into force on 7 August 1970.126.	Articles 109 and 110 of the Convention provide that prisoners of war who are seriously wounded or who are seriously sick must be sent back to their own country even before the cessation of active hostilities.127.	It is reported that Egypt considers the six pilots amongst the Israeli prisoners that it has captured as being of greater importance than the 60 Egyptian prisoners held by Israel  who are mostly ordinary soldiers. But this is certainly not a humane approach to the problem. All prisoners of war  irrespective of rank  must be released in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Geneva Convention. A gesture of goodwill by Egypt and Syria on behalf of 115 Arabs and 13 Israeli prisoners would help diminish the acute lack of confidence which now obstructs any progress towards peace. What valid argument can there possibly be against this course?128.	At the same time our Jewish destiny and responsibility inspire our concern for the plight of the small Jewish minority in Syria where 4 500 Jews are held as helpless hostages  forbidden to depart  discriminated against  humiliated  their movement restricted  essential services denied them  their property confiscated  and their livelihood in constant jeopardy.129.	The plight of Syrian Jewry has been brought to the United Nations General Assembly and its Committees in the past. Two years ago committees to help the Jews of the Arab countries arose in 25 different countries in four continents  and an international committee came into existence. Some of the Arab countries responded to the humanitarian pressure of world public opinion and permitted the Jews who had remained in their territories to leave. Only Syria has persisted in its present position. Public opinion should not rest or remain silent until the imprisoned are released and the Jews of Syria permitted to reach safety.130.	Year in and year out the problem of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union comes to the General Assembly and its Committees.131.	The history of the Jews in Russia is a continuous chain of hardship and suffering from the days of the Tsars until the present time. Recently their urgent aspiration to emigrate to their historic homeland has broken through the barrier of silence. Thousands have reached Israel  where they have been received with a deep poignancy arising from a long separation. Many people of goodwill throughout the world saw in the emigration of these Jews  however few  a sign of broader tolerance and humane understanding.132.	But there has now been a setback; while still permitting the emigration of thousands of Jews  the Soviet authorities have placed limitations on the freedom of movement of scores of thousands in disregard of their fundamental human rights. Many have been arrested just for wishing to go to Israel and have been sentenced to imprisonment. The Soviet information media publish calumnies  slanders and incitement against them.133.	Many of those who register in the emigration offices are dismissed from employment and thus lose their livelihood. An open anti-Semitic campaign is being conducted  and in the period 1971-1972 alone  dozens of anti-Semitic books have been published in the Soviet Union  in addition to the anti-Jewish campaign conducted by the press and official media of information.134.	And now as part of the attempt to dissuade Jews from submitting applications for exit permits to Israel  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics decided on 3 August to impose a special tax on Jews with higher education who wish to go to Israel. This effectively deprives thousands of people of any possibility and any hope ever to join their families and to realize their national aspiration. A scale has been established for each level of education  sometimes reaching $25 000 and more per person.135.	It seems to us that the Soviet argument on the brain drain is not relevant or applicable here. The Soviet Union is not one of the needy developing countries  and Israel is not offering Jewish members of the scientific professions who come from the Soviet Union superior financial rewards. Israel is only able to give them a home  where they will feel as Jews who are not being discriminated against.136.	Likewise irrelevant is the argument that graduates are obliged  as it were  to repay the cost of their education.137.	The noted Soviet demographer  Urlanis  states in an article published on 26 July 1970 in Literaturnaya Gazeta that  in the conditions obtaining in the Soviet Union  the average university graduate repays by four years' work the State's investment in his training. The majority of scientists have thus already repaid that investment many times over by their creativity  their invention  their research and their professional work. The decree is not only a harassment of thousands of Jews  it is a serious infringement of intellectual freedom and scientific liberty. It creates the enslavement of scientists and intellectuals whose only crime is that they have studied and worked and contributed to the progress of their country  and today obey the call of their historic consciousness and wish to pursue their intellectual and social vocation elsewhere.138.	Scientific personalities and institutions across the world have reacted with astonishment and indignation to this limitation of intellectual freedom. It is precisely because we wish to see a greater harmony between East and West  between the Soviet Union and the West  in all fields  including that of science  that we raise our voice in protest against this superfluous obstacle to international understanding.139.	The General Assembly moves towards its agenda in an atmosphere of crisis for international institutions. There was never a time when a universal framework for international relations was more objectively necessary than today. Yet the concept of international organization is still surrounded by apathy and doubt. The United Nations should act with consistent purpose within the real limits of its capacity and strength. It should reinforce its role in international development in the light of the difficulties and dislocations revealed at the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago. It should take a careful course on the problems of the environment which were impressively brought to light at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in June. We must not allow an exaggerated ecological alarmist to act as a brake on accelerated development: for poverty and backwardness in most of the world have a more polluting effect on the life of our age than the excesses of industrialization in a small part of it. We should complete it universality by the admission of Bangladesh to membership. And we must not discredit our protest against racial discrimination in the southern parts of Africa by a craven silence about the brutal and capricious persecution of Asians undertaken by the present ruler of Uganda. The distribution of tasks and responsibilities between sovereign Governments and international institutions requires a delicate exercise in understanding. The United Nations must become an instrument for solving conflicts  not an arena for waging them. It should take a diplomatic  not a parliamentary view. Its task is to provide and promote consensus and agreement  not to take refuge in illusions of enforcement or adjudication. If we temper ambition with restraint we may yet endow this Organization with a constructive purpose and enlarge its humane role in the history of our turbulent age."
"59",3462,"ITA",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is a privilege for me to extend to you  on behalf of the Italian Government  my congratulations and good wishes. I am addressing not only a distinguished statesman but the representative of a noble people to which the Italians feel very close  sharing with it many traditions and the same deep love of peace. In recalling the important work performed by this Assembly last year under the guidance of your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  I am certain that the results of the current session will prove just as fruitful.59.	I wish to assure the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  of my sincere appreciation of the dedication with which he has undertaken his difficult task in the service of the Organization. He knows that he can rely on the support of my Government in carrying out his high mission as the faithful interpreter of the spirit of the Charter.60.	The speakers who have preceded me have referred to the expectations and anxieties of their peoples  but it seems to me that the most significant note which has resounded up to now in this world Assembly has been a note of hope.61.	In spite of persistent conflicts and selfish nationalisms  in spite of the unleashing of violence no longer restrained by national or international law  we all feel that a relaxation of tension in international relations is taking place.62.	Let me first have a look at Asia  where the worst conflict of the last 25 years is still raging  but where we now note some encouraging symptoms. Two great peoples  the Chinese and the Japanese  are trying to bridge the gulf which has separated them in recent times. This is an event which can greatly contribute to a better and more stable international community. North and South Korea are moving towards the normalization of their relations and we hope that nothing will interfere with these new and promising developments. In the Asian subcontinent  the way is now open to negotiations; if that path is followed with farsightedness  it will be possible to re-establish harmony among the States of that huge area to the benefit of the whole international community. In this spirit we hope that we may soon welcome Bangladesh in our midst.63.	The recent developments in Europe are bound to give a decisive contribution to the stability of the old continent and  therefore  of the whole international order. The Community  which the Western European countries are building  is undergoing a process of strengthening and enlargement. It is and will remain a commonwealth of free peoples  founded on the heritage of a common civilization and on a common conception of democracy  social progress and the dignity of man. This association of States is and will remain open to co-operation with the rest of the world.64.	The European Community intends to live up to its responsibilities in so far as its relations with other States  and in particular with the developing countries  are concerned. One of the most important issues to be discussed at the forthcoming summit meeting in-Paris  next October  will be a plan for co-operation with the latter countries. The European Community intends to honor the commitments which it has undertaken in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the development of trade within the framework of a system of generalized preferences.65.	One of the main goals of the Community is the gradual closing  through a realistic and constructive dialog  of the gap which has divided Europe during the last 25 years. The Community is attempting to set up new relations  based on the recognition of reality  on mutual trust and on the free exchange of people  information and ideas. If  as we hope  the outcome of the negotiations now going on in order to normalize the relations between the two States of the German nation is a positive one  an important obstacle on the way to European co-operation will be removed.66. Further momentum for this process will be provided by the conference for security and co-operation in Europe. In this spirit  we are working towards the adequate preparation of that conference.67.	But Europe cannot feel secure unless there is peace also in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately  the ghost of war is still looming over the Near East  and the resolutions of the United Nations have so far remained in the limbo of good intentions.68.	Furthermore  despite the appeals made to the parties directly involved in the conflict we are now witnessing a resumption of violence which threatens to get out of hand. That tension is the result of a lack of progress in working out a just solution to the conflict in that region. It is the duty of the United Nations to encourage the parties- as well as the Powers which wield some influence in that area to act in such a way that a just solution may be found. We maintain that the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts is the most valid way to a lasting settlement in the area.69.	The easing of tension necessarily involves the problem of disarmament. I should therefore like to stress the interest which my Government has always attached to this important issue  so essential for the strengthening of peace.70.	We are deeply committed to the objectives of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and we express the hope that when it resumes its work the important negotiations undertaken by it will achieve positive results. We equally trust that the resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks will bring about fruitful results.71.	Finally  we welcomed with interest the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference. Such an initiative will be all the more effective if it is supported by the general membership of the United Nations  including all the nuclear Powers  and if it is accurately prepared by an adequately representative organ.72.	Meanwhile  proposals have been submitted which are designed to limit arguments on a regional scale. We think that they should be viewed in the framework of the general balance of forces. Such regional initiatives  therefore  will benefit from the institution of machinery like the world disarmament conference.73.	We can therefore hope that we are on the threshold of further progress towards detente. However  we must do what is necessary to prevent the setting up of a new pattern of international relations from taking place at the expense of freedom for peoples and independence for nations. The emergence of new Powers on the world scene should be accompanied by the increasingly responsible participation of all countries in the life of the international community.74.	Our Assembly  which last year finally welcomed in its midst the representatives of the great Chinese people  should give its utmost attention to this problem. Another important step is likely to be taken towards the universality of the United Nations. We do hope that the two German States will successfully conclude their negotiations and thus be able to join our Organization.75.	For other so-called divided States the way to membership in the United Nations is still difficult. However  the negotiations in progress between the two Koreas raise some hope. Some better prospects arise also from the confirmed determination of the United States Government to withdraw all its troops from Viet-Nam. I should like to express in this Assembly the good wishes of the Italian people and Government to the Vietnamese people  so sorely tried by the horrors of war. I do hope that in the near future all the peoples of Indochina will be able to devote themselves  in security and independence  to the rehabilitation of their countries.76.	The full attainment of the objectives of decolonization  solemnly and repeatedly voiced in this Assembly  will open the doors of the United Nations to some new peoples that are still yearning for independence. The Italian Government confirms its full adherence to this goal. We are convinced that we must facilitate  in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with its provisions  the historical process which will wipe out the last vestiges of colonialism  especially in the African continent.77.	The foresight of the founding fathers made the United Nations flexible enough to enable it after more than a quarter of a century to deal with previously unforeseen problems  such as those of the developing countries  of the technological and scientific gap and of the protection of the environment. However  no one can deny the fact that  on the issue of the maintenance of peace and security  international reality has followed a course different from that advocated in 1945  thus partly frustrating the original expectations.78.	While the great Powers were slowly moving from a ""balance of terror"" to a dialog which was the product of the so-called ""balance of caution""  the members of the international community were increasing in number and new centers of influence were rising. These new centers  thanks to the great contribution they can make to economic and cultural development  should be enabled to participate more fully in the system of collective security established by the Charter.79.	The Italian Government has repeatedly stated to this Assembly its point of view on the matter of international security.80.	Peace-keeping requires  besides measures to avoid possible conflicts or to settle those that already exist  a global commitment for the gradual removal of the deeper and sometimes old causes of conflict. We must include among these causes all kinds of interference in international affairs  any limitation of sovereignty or any attempt to limit the freedom of each people to choose the regime under which it wants to live. If in some continents these ills are the remnants of the colonial policy of the past  in others they are the consequence of power politics.81.	Our commitment must be further directed against serious violations of human rights. Genocide  racial discrimination and political persecution  so much more unacceptable when carried out with the appearance of legality  are a permanent threat to peace.82.	The search for peace must aim at reducing the economic imbalance which separates countries and obstructs the path towards an effective equality among men of different races.83.	We must therefore strive to promote broader observance of international law. This can be obtained by strengthening the means for the peaceful settlement of international disputes  by enhancing the role of the International Court of Justice  by developing and codifying international law and by creating effective peacekeeping instruments of the United Nations. There is also the need to solve the serious problems arising from both terrorism and retaliation  which produce so many innocent victims in various parts of the world. In this respect  we listened with interest to the proposal of the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Rogers [2038th meeting]  and we shall carefully study the draft convention submitted to this Assembly [A/C.6/L.850]. We are ready to co-operate in drawing up a text of a resolution which could meet with wide approval.84.	We think it is our duty to ask ourselves whether the structure of the United Nations can fulfill the Organization's present tasks. The Italian Government believes that  while fully respecting the purposes and principles of the Charter as they stand  some structures of our Organization must be adjusted to the new realities and to the new requirements which have arisen during the past 25 years. As was pointed out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil  Mr. Gibson Barboza  when he opened the general debate:""It is beyond question  in our view  that the participation of the medium-sized and small Powers would be highly constructive and creative; it would be tantamount to an infusion of new blood  which might serve to heal the sclerosis of structures that have aged apparently without being aware of it."" [2038th meeting  para. 19.]85.	In this connexion the Secretary-General noted in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that collective security should not be based only on the agreement of a few Powers [A/8701/Add.l  p. 2]. We must go beyond the image of the United Nations as the ""warden of peace"" and strive for a United Nations capable of eradicating the basic causes of international tension  of harmonizing opposing interests and of creating better standards of living for all peoples.86.	Furthermore  a new approach to the problems concerning peace and security requires the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. Its capacity for furthering the aims of the United Nations in the field of economic development  of social progress and of the protection of human rights must become more incisive.87.	We also consider that the responsibilities within our Organization should be better distributed  taking into account the contribution which each Member country can make  commensurate with its capacity  towards the achievement of the objectives I have indicated.88.	The world undoubtedly owes much to the sense of responsibility shown by the great military Powers. But the concept of peace and security which I mentioned earlier implies that the time has come for other countries to share world responsibilities. I am referring to countries which  although they are not-and choose not to be-nuclear Powers  can still make substantial contributions to the maintenance of peace  since they are in a position to promote and advance the economic  social  scientific  technical and cultural progress of mankind. It was therefore with satisfaction that we heard Mr. Rogers say in his statement to the Assembly that:""... we believe that for the Security Council to maintain its influence and authority  ways must be found to ensure the representation of States  other than the present permanent members . . . whose resources and influence are of major importance in world affairs."" [2038th meeting  para. 64.]My country hopes that such a constructive approach will be adopted by the other permanent members of the Security Council.89.	The role of the United Nations and of its specialized agencies is ever growing and unique. In order to be increasingly able to deal with the deep-rooted causes of international tension  the United Nations must enlarge its decision-making process by associating the emerging countries with it. At 'lie same time the United Nations must obtain the cooperation of the great democratic forces of the world. Democratic institutions in national societies remain alive and operate through the full support of their major political forces. Similarly the vitality and the efficiency of a world Organization depend  to a large extent  upon the adherence and contribution of the most influential nations.90.	Let me conclude by restating the sincere confidence of the Italian Government in the United Nations as well as in the purposes and principles of its Charter. I also wish to assure you once again that the Italian Government  interpreting the deep felt dedication to peace of its people  will continue to give its unrestricted cooperation to the United Nations."
"60",3508,"JAM",27,1972,"It is of special and symbolic significance to me that my first major statement outside of Jamaica since my election to office earlier this year should be made here  before this Assembly  in which so many of the hopes of mankind are invested  and I return thanks to God and to the people of Jamaica for making this possible.25.	Mr. President  may I extend to you  on behalf of the Government and the people of Jamaica  our congratulations on your election to the office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. As a distinguished son of Poland  you have been a steadfast contributor to the principles on which this Organization was founded. Your election  therefore  is a tribute not only to your great country and to you personally but also to the Eastern European group of nations  which you represent.26.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  who so ably guided our deliberations during the last session.27.	May I also take this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our satisfaction at the dynamism he has displayed since assuming the office of the Secretary-General.28.	It may surprise you  Mr. President  to learn that I hesitated long before deciding to come and make this statement myself. I hesitated because so many great voices have spoken with passion  eloquence and cogency about the world's problems that I realized that it would not lie within my powers to bring a new revelation to the continuing debate about the world and its crises. But in the end I decided to come because  with all its institutional limitations  this Organization  the United Nations  and this General Assembly still represent the highest aspirations of mankind and still offer the most efficient instrument that man has devised to translate these aspirations into reality for the benefit of all.29.	Therefore  may I speak to the Assembly  first  as the leader of a small and young nation and. second  in all humility for myself as a human being  and may I briefly redirect members' attention to the fundamental root and source of the continuing crises in human affairs which directly threatens the future of mankind and underlies so many current dislocations  tensions  upheavals and  indeed  violence around the globe.30.	As I said  my words cannot be new  because the world's problems do not arise from what men have said in this hall  but rather from the stubborn refusal of men to listen.31.	Simply put  this Assembly has become known as a place where torrents of words that burn with urgency and truth fall upon deaf ears-ears that are often closed by the narrowest considerations of national self-interest. The continuing inability of the United Nations to mediate situations of international crisis and reduce the inequalities between nations does not reflect any lack of desire or skill among the staff of this Organization or its various agencies. I suggest rather that the inadequacies of the United Nations precisely reflect the misplaced priorities of its Member nations and especially of the most powerful and wealthy ones among them.32.	I speak today for a new administration in Jamaica which has a clear and simple philosophy about human affairs. We believe that the idea of equality is the only enduring principle by which mankind may be guided in the conduct of national and international affairs. We believe  further  that the survival of mankind itself depends upon the speed with which man comes to learn that there must be a universal moral foundation for the conduct of affairs and that in the absence of a universal morality to determine relations within societies and as between nations modern technology will eventually destroy us.33.	Therefore  we begin with the thesis that unemployment and poverty  malnutrition  inadequate housing existing side by side with conspicuous affluence represent an intolerable invasion of the principle of equality and represent a challenge to the will of our nation which must be faced and overcome.34.	And  equally  we believe that the international juxtaposition of wealthy nations and poor nations is an affront to both the conscience and the common sense of mankind.35.	If we fail within Jamaica to build a society of equality and to achieve an equitable distribution of wealth among all our people  we will have failed our generation and history will exact its price.36.	But equally  if the international community fails to build an order that is founded upon the equitable distribution of the world's wealth  generations will arise that will sweep us away.37.	May I remind this Assembly of the two critical elements in our present dilemma. On the one hand  colonialism and technology have combined to create an intolerable and self-perpetuating disproportion between the wealth of nations. On the other hand  one of the most dangerous of man's gifts is his ability to mask the raw pursuit of self-interest behind the rhetoric of good intentions but technology has spread the rhetoric to the four corners of the globe and created a world that is no longer merely content to hope for social justice  but has come to demand it as a matter of right.38.	I believe that the United Nations at this moment is in danger of losing its collective will to pursue right. I believe that the wars which have raged unchecked  the pursuit of national self-interest by the great Powers and indeed by some of the small Powers too  the manipulation of focal points of tension by the great Powers to their own ends and purposes  and the continuing paralysis of the United Nations in the face of this sordid spectacle  are creating the danger that we may forfeit our collective will and see our resolve sink finally into the quicksands of cynicism. My plea  therefore  is the same to you as it is to my own people.39.	At home  we have launched a massive literacy campaign because a just society cannot function unless the doors of knowledge through reading are open to all the people. We are mobilizing our resources behind the elementary requirements of jobs  food and shelter for the people. We are seeking to mobilize these resources in the name of equality and through the method of self-reliance.40.	And here today  my plea to the world is for a re-commitment to international morality for its own sake and as the condition of survival.41.	Let me begin with the simplest possible illustration of what I mean by ""international morality"". The Government of Jamaica is proud of the fact that its initiative in relation to Southern Rhodesian participation in the Olympic Games led to an international process that ended with the repudiation of a formula for Southern Rhodesia's participation because that formula was totally inconsistent with any moral principle properly understood. We thank our African colleagues for their support  but we note the whole sequence of events with a residual concern.42.	Because of our adherence to the principle of international morality  I declare that the new Government of Jamaica is totally and bitterly opposed to the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia and to the continuing Portuguese tyranny in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). I also note with concern recent developments in Uganda.43.	Now that the overwhelming majority of the people of Southern Rhodesia have answered the inquiries of the Pearce Commission  we call upon the United Kingdom  once again  to bring that illegal  racist regime to an end.44.	I am proud to declare our unswerving support for the freedom fighters of Africa in their struggle for independence. I am equally proud that it was Jamaica  under the leadership of my late father  that was the first country in the world to forbid trade with South Africa and I believe that  small as we are  we pointed a moral direction for mankind to follow. Today  I reconfirm Jamaica's support of the various resolutions that call for economic sanctions against Portugal. However  I am concerned to note that once again there is evidence of international double-talk in respect of trade with Portugal. Among other things  I discovered that  in spite of Jamaica's support of Assembly resolutions calling for sanctions  we are actually conducting trade with that country. And I am announcing here and now that the Government of Jamaica will be taking steps to bring all trade with Portugal to a halt until its African colonies have won their freedom.45.	I turn now to the question of international terrorism and note with pleasure that the item  as amended by Jamaica  is to be debated [item 92]. Let me state Jamaica's position flatly.46.	Whenever the means of peaceful political action to correct oppression are effectively denied a people  we accept and support absolutely the right of the oppressed to fight for freedom and justice against the apparatus of authority that oppresses them. On the other hand  we totally and irrevocably repudiate all acts of violence which are directed against innocent third parties who have nothing to do with the- dispute.47.	I turn now from the question of international morality in the political arena to the problem of the world  its wealth and the developing nations.48.	The question of how the terrible inequalities of wealth between nations arose in the course of history has been thoroughly analyzed  massively documented and is completely understood. But two questions arise now. Should the present position be allowed to continue; and  if the answer is ""no""  have we the will to correct it? For let me be clear  I stress the word ""will"" because the question of technique does not arise.49.	Everybody knows perfectly' well what needs to be done to reverse the process by which rich nations get richer while poor nations get relatively poorer. The world's crisis arises because the major economic Powers are slow to accept the fact that our view of international economic relationships must undergo a transformation as total as that which brought political colonialism more or less to an end. I suggest that  to survive  the world must make the sort of commitment in the economic field that it is learning to make politically and racially; and it must do so  I repeat  as the condition of survival.50.	We know that at the heart of our economic problem are to be found three questions: the terms of trade  the price of money and the basis on which the proceeds that arise from the exploitation of natural resources are shared between the countries that have the resources and those that provide the capital and the know-how necessary for their exploitation. However  while we talk about these problems and indulge yesterday's fantasies about the exclusive and prescriptive rights of capital  the world sinks into an ever-widening abyss of inequality. Massive unemployment coexists with spectacular monuments to capital- intensive technology; the endless rows of shanty-town shacks are mocked by the high-rise condominiums of the affluent; levels of unemployment exist around the developing world which would tear apart the very fabric of metropolitian society; and everywhere there is the silent reproach to man's conscience of the young children trying to find a way to grow without the food  the shelter or the settled family patterns that they need.51.	What  then  can we do? To start with  we must summon our collective will and find the key to the international conscience  because without that the doors will not open. More specifically  reminding you that we are in the Second Development Decade  I wish to make a series of specific recommendations for the consideration of this great body and the many specialized agencies that it directs.52.	In the first place  I think that we must apply our minds to the role. ? ;ope and powers of the Economic and Social Council. This is the body that we have charged with the tremendous task of overseeing the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. However  it is impossible to implement a strategy if all the tactical elements are not working in harmony.53.	Noting with pleasure that the Economic and Social Council has recently been expanded  I now call upon the Assembly to take whatever steps are needed to ensure that the full power and authority to co-ordinate a coherent  integrated global development strategy rest clearly with the Economic and Social Council. It is entirely self-defeating for the Council to devise a strategy of development that is aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor countries and at assaulting world-wide problems of poverty and unemployment  only to find that the specialized agencies through which the Council must function are devoted to policies that are often in conflict with every thrust of central development planning. With respect  I suggest that this is a situation that is as illogical as it is unacceptable54.	Equally  in dealing with a development strategy  it is vital that the people who must plan should be kept free of the distraction of other problems  however important. I would suggest  then  that the direction of the Commission on Human Rights be removed from the immediate concern of the Economic and Social Council and that a human rights council be created which might well be merged with the Trusteeship Council. One is pleased to find that this latter is rapidly becoming self-liquidating as it approaches the completion of the tasks which were entrusted to it.55.	Before I turn to more specifics in the area of world economics  I should like to press upon your attention a central concern of mine. It is increasingly understood that it is impossible to separate the economic from the social aspects of development; and I will not bore you with a recitation of the interrelationships that are involved. However  I come increasingly to the conclusion that the world which came to understand that there is a close relationship between health and economic development  and later between education and economic development  must now need to understand that there is an even closer relationship between housing and economic development.56.	I am convinced that housing is going to have to become the great new area of world concern and effort. It seems to me that  in the absence of a home  much else that we seek to plan and to achieve is frustrated and overwhelmed by the sheer  brutal reality of shanty-town life. I believe that much of education is lost upon a child who returns from school to share one room with his brothers  sisters and parents. I believe that many of the hostilities and tensions which frustrate the economic process can be traced  at least in part  to this problem. Therefore I wish to suggest that the international community should address its mind to the development of a world-wide plan for housing. I was pleased to see that the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has taken note of this problem and called for support for the housing fund that was proposed at that Conference. I suggest that formulas be explored for ensuring that funds for housing become a planned and standard addition wherever investment capital moves.57.	In the more obviously economic area  we will propose that the entire basis on which special drawing rights are handled should be revised. Special drawing rights should be a key element in the whole process by which capital for development purposes is transferred from the metropolitan to the developing countries.58.	Equally  I wish to draw attention to the rules that govern the availability of soft loans  through the international monetary agencies  to the developing world. The present criterion for eligibility for soft loans that distinguishes nations on the basis of per capita income is clearly inadequate. Obviously  per capita income is no measure of the ability of an economy to provide a life for all its people and shows only that there is some wealth for some people. I propose  then  that we work out additional criteria under which developing countries may qualify for low-interest loans  and I make two specific proposals to that end: firstly  that high rates of unemployment in a country should be accepted as a measure for eligibility wherever that exceeds some predetermined level and  secondly  that certain social priorities should be isolated for soft loan purposes  regardless of other circumstances. The most important of these should be housing.59.	I should now like to turn to an even more fundamental consideration of world economics. It has always been assumed that the continuing imbalance between the living standards of the nations must be adjusted by transfers of aid and technical know-how from developed to developing States. However  the international community counts as aid certain kinds of capital movement whose net effect can only be to increase the long-term drain on the resources of the poorer States. At the same time  the United Nations sets targets for the amount of total aid which should be given. To begin with  there is doubt whether those targets are adequate  but not even those targets are ever met. Yet no sense of urgency infuses our discussion of this problem.60.	Are we prepared to face the facts? This widening gap will never be closed by economic aid alone  for the simple reason that the established system of economic relations between developed and developing nations works in the opposite direction. Under the established system  which has thus far been singularly resistant to change  the lion's share of the gains from international trade and investment from the extraction  conversion and sale of the world's raw materials accrues to those who command supplies of capital and know-how  and these are inevitably the developed nations.61.	Nothing less  then  than a reorganization of the system  of the basic economic relations between the two groups  gives any real hope of ever narrowing that gap. I think that the leaders of the developed nations have a moral obligation to address their minds  with us  to this reorganization  an obligation based sometimes on historical facts concerning the original sources of their present wealth  but also based on simple common sense about the future condition of mankind. Some other basis must be found  and soon  for the international distribution of the gains from international economic activity. I think that these leaders have a duty to make clear to their own citizens that  unless they are to continue as islands of affluence and luxury surrounded by seas of poverty and misery  we just cannot all go on having business as usual  profits as usual  national growth rates as usual. Some sacrifice on their own part must also be involved. I say  let the process of adjustment in these gains between developed and developing States begin with what we  the developing countries  own: our mineral resources.62.	The time has come to reconstruct the basis on which the gains arising from the exploitation of these resources are shared between those  on the one hand  who provide the capital and know-how  and those  on the other  who own the resources and provide the essential infrastructure and the labor force. Let the resources continue in our ownership from the point of extraction to the final sale of the processed product. Let the agreements of the future cover  not the sale of our resources to developed countries  but the reasonable payments which shall be made to those who supply capital and know-how for their services in the process of conversion.63.	It will be recalled that I spoke earlier  in relation to my own country  of the method of self-reliance. I believe that this has relevance and application in the international field in so far as the developing countries are concerned. We have a responsibility to ourselves to explore every avenue through which we can promote our own development. This is going to require the planned exploration of trading opportunities within the developing world; it is also going to demand the creation of institutions through which we can mobilize our own savings and apply them to our own concept of priorities. In response to similar needs and common pressure  the developing world is evolving its own know-how and ought now to establish the closest communication in the area of indigenous technology and organization.64.	It is my firm belief that  along with the increasing exploration of trading opportunities  the Member States of the developing world should plan to set aside an agreed share of national income for joint development purposes and to create appropriate institutions through which this capital may be invested.65.	It is my belief that a fund generated in this way could make a major contribution to international progress and be a sign to the world of the capacity of developing nations to promote the conditions of their own development through international co-operation in their own ranks.66.	To this end  and if the idea finds favor  my Government proposes to invite other developing nations to attend a conference in Jamaica in 1973 to discuss the ways and means of implementing this proposal.67.	And so  I end as I began  humble in the face of the awesome responsibility that faces all those who aspire to leadership and conscious of the great voices which have bespoken the cause of peace and justice from this rostrum.68.	May I urge the members of this Assembly to remember that throughout history there have always been those who have called for the creation of a moral frame within which men and nations may deal with one another. More than ever it is those voices that we must heed. The requirements of survival and justice demand that we listen and act  and now."
"61",3554,"JOR",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is my privilege to join all my colleagues in extending heartiest congratulations to you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current  twenty-seventh session. Your high qualities of statesmanship will be of great value as you steer the work of this session to the successful conclusion to which all Member States aspire.2.	I should like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who  since his assumption of this key position  has worked tirelessly  with selfless dedication  towards fulfilling the resolutions and recommendations of this august body.3.	There are many people who believe that the United Nations is ineffectual in matters pertaining to the ultimate issues of human welfare. For this reason proposals are being made for amending the Charter. But it is often overlooked that it is the Member States that lay down and implement policies  and not an abstract body called the United Nations. This must be stated clearly and forcefully if the United Nations is to live up to the challenge which animated its founders more than a quarter of a century ago. They intended to ensure a supranational structure dedicated to peace with justice and to the unity of mankind.4.	There must be something wrong somewhere when the overwhelming will of this all-embracing body is flouted with impunity  as is the case in the Middle East.Peace and justice are indivisible  and the rule of law  whether in national or in international affairs  is likewise indivisible. This is the essence of collective responsibility  as well as the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.5.	If my words reflect misgivings  it is not my intention to sound a counsel of despair. Both under the United Nations and independently of it  there is emerging in the world community a spirit of detente  which my delegation wholeheartedly applauds. Many areas which  over the past quarter-century  have been hotbeds of potential confrontation nave been turned into areas of accommodation  or at least of peaceful coexistence. My delegation expresses the hope that all States and all nations will join the trend towards abandonment of war as an instrument of policy.6.	One of the issues raised during the current session of the General Assembly is the item on international terrorism [item 92]. Jordan is opposed to violence  whatever its source or methods. Jordan is ready to participate effectively in any international measures to protect innocent civilians against violence. At the same time Jordan and  I am sure  all peoples of the world support the right of an occupied people-every occupied people effectively to resist occupation and colonialism.7.	As I speak on behalf of Jordan and against a back-ground of the problems which my country has been compelled to endure in consequence of the 1967 war  my remarks on the role of the United Nations in resolving conflicts assume a stark and deadly reality. And let me declare in the strongest terms that  with only the tragic exception of Indochina  the Middle East remains the only area outside the pale of justice  peace and security. In Jordan human beings like you  gentlemen  are daily faced with tribulations violating every principle  concept or ideal to which the United Nations addresses itself. My address  therefore  to this distinguished gathering is far from being an academic exercise and  still less  a sermon on the virtues of virtuous behavior.8.	What are the basic ingredients in the situation which is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis? I fully realize that the case has been stated and restated very often  year in and year out; and yet it must be restated  if only because no progress whatsoever has been achieved towards its just and peaceful solution. On the contrary  the passage of years is compounding an already desperate situation and making it intolerable. The basic facts of the case  as of today  are as follows.9.	First  as a result of the 1967 war in the Middle East  nearly half of the citizens of Jordan have been  for more than five years  suffering the bondage and enslavement of Israeli occupation. A similar fate has befallen substantial parts of the territories of Egypt and Syria. Occupation  like slavery  is a curse  regardless of its nature or duration; it is doubly so when the victims are a whole population and when deliverance seems to be receding into an unknown abyss.10.	To us the issues at stake are fundamental: they are nothing less than a mortal threat to the very survival of Jordan as a State and as a people. Israel makes no pretense about its determination to swallow up at least those substantial parts of Jordan which it already occupies. Peace  to the Israelis  seems no longer anything but an empty expression which is conveniently used in forums such as the United Nations a use of language to conceal the aim.11.	Experience tells us that the people under Israeli occupation are not looked upon as a community of human beings with a birthright expectation of continuity in their homeland; rather  they are looked upon as things or obstacles  to be removed at the appropriate moment of Israel's choosing; hence the urgency of collective world action to bring about the speediest termination of occupation and the salvation of the multitudes in Israel's bondage.12.	Second  the traumatic consequences of the events of 1948  which resulted in the physical dispersal of well over 1 million Palestinian refugees  have been increased by the events of 1967 a repeat of those of 1948. An additional half a million victims were added to the ranks of the uprooted. They are referred to as ""displaced persons"" to differentiate them from their own compatriots  the 1948 refugees. But even this differentiation is becoming blurred as occupation continues unchecked. The United Nations resolutions pertaining to the immediate repatriation of the displaced population are being added to the stockpile of United Nations resolutions which Israel consistently ignores.13.	Third  the United Nations and its Member States have  since 1967  made every effort to bring about a peaceful and just solution to the conflict. On 22 November 1967  the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967); its points were clear  its intent specific. It reaffirmed the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories. It provided guarantees for a just and lasting peace. Both Jordan and Egypt accepted that resolution and all the obligations devolving upon them under its terms. Not only did they express their acceptance by every possible means and on every conceivable occasion but they also registered their unqualified acceptance in writing. That was done in the course of replying to specific questions put by the most able and dedicated Ambassador Jarring in the spring of 1969.14.	The Israeli response to Mr. Jarring's earnest mission was not only negative but also misleading and hostile. Israel continues to give such a response to this very day. The Israelis  in effect  have opted for territorial expansion in preference to the long-cherished goal of a just and lasting peace.15.	The United Nations and the world at large are fully justified in asking  why is it that peace seems so remote and elusive in the Middle East? What stands in the way of a solution of the problem which has kept the world on edge for almost 25 years?16.	We are convinced that there will be no solution to the Palestine problem until the problem of Israel is solved. What is the Israeli problem? Simply stated  here is a country created by this very body  the United Nations  when its membership still consisted of only a minority of mankind. From the date of its birth in the heart of Palestine  over the protest of the Palestinian people themselves and their Arab neighbors and brethren  Israel has been the center of never-ending conflict. Although a creation of the United Nations  Israel's outspoken defiance of this body and of its resolutions has weakened the power of the United Nations to the point of impotency.17.	Veterans of debates in this Assembly recall only too well the hope for peace that followed the truce of 1948; they recall only too well the subsequent resolution that guaranteed to Palestinians who had been driven from their homes the right to return to them or to be compensated for their losses [resolution 194 (III)]. Never did this body feel surer of its wisdom or more confident of its power: within months peace would return to the Middle East.18.	But that was the day that the power of the United Nations was first challenged and began to crumble. That was the day that Israel first defied the United Nations. Israel refused to allow one uprooted Palestinian to return to his home and refused to pay one penny of his losses. And for 25 years hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have lived in exile.19.	Today  of course-except when the budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is passed-we have forgotten all about these refugees. Today our concern is with Israel's defiance of another resolution  the Security Council resolution of November 1967. Called on to withdraw from the Arab territories seized during the June war in return for a lasting peace  Israel has simply refused. Confident that its defiance will meet with no more than mild rebukes  it continues to occupy Arab land  and challenges the United Nations and the Arabs to do anything about it. So I submit that we must bring the Israel question before the General Assembly.20.	What is to become of Israel? Is it to go on from conquest to conquest  fulfilling at last the Zionist dream of a land extending from the Nile to the Euphrates? Despite Israel's past successes  this hardly seems a realizable goal while all the world is watching. Yet in the mind of many a Zionist zealot this is the only way to in-gather the 12 million Jews from all over the world. Or will Israel content itself with holding on firmly to the Arab lands it already has: Sinai; the west bank of the Jordan  including Jerusalem; and the Syrian Golan heights? Five years have passed since those lands were occupied  and nothing on the horizon indicates Israel's intention to do anything else but to continue to occupy them.21.	Obviously  either the expansion or continuation of Israel's present course will lead to perpetual conflict. The former  I imagine  would bring others into the conflict. The latter and this is much more likely to happen would be the war into which both sides seem regrettably to be drafting. If such a war were fought  it would be to the end. It would lead to the devastation of the whole area.22.	For the moment Israel has rejected the right choice: the one offered in the 1967 resolution. It may well be that it will continue to reject it  year after year  as the years pass. The mentality of Israel's present leadership should change to one less conditioned by fixed dogma and prejudice  one which will agree with the rest of the world that in the 1967 resolution lies the one best hope for a political settlement. It came as no surprise at all that the Israeli Foreign Minister  in his misleading speech before the Assembly at its 2045th meeting  chose to ignore the resolution altogether in a calculated affront to those who adopted it.23.	There are innumerable issues which can be intelligently explained only within the context of Israeli ideology and practices. First  there are the undisguised declarations of intent permanently to annex occupied territories of three Member States under the flimsy pretext of security. Does security  in the dwarfed spaces of the modern age  depend on a hilltop here or a little town there? Then  there are the attacks against the adjacent Arab countries  resulting in considerable loss of life and property  mainly amongst innocent civilians. We might add the negative attitude of Israel towards each and every attempt to resolve the conflict in accordance with the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 and the scores of other related resolutions. Then there are the flagrant violations of the Geneva Conventions governing the"" rights of civilian inhabitants under occupation; the wanton destruction of villages and towns; and  last but not least  the dispersal of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from the territories which fell victim to occupation.24.	No discussion of the crisis in the Middle East would be meaningful without emphasis in the strongest terms on the fate and future of Jerusalem  a city hallowed by hundreds of millions of believers-Moslems  Christians and Jews-all over the world. The Israeli claims to an exclusive hold on that great historic city and the systematic efforts since the occupation to transform its unique identity are not only a violation of its sanctity  but also a deep wound inflicted upon the conscience of humanity.25.	It was in recognition of this fact that both the General Assembly and the Security Council adopted specific resolutions for the preservation of Jerusalem. These were in addition to the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967  which provided for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories  including the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem.26.	The Israelis describe their annexation as unification  ignoring the fact that there can be no unification in bondage  where one community tramples upon the soul  the human dignity  the land and the accumulated culture of other communities.27.	As we declare that we hold on to our rights in Jerusalem  let me emphasize in the name of Jordan and of all peoples of goodwill that believe in the unique sanctity of Jerusalem  that it will always remain the key to a just and lasting solution in the Middle East.28.	One of the most crucial developments that stemmed from the June war of 1967 has been an awareness throughout the world of the magnitude of the injustice that has befallen the people of Palestine. The people of Jordan and Palestine are one and the same. The people on both banks of the Jordan have shared a common national life over the past quarter-century. The aspirations of the Palestinian people to restore their national identity  which was brutally shattered in 1948  has inspired Jordan to seek ways and means of promoting the constructive expression of a Palestinian identity without destroying the basic unity that binds the east and west banks together. It is sometimes overlooked that almost every family on the west bank of the Jordan has sons  daughters  mothers and in-laws on the east bank  and vice versa.29.	The Israeli occupation of the west bank has resulted in one of the most massive and shattering cases of family separation that history has ever known. The temporary visits to the next-of-kin on the occupied west bank  to which the Israeli Foreign Minister gave a distorted meaning  merely serve to highlight the magnitude of this human tragedy.30.	Inspired by the imperative need to preserve the basic unity of our country without forfeiting the regional identities of the two components of the Kingdom  Jordan has put forward a plan for the creation of a federal State the United Arab Kingdom.31.	The United Arab Kingdom would comprise two autonomous regions: the Jordanian and the Palestinian. The Palestinian region within the federation would be open as a homeland to every Palestinian wherever he might be. He would then be a citizen as of right and not on sufferance. It is an effort towards the gathering in of the Palestinian people after their inhuman Diaspora. It would be open to unity with any Palestinian territory so choosing. Its capital would naturally be Arab Jerusalem.32.	The plan would not only ensure the gathering of the Palestinians into a territory which is theirs but would also maintain the essential link of that Palestinian identity with the rest of the Arab world  of which the Palestinians are an integral part  through its association with the eastern part of the Kingdom.33.	I should like to stress that the plan would become feasible and capable of implementation only after the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab lands. What stands in its way? It is the problem of Israel.34.	Israel has more than once achieved its military objectives in its conflicts with the Arabs  but not once has it succeeded in achieving the fruits of its successes  or peace. All wars and struggles  no matter how intense or brutal  end in peace. The war which Zionism has waged and continues to wage against the Arab nation is an exception. The reason is what I have called the Israeli problem.35.	Let Israel free itself of the militaristic obsession. Let it free itself of Zionist euphoria and genuinely reach for peace.36.	Already there are internal rumblings that will grow louder in the coming years if only given a proper and just chance. Among those rumblings are: the present openly expressed realization among Israelis that an injustice has been done to Palestinians; strikes and demonstrations against racial discrimination; the steady increase in the emigration of skilled western Israelis back to western countries; the restlessness caused by the second-class status of eastern-born Jews as compared with European-born Israelis; the growing fear that with no new crisis Western dollars will no longer flow in such a steady stream.37.	These and other signs of inner discontent are troubling the Israeli leadership. But they are giving encouragement to the rest of the world or at least to part of it that a new world can emerge in the Middle East.38.	In the struggle to reach such a new world in the Middle East Jordan intends to play no small or insignificant role. It has set its course for a vigorous march to a happy and prosperous future. With wise and courageous leadership  the good will of its people and the support of its friends everywhere  Jordan intends to contribute its share to the future of this world."
"62",3601,"JPN",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Japanese delegation  I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your assumption of the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that your outstanding knowledge and vision and rich experience in the United Nations will lead this session of the General Assembly to a fruitful conclusion.2.	At the same time  I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Adam Malik  the former President of the General Assembly. It still remains fresh in our memory that the success of the exceedingly eventful twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly was to a great extent attributable to his outstanding leadership.3.	I wish also to take this opportunity to express my deep respect to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  four esteemed Secretary- General. Although he assumed this high post not too long ago  he is traveling and sparing no efforts to ensure world peace and to consolidate the basis of the United Nations. I hope that the Secretary-General will continue his endeavors through his dynamic activities for the strengthening of world peace and the further enhancement of the prestige of the United Nations.4.	As various countries have become more closely and extensively interrelated in the political  economic  social  cultural and other fields  international relations have become more diverse and complex. The world of today is characterized  first  by the trend towards the relaxation of international tensions and  second  by progress in international co-operation . in many different fields. This is a tendency welcome to the United Nations  which aims at the maintenance of international peace and security as well as the strengthening of international co-operation.5.	On the other hand  conflicts over many fundamental questions have not yet been completely resolved in various parts of the world  and some questions have come to assume even greater complexity.6.	In this world of today  I believe that the role to be played by the United Nations has become increasingly diversified and has acquired added importance. At the same time  I wish to emphasize the ever greater need for the United Nations to deal with the many questions before it  analyzing carefully the nature of each case on the basis of a sufficient understanding of realities. In the present international situation it is not a constructive position either to overestimate the United Nations by expecting too much of it or  conversely  to underestimate it by expecting too little of it. It is my firm conviction that today  of all times  the United Nations is expected to make its steadfast endeavors in a realistic manner  so that its prestige may be enhanced.7.	With that realistic manner in mind  I wish to stress certain aspects of the role of the United Nations against the background of the present international situation and to try  at the same time  to view in perspective what the future United Nations should be.8.	The main trend of international relations for these past several years has been characterized by the transition from an age of chronic tensions created by the intense confrontation between the Eastern and the Western blocs to an age of relaxation of tensions against the background of the so-called multi-polarization of power. The talks which took place in the first half of this year between the United States and China and between the United States and the Soviet Union were events which have further accelerated such tendencies. In Europe  agreement on the Berlin question was reached among the States concerned  and the relaxation of tension in Europe is progressing steadily.9.	Concurrently  in the various regions of Asia there is a gradually growing common awareness that peace and stability in the area should be ensured by means of mutual understanding and co-operation among the nations.10.	The Government of Japan believes that the current visit of Prime Minister Tanaka to China and the summit talks between the leaders of the two countries will contribute to the relaxation of tension in Asia and ultimately to the promotion of world peace  if a foundation is firmly laid thereby for establishing neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries.A/PV.204211.	Yesterday from this rostrum the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Mr. Gromyko  referred to the forthcoming negotiations for a peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union [2040th meeting  para. 55]. The Government of Japan is convinced that the conclusion of a peace treaty to solve the unsettled issues between the two countries would greatly contribute not only to the furthering of neighborly and friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union but also to the promotion of peace and stability in Asia and indeed in the whole world. Japan's desire for the success of these talks is  to say the least  not less than anybody else's.12.	In the Korean peninsula  the way has been paved for a direct dialog  and the spontaneous efforts for the settlement of questions between South Korea and North Korea have begun to take concrete shape  as is evidenced in the Red Cross talks between the South and the North  as well as in the joint Communique of the Governments of North and South Korea of 4 July \ 912[Al8727  annex I]. These trends are of course most welcome to the United Nations  which has always taken an active interest in the peaceful unification of Korea. It is essential that the United Nations should continue to keep a sympathetic eye on such dialogs between South and North Korea so that they may bear tangible fruits as soon as possible.13.	Furthermore  among the Asian States there have been noteworthy trends towards regional co-operation among the neighboring nations and the settlement of questions of common concern  as illustrated by the recent moves of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. To our gratification  the Simla Agreement has been reached on 3 July 1972 between India and Pakistan  and efforts of reconciliation are under way among the States concerned. I hope that the day will soon come when Bangladesh will be admitted to the United Nations.14.	It goes without saying that the tendency towards the relaxation of tension observed in various parts of the world is to be welcomed by the United Nations as the Organization responsible for the maintenance of international peace. The development of spontaneous endeavors in Asia is a particularly welcome move in the light of the spirit of the United Nations Charter  which attaches importance to the maintenance and strengthening of peace through regional co-operation. I am convinced that the United Nations should continue to view with appreciation these spontaneous endeavors among the States concerned and demonstrate its readiness to extend assistance  whenever necessary  in order to make such endeavors more fruitful.15.	In contrast with these favorable developments  unfortunate circumstances remain in various parts of the world where disputes or situations persist but where there is no forum for direct talks between the parties concerned or where no direct contact has yet led to any constructive achievements. In the IndoChinese peninsula  armed conflicts still continue  and it seems that the prospect for peace is still uncertain. Japan welcomes the resumption of the Paris peace talks and sincerely hopes that real peace will be brought about in this area as soon as possible through negotiations between the parties concerned.16.	With reference to the Middle East  there has been an incessant eruption of violence and reprisal  as all of us have observed in the recent series of tragic events. Japan took an active part from the outset in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and has ever since been exerting its maximum efforts  within and .outside the Security Council  so that the States concerned may as promptly as possible establish a lasting peace through a spirit of self-restraint and accommodation. We ardently hope that the United Nations will continue to tackle this question in a most positive manner.17.	Furthermore  another task not spectacular but extremely meaningful- that the United Nations can undertake is to create the basic conditions that would be conducive to the establishment of peace in the area. In this respect  I evaluate highly the activities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [UNR WA]  which is dealing with relief aid for the nearly 1.5 million Palestinian Arab refugees. Japan is determined to continue to contribute positively to ensuring peace in the area by strengthening and expanding further the scale of its co-operation with the relief work of UNRWA.18.	The continuation of the policy of racial discrimination and illegal minority rule in southern Africa constitutes a source of incessant tension in that region. My country has a full understanding of the sincere endeavors which African States have been making towards the goal of achieving self-determination and the elimination of racial discrimination and believes that the United Nations should further intensify its constructive efforts towards the earliest possible solution of these problems by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of its Charter. Particularly under the present circumstances  in which direct talks between the parties concerned have become virtually impossible  it is my firm belief that the United Nations should be utilized in a more positive and constructive manner as a forum for consultations in which the parties concerned participate. The settlement of the questions related to southern Africa  naturally requires a patient and practical approach. In this sense  it is highly commendable that the Secretary-General has been conducting dialogs with all the parties concerned  including the Government of the Republic of South Africa  and has achieved some encouraging progress in respect of the question of Namibia  regarding which an impasse has persisted for so many years.19.	I have touched upon several points concerning what role the United Nations can play in solving major problems facing the world today. In the light of the trends towards detente apparent in today's world  I would point out that it is of vital importance for the United Nations to support  encourage and render positive assistance to further such trends in a timely and flexible manner  instead of remaining an indifferent bystander. It is an undeniable fact that a number of problems in which the peace and security of the world were involved were placed under the close observation and scrutiny of the entire international community through the public debates of the United Nations  and catastrophe was thereby avoided. It is also true that the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  carried out in the troubled areas of the world  have checked the escalation of armed conflicts and prevented their recurrence  and such action deserves high regard as a steady contribution towards securing peace in a quiet but constructive manner. These facts  more than anything else  clearly indicate that the role the United Nations has been playing for the maintenance of peace has been by no means insignificant. I wish to point out that it is important for the United Nations to continue and intensify such quiet but constructive activities in the future.20.	Similarly  I believe that the United Nations should play an analogous role in dealing with the question of international terrorism and matters related thereto. We are firmly opposed to any act of violence  whatever its reason may be  and we sincerely hope that the United Nations and other appropriate forums will take effective measures to put an end to these regrettable acts.21.	On the other hand  the role the United Nations is expected in play in the world today should not be confined to such a passive one as the prevention of the outbreak and spread of conflicts. In the past few years my country has repeatedly stressed in this Assembly hall the importance of the struggle for peace. What has been stressed by our delegation is indeed the attitude of positively winning peace; in other words  we believe that it is important for the United Nations to step up its endeavors to remove in advance the source of troubles which might cause the outbreak of conflicts  rather than limiting itself to playing the role of what may be called a fire brigade by seeking to suppress a conflict that has already erupted and prevent its expansion.22.	What  then  can be done by the United Nations in such a positive pursuit of peace? In this respect  I wish to take up  first  the efforts for disarmament; second  the efforts for international economic and social development; and third  the efforts towards the strengthening of the United Nations itself in the organizational and financial fields  the basis which makes the first two efforts possible. It is on these three points that I intend to devote the rest of my statement in order to elaborate the position of my country.23.	The most serious problem which our world is facing today is that of the control and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons  which have sufficient destructive power to annihilate human beings. In this respect  it is most gratifying that efforts by nuclear-weapon States towards nuclear disarmament have at last shown a first sign of fruition. The two and a half years of negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union culminated in Moscow on 26 May 1972 in the concrete achievement of the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. This tangible fruit of the efforts of these two nuclear Powers towards disarmament deserves our high regard.24.	However  to our regret  it is also the fact that a heated nuclear-armaments race is still continuing among the nuclear-weapon States. Particularly  it is most deplorable that such States  ignoring the strong objections of world public opinion  should be continuing and intensifying their nuclear tests. Although  as is well known  the question of banning nuclear-weapon tests had been the greatest issue in the post-war disarmament negotiations  no tangible result has been achieved in respect of a ban on the underground testing of nuclear weapons since 1963  when the so-called partial nuclear test-ban treaty  came into being to prohibit nuclear weapon tests in environments other than under-ground. Moreover  two nuclear-weapon States continue to refuse to become parties to this treaty  and have still been carrying out nuclear tests in the atmosphere despite protests registered by other countries apprehending the destruction of the human environment.25.	I wish to express my ardent hope that the current session of the General Assembly will bend all its efforts to the early realization of a ban on nuclear tests by the nuclear-weapon States and to the prompt realization of concrete disarmament measures  particularly measures for nuclear disarmament  with the participation of all nuclear- weapon States in the disarmament negotiations.26.	The mutual interrelationships of States and peoples as they are developing and intensifying across national boundaries in such diverse spheres as economy  science and technology  social affairs  culture  and so forth  may be regarded as the basic feature of today's world. With all this diversification  it is inevitable that the world of today calls for greater solidarity on the part of the international community.27.	The United Nations is not an international organization which merely deals with political questions. This is the place where we debate and take action on all aspects of international life. As international relations are intensified and diversified  the importance of the role of the United Nations as a comprehensive international Organization aiming at the strengthening of the solidarity of the international community has greatly increased.28.	In particular  the United Nations has promptly applied itself to the task of wrestling with problems which are on the front line of today's world  such as the question of economic and social development  which is commonly known as ""the north and south problem""; questions relating to the development and use of outer space and the sea-bed  which may be called ""man's last frontiers""; the improvement and redevelopment of the human environment  and so forth. These efforts merit a high tribute  inasmuch as they open unlimited possibilities for the future of the United Nations.29.	It is from this viewpoint that I would like to take note of the significance of the two international conferences held in the first half of this year. One is the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTADJ  held last April and May in Santiago  the aim of which was the further promotion of the economic welfare of mankind; the other is the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held last June at Stockholm with a view to conserving the natural environment  which is indispensable to the existence of mankind. Nothing has so symbolically demonstrated the necessity for the unity and solidarity of mankind living on this one earth as these two international conferences held 10 000 miles apart in Santiago in the southern hemisphere  and in Stockholm in the northern hemisphere. These two conferences were clear evidence that the United Nations  embodying the aspirations of mankind  can play a most useful role in the emerging fields of the economic and social development of the world.30.	The sources of tension in the present world are often found in the existence of hunger and poverty. For many years  the United Nations has been endeavoring to resolve the problems of the economic gap between the developing and the developed countries  and the goals and objectives of its efforts are clearly stated in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].31.	In their efforts towards economic independence  the developing countries have faced a number of difficulties  and this has tended to give rise to the confrontation between the south and the north. In order to overcome such difficulties  it is indispensable that a close co-ordination should be maintained between the efforts of the developing countries and the assistance extended by the developed countries. In other words  this is a problem which should be approached in the context of the common responsibility of the international community and should be solved through mutual understanding between the developed and the developing countries and by the accumulation of agreements based on such understanding.32.	Motivated by such considerations  my country  in co-operation with other participants  spared no effort to bring about a meeting of minds between the developed and the developing countries at the third session of UNCTAD. As a result of such efforts  agreements were reached on many issues  agreements based on the mutual understanding of each other's positions. I am convinced that the adoption of resolutions embodying these agreements was a significant achievement of the Conference.33.	Naturally  the results of the Santiago conference should be appraised from a long-term point of view  inasmuch as the conference dealt with problems of historical significance. However  I should like to point out that one result of the Conference was of particular significance in giving orientation to the north-south question: that is  the recognition of the need for effective participation of the developing countries in the international monetary and trade systems. This basic concord was already implemented in part when the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related issues was established within the International Monetary Fund  and the multilateral trade negotiations beginning in 1973 are being prepared with the participation of developing countries.34.	Japan will implement the measures to which it pledged itself at the third session of UNCTAD  including such measures as the attainment of the target of bringing its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of its gross national product  the improvement of the terms and conditions of such assistance in particular by the promotion of untied assistance in general and the early and substantial improvement of the generalized scheme of preferences. My country is determined to co-operate positively in solving the many problems which the Santiago Conference left unsolved.35.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  aimed at the protection of what it called ""Only One Earth"" from the peril of destruction  was  in our view  one of the most successful and epoch-making conferences ever held by the United Nations. We attach particular importance to the dramatic achievement constituted by the success of the Conference in adopting its Declaration  in the deliberations on which the delegations of 113 countries took part  with all their different backgrounds of political  economic and social systems  traditions and value judgments.36.	Among the important principles contained in this Declaration we evaluate highly the very appropriate inclusion of principle 26  which states:""Man and his environment must be spared the effects ofnuclear weapons and all other means of mass destruction."" This principle was originally proposed and strongly pressed by the Japanese delegation.37.	With regard to the Environment Fund to be used for the implementation of a series of international action-plans for the preservation and improvement of the global human environment  it is the intention of my Government  as our representative stated at the Conference  to contribute up to 10 per cent of the target amount of the Fund. It is our hope that  through the appropriate operation of the Fund  all related activities of United Nations agencies and the efforts of every nation towards the protection and enhancement of the human environment will be effectively co-ordinated.38.	I wish to stress that it is the common goal of all peoples  whether developed or developing  to preserve a better environment for the present and future generations. In order to attain this purpose continuous and strenuous efforts over a long period of time are needed. In this context  we fully endorsed at the Stockholm Conference the recommendation for convening a second United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.  We think it desirable that the details relating to this second Conference  including its time and place  should be fully examined in such appropriate bodies as the governing council for environmental programs  expected to be established at this session of the General Assembly  taking into account further developments which may take place in the future.""9. I wish to refer now to another international conference to be organized by the United Nations that may equal in its significance the two United Nations conferences which I have just dwelt upon. It is the third conference on the law of the sea  scheduled to be held in 1973 with the objective of strengthening the international order with regard to the sea. Japan has consistently and positively participated in the deliberations of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction ever since it was established in 1967. The Japanese Government has particular concern and profound interest in the outcome of the conference on the law of the sea.40. My country sincerely hopes that that conference  after an elaborate and impartial study of all aspects of the peaceful uses of the ocean  will succeed in establishing a new global order which will benefit the whole community of nations and will harmonize in the fairest manner the interests of all the countries in the world. We shall make every effort to see that that hope is fully realized and shall maintain close contact with all the interested countries in the course of the preparations for the holding of the conference.41.	Twenty-seven years have elapsed since the United Nations was founded  aspiring to permanent peace and the welfare of mankind. During this period the United Nations has had remarkable achievements in various fields of its activities. But has the United Nations fully lived up to the expectations held for it at the time of its foundation? One must admit that in this respect the general assessment is not always favorable. This is especially the case with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  which is the primary objective of the United Nations.42.	As I stated in the earlier part of my remarks  the peace-keeping operations have certain weaknesses  owing to the lack of specific provisions in the Charter relating to them. I believe that the same can be said about the fact-finding functions of the United Nations.43.	Of course  no organization can properly function without the will of those who run it. It may be true that many of the criticisms now directed against our Organization have arisen  not exclusively from the organizational or constitutional defects of the United Nations  but  in many instances  from the absence of the will on the part of Member States to observe the United Nations Charter. It is obviously important  therefore  that the Member States should reaffirm their determination to observe faithfully the Charter of the United Nations and prove their determination by their deeds.44.	Nevertheless  there is no gainsaying the fact that  with the passage of 27 years since the foundation of our Organization  there have appeared many discrepancies between the organization and functioning of the United Nations as originally envisaged by the Charter and the way it actually functions today When we think that these 27 years have seen the most drastic changes in the history of international relations  the emergence of such discrepancies could well be regarded as inevitable. But I believe that it is not for us to leave these discrepancies as they are without probing into them  if we have hope and confidence in the future of our Organization and a desire to see it strengthened.45.	The United Nations  which is the sole parliamentary organ of international society  can function in a truly effective manner as the focal point of international peace and co-operation only if we recognize fully the changes which have occurred in international society in the past quarter of a century and adjust ourselves to them with appropriate flexibility.46.	I am convinced that it is high time for all Member States to put aside all past differences and to study with an open mind ways and means for strengthening the organization and functioning of the United Nations. I earnestly hope that constructive steps forward in this direction will be taken during the present session of the General Assembly.47.	It is of utmost importance that the United Nations should be provided with a sound and solid financial basis if it is to fulfill its expected role. I should like to invite attention to the deplorable situation in which the United Nations finds itself  prevented from performing its effective and efficient activities because of ever-accumulating deficits. For any organization  sound and rational financing is a prerequisite to its viability. And without such financing  no organization would be able to conduct a long-term and effective operation. I do believe that now is the time for Member States to join forces to solve the problem. Japan considers that those Member States which are directly connected to the cause of the present financial crisis of the United Nations should adopt constructive attitudes conducive to a solution of the problem. However  in view of the fact that this is an important question confronting all Member States  Japan wishes to render its co-operation from a practical standpoint.48.	Furthermore  as the United Nations expands its fields of activities every year  it has become all the more important to secure and use effectively the funds necessary for such activities. I believe it is imperative for the Member States to take a keener interest and give positive co-operation on this question of securing the funds for United Nations activities. Lately  Japan's financial contributions to the United Nations have been increasing at a very fast pace. This reflects the great expectations and ardent support of our people for the United Nations and its activities. It is the intention of my country to continue to increase its contribution in this field as far as its national capacity permits.49.	Twenty-seven years ago  mankind placed in this Organization boundless hope for the achievement of permanent peace and the promotion of the welfare of mankind.50.	Deeply conscious that there is no other international peace machinery to replace the United Nations  and recalling the spirit which inspired the United Nations at the time of its foundation  I believe we should make as large an effort as possible to foster and strengthen this Organization.51.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization for the year 1971-1972  the Secretary-General stated:""The Member States alone can develop the potential of the Organization by using it and obeying its rules  by holding to the long-term objectives of the Charter in spite of short-term disappointments and frustrations  and by accepting the imperfections and shortcomings of the United Nations not as a mark of failure  but as part of the inevitable process of growth which any institution must pass through in its early stages of development."" [A/ 8701/Add. 1  p.2.JI fully share the Secretary-General's view.52.	While frankly admitting the shortcomings and limitations of the United Nations  Japan is fully aware of the importance of the role it is playing in today's world and is determined to do its utmost for the consolidation and advancement of that role. In this regard  I was very much impressed by the remarks made the day before yesterday by Mr. Rogers  Secretary of State of the United States  on the role to be played by Japan [2038th meeting  para. 64].53.	I sincerely hope that this session of the General Assembly  recognizing the fact that the future of the United Nations depends entirely on the determination of its Member States  will succeed in achieving meaningful results in international co-operation and in the constructive and just settlement of the various questions now before us."
"63",3673,"KEN",27,1972,"): I should first of all like to convey the greetings of the President of Kenya  H.E. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta  to the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.2.	My delegation also wishes to convey its felicitations to the newly elected President of the General Assembly  Mr. S. Trepczynski  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic. With his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations  his wide experience and exceptional ability  the present session should sail to a successful conclusion.3.	The outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  conducted the business of the twenty-sixth session with dispatch  fairness and exceptional skill. To him we express our deep gratitude.4.	My delegation deems it appropriate to address a word of welcome to the new Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has  indeed  inherited an exacting job. We have no doubt that  with his proven competence and total commitment to what the United Nations stands for  he will perform brilliantly in his high position of service to humanity at large. Those of us who know the Secretary-General well are conversant with his deep interest in Africa. His sustained efforts to promote decolonization and development have been noted with appreciation throughout Africa. His deep commitment to accelerated disarmament is also very well known and appreciated in our continent.5.	Every year we congregate ritually in New York for the General Assembly session. Every year we return to our countries having passed a vast number of resolutions and having poured out endless rhetoric that gets recorded in documents of the United Nations that are produced by the ton. However  strangely enough  a program of action  particularly in the political arena  is conspicuous by its absence; expressions of pious hope find no concrete reality; swelling rumbles of economic discontent pass unnoticed; threats to peace continue in ever-widening dimensions. International issues of a complex nature are tainted by competing ideologies and cold war politics and polemics. The Security Council finds itself locked in bitter debate and magnificent inaction in emergency situations. The liberation of over 30 million enslaved and colonially dominated Africans still remains an undischarged responsibility on the part of the international community. Escalation of conflict through massive injections of sophisticated arms to areas of potential and actual war are too frequent. Economic development in the third world remains at an embryonic stage. World markets  advanced technology and international finance are still the zealously guarded preserves of the affluent States. Although new horizons are opening up in space technology  the exploitation of resources of the sea and the application of environmental controls  it remains to be seen how the newly emergent nations would share the ensuing benefits.6.	It is necessary that certain basic needs be met before peace can triumph over conflict  before understanding can dispel mistrust  and before co-operation can replace political inducements and friction.7.	The primary need must necessarily be that the interests of nations  small and large  rich and poor  are equitably accommodated to promote peace. It is necessary that international relations must be democratized to enhance understanding  promote co-operation and ease tension.8.	The historic visits of President Nixon  first to China and later to the Soviet Union  have set in motion the process of detente. This is of monumental importance to orderly world relations and must be carried out to more extensive limits. It is only through personal contact  the objective evaluation of the inextricably bound up interests of all nations  the acknowledgment of existing realities and a certain grant of mutual concessions  that tension can be lessened.9.	East and West Germany have constructively and positively adopted this approach  which promises to bring ultimate political stability  understanding and co-operation to Europe  long and repeatedly subjected to the savagery and horror of countless wars.A/PV.203910.	The recent dialog between North and South Korea  after years of bloodshed  sustained propaganda and incalculable loss of life and property  is another forceful reminder of the wisdom of a policy of conciliation and restraint as compared with that of armed confrontation and naked aggression.11.	The decades-old bitter dispute between India and Pakistan  which was responsible for four devastating wars in 25 years  has also been made amenable to peaceful settlement through direct contact between the leaders of the two countries. That is why my country warmly welcomed the Simla Agreement for the normalization of relations between the two countries.12.	In the same context I cannot but hope earnestly that the tragic and prolonged war in Viet-Nam will also respond to the same process. Negotiations in Paris to terminate this war seem to be making satisfactory progress. We long for the day when  through negotiation  a permanent  equitable and honorable settlement will be arrived at  not in the field of battle but round a conference table.13.	Kenya applied the same sentiments and hopes to the situation in the Middle East where no peace has been known for almost a generation and where blood-letting  reprisal measures and indiscriminate loss of life and property characterize relations among the embattled nations. ""Die Kenya Government continues to hope that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) will prove to be the corner-stone for a just  durable  and an expeditious settlement of the Middle East crisis.14.	I should also refer to some of the most explosive disputes that were defused peacefully on the African continent. I need only refer to the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  which met in June 1972 in Rabat  where Algeria and Morocco buried the hatchet over the territorial dispute that had plagued their relations for a number of years. This is what we call in Africa today ""the spirit of Rabat"". We hope it will spread like wildfire to all other troubled spots in the world.15.	We certainly hope that the spirit of Rabat will prevail over the present troubled situation in East Africa which imperils the traditionally fraternal relations among the countries of the region. My Government will steadfastly work for the peaceful solution of any problems that have arisen and will demonstrate in action its deep concern for the preservation of the East African community and for the smooth running of its common services. Our salvation lies in accommodation  not confrontation; in peace  not warfare; in understanding  not acrimony. Our common destiny  future aspirations and past heritage only emphasize this necessity.16.	The next cardinal responsibility that we must discharge is that of eradicating colonialism once and for all. Despite the fact that the world has witnessed an era of decolonization where no fewer than 41 States attained independence and sovereign equality in the comity of free nations  vast areas in Africa remain afflicted with minority racist regimes. Millions of Africans in South Africa  Zimbabwe  Namibia  Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are held in colonial bondage by supremacist and unrepresentative orders.17.	The Africans  under repressive laws and police terror  are denied fundamental rights to life  liberty and property. The rule of law does not exist. Judicial safeguards such as they exist in theory are fictional. Arbitrary exercise of authority and abuse of discretionary powers are commonplace and highly rewarded. Large-scale eviction of Africans from settled areas and their replacement by whites from the unemployment pools of Europe is the official policy  which is being carried out ruthlessly without ever arousing qualms of conscience in anyone in authority. Generous supplies of military hardware to the supremacist regimes flow in from countries which never tire of proclaiming their love for liberty  equality and fraternity. Actually they play the role of death merchants under the guise of angels of peace and security. They are openly militarizing the racists to increase their oppressive capacity and to enforce their racist laws with unprecedented harshness. The immense natural resources of these captive lands are exploited to enrich the racist overlords  who live affluently by the toil  tears and sweat of the Africans. Apartheid  the epitome of racism and organized State terror  is being systematically and unashamedly extended to Namibia and Rhodesia.18. In Zimbabwe the categorical rejection of the Anglo- Rhodesian settlement terms by the overwhelming majority of the people of Zimbabwe must be followed by concrete steps  such as the following:(a)	A constitutional conference of all interested parties should be convened under the aegis of the United Nations. The fundamental purpose of the conference would be to accelerate the advance to African majority rule in Zimbabwe.(b)	The scheme of sanctions should be strengthened and stringently applied. The sanctions should be made more comprehensive and should be applied to the ports of Beira and Lourenzo Marques.(c)	Any country that commits violations of the United Nations-imposed sanctions should be identified and exposed. Member States of the United Nations may thereafter invoke such retaliatory action as they deem appropriate with regard to the offending States.(d)	The United Nations should consider recommending to States the refusal of landing rights to national airlines which land at Salisbury and whose Governments permit Rhodesian airplanes to land in their countries.(e)	All postal  telegraphic and related communications between Rhodesia and the States Members of the United Nations should be cut off.(f)	The United Nations should work out a scheme of confiscation of Rhodesian exports of tobacco  asbestos  chrome and other Rhodesian minerals at the place of entry in the importing country.(g)	Ways and means should be found to secure the expulsion of the South African military units and police contingents now stationed in Rhodesia.(h)	All Governments  organizations and private institutions should be urged to render moral and material assistance to the liberation movements of Zimbabwe  which operate both internally and externally  in order to oblige Smith to disgorge his political power in Rhodesia.(i) All States bordering Rhodesia which fear aggression from Rhodesia  South Africa and the ruling Portuguese clique should be given guarantees of protection by the United Nations. Considering the armed aggression that continues to be unleashed systematically by the Portuguese colonialists against Guinea  Senegal  Zambia and the United Republic of Tanzania  the need for such guarantees is obvious. What is most important is that these guarantees should be made enforceable and should not remain mere paper commitments.19.	With regard to Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau)  increased assistance of every form to the gallant liberation movements operating in those Territories is essential. Already vast areas have been liberated. Rehabilitation facilities are being made available with the assistance of world churches and other Governments  institutions and individuals that espouse the cause of African independence. The enlightened elements within Portugal  aware of the turbulent winds of change  must recognize the futility of a Portuguese colonial war in Africa. The States Members of the United Nations must not be fooled into believing that weapons and equipment supplied to Portugal through the sources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] for the defense of Europe are not systematically channeled into the Portuguese Territories to annihilate the African aspirations to independence.20.	Large countries which are friendly to both Africa and Portugal and which share and maintain political  social and cultural ties with Portugal can exercise decisive influence in changing oppressive Portuguese policies. Such countries are sympathizers with the African cause for freedom and independence. We should ask them to use their unique position and good offices to advance self-determination in the Portuguese Territories in Africa.21.	With regard to Namibia  my Government shall support every endeavor aimed at securing an effective United Nations presence and control in this Territory. This is in conformity with the decision on Namibia taken by the International Court of Justice  last year   the resolutions of the General Assembly and the various decisions of the Security Council on this subject. I also wish to register the strongest condemnation and indignation on the part of my Government at the attempts being made by South Africa to extend the discredited system of apartheid to Namibia. The spontaneous and wide-spread reaction against this policy in so-called native homelands constitutes a clear verdict of its rejection by the people of Namibia as a whole.22.	The position of free Africa on the vital question of decolonization is crystal clear. We have made every concession  explored every possibility and consulted every interested party to arrive at a peaceful solution. However  all these efforts have been met with an unresponsive  rigid and uncompromising stance. Faced with this attitude of the minority regimes of southern Africa on the one hand and the immense suffering of the African people on the other  Africa can only work for a peaceful solution if possible  for diplomatic accommodation if just  and for resort to arms if necessary. All these options have been kept open.23.	The Committee of Liberation of the OAU is continuing with the armed struggle designed to liquidate colonialism and its last vestiges from the soil of Africa. We ask for the help of every State member of OAU  the non-aligned movement and the United Nations in the discharge of this sacred and inescapable duty. We ask for this help in the interests of world peace  justice and the orderly conduct of inter-State relations throughout the world.24.	The OAU mission on decolonization has traveled extensively and explained free Africa's viewpoint to leading world capitals. The results of this exercise have been encouraging. Enlightened world opinion  exposed to the new depths of savagery of the colonial regimes  has rallied to the African cause of freedom and independence. The World Council of Churches  the Governments of Denmark  Norway and Sweden and many private institutions and individuals have given assistance to the victims of colonial aggression in those Territories. Swedish and Italian firms have been persuaded to withdraw their participation from the Cabora Bassa project in Mozambique. In the present circumstances it can only be regarded as a colossal scheme of exploitation of the vast natural resources of Mozambique. It is also noteworthy that member States of NATO  like Norway  have in the NATO Councils openly condemned Portuguese colonialism in Africa. We appeal to the other members of that alliance to emulate the courageous Norwegian move  which will greatly accelerate decolonization in the Portuguese-held Territories of Africa.25.	Now that world opinion is focused on the untold suffering  injustice and humiliation heaped on the colonized people  the United Nations must give a renewed lead to liquidate colonialism and its consequences from the world scene.26.	Political independence by itself lacks substance unless it is complemented by economic freedom. This can only be derived from developing a self-generating economy to produce wealth for the benefit of all the citizens of a State. To achieve this objective all national resources  human and material  must be marshaled intelligently for nation- building on a basis of self-reliance. Foreign aid alone is not sufficient for nation-building; the self-help effort is of paramount importance in reducing total dependence on foreign aid.27.	The development effort must be identified with intensified trade and co-operation  diversification of industry  modernization of agriculture  and the provision of facilities for employment  education  social welfare  and so on. This exercise  in turn  can only produce beneficial results if it is based on access to technology  capital and planning techniques. If their proper utilization in the development endeavor can be ensured  corrosive poverty can be eradicated  wide-spread illiteracy progressively reduced and rampant disease substantially controlled.28.	On the international plane the developing countries in collectivity must gain liberal market access in the developed countries for their primary commodities and manufactured and semi-manufactured articles. Newly emergent nations must ensure that they enjoy an increasing share in world trade  which has been markedly shrinking every year.Stability of prices for their primary commodities must be secured if their fragile economies are to withstand success-fully the thrusts of unpredictable economic changes. International monetary reforms must take account of the vital interests of developing countries  whose economic system can fall an easy prey to the decisions of a few rich countries. The development endeavor can only become concrete and effective if transfer and implantation of technology in developing countries can be achieved. It is necessary that the receiving State should be able to develop technical capacity as well as a capacity for inventiveness. This should be the essential role of technical assistance and co-operation. All these objectives form part of the International Development Strategy for the implementation of the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is therefore essential that  through a co-ordinated exercise  the developing countries in collectivity exert maximum pressure on every platform to achieve the objectives outlined above.29.	The developing countries must take full advantage of the new vistas opened by science and technology in the field of outer space and the environs of the oceans.30.	New scientific and technological break-through have enabled man to exploit the vast resources of the oceans and the seas which have been inaccessible hitherto. It is now universally recognized that these resources  beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  constitute the common heritage of mankind and are not subject to national appropriation by any State  and that this area should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. It remains to give substance and detail to these important principles. This should be done through effective international machinery and subject to equitable and orderly exploitation and utilization of the resources of the sea for the development of all countries.31.	It will of interest to the General Assembly to note that my country put proposals to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction which met in Geneva [A/8721  pp. 180-182]. We have proposed the establishment of exclusive economic zones beyond national waters for the primary benefit of the peoples of the coastal areas and of their economies. It is intended that such States should exercise sovereign rights over natural resources within the economic zone for purposes of the exploration and exploitation of living and non-living resources of the sea and for research. Such States should be empowered to prevent and control pollution without prejudice to freedom of navigation  freedom of over-flight and freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines in conformity with recognized principles of international law. It should be noted that our proposal expressly guarantees the rights of land-locked States of every description. We hope that it will be received sympathetically by States Members of the United Nations.32.	Environmental control is a subject that has aroused intense interest on the part of every State throughout the world. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment recognized that for developing countries the problems of the human environment arise from conditions of poverty and underdevelopment  whereas for developed nations such problems arise from affluence and pollution. We must ensure that these questions of the human environment are treated within the context of development. Therefore all environmental actions of the United Nations must be integrated within the existing objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade.33.	The Stockholm Conference recommended the establishment of a 54-member governing council for environmental programs.  The capital of my country  Nairobi  was mentioned as a possible location for its secretariat. My Government would be happy to accept that suggestion.34.	In conclusion  I have outlined my Government's position on some of the fundamental issue: t :at confront us today. In the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in conformity with its aims and objectives  the world community  through the United Nations  must work together for the liberation of the colonially-dominated peoples  for the economic advancement of all peoples  for the conquest of disease and illiteracy and for the improvement of our environment and the exploitation of the vast resources of the sea for the benefit of all peoples. Let us work to replace confrontation with negotiation  mistrust with good faith and impressive rhetoric with effective action."
"64",3744,"KHM",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I at the outset  on behalf of my delegation and personally  offer you our warmest congratulations on being elected to preside over the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your unanimous choice as President is a tribute paid at one and the same time to the heroic Polish people and to you  whose prestige and competence are guarantees of the successful conduct of the work of the Assembly.125.	I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and to inform him of how much my Government appreciates his constant and devoted efforts to achieve detente and international co-operation. In these delicate circumstances where  in a world ravaged by conflict  there is at last a slight glimmer of peace  we are happy to find in our Secretary-General all the necessary qualifications to assist us together to find the appropriate ways and means of keeping alive and even increasing that glimmer of peace for the greater welfare of mankind.126.	At the same time  I should like to endorse  with great gratitude  what has been said by eminent representatives who have preceded me  in paying tribute also to our outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  for his patient and unflagging efforts in the search of a just and lasting peace in the world  and particularly  in our region of South-East Asia.127.	While I am addressing you  the Khmer people  innocent victims of an unjustified and unjustifiable foreign aggression  is still suffering in its own flesh and blood. Its sufferings are such that neither the comfort nor the ultramodern installations of this glass palace  nor the distance that separates me from my country  can banish from my mind the image of the ghastly spectacle of the exactions committed by the invaders against our civilian population: women mourning their husbands; children  their mothers; monks  their monasteries that have been devastated; and the refugees  their lost homes.128.	In this abyss of suffering  where its North VietNamese neighbors have plunged it without reason  the Khmer people is struggling with courage and determination for its destiny  its survival and its very existence as a nation. It is that very conviction that is our strength  a moral strength that no subversive campaign and no weapon can weaken. In this struggle to liberate out country from the claws of foreign invaders that are militarily better equipped and better trained  the Khmer people needs  if not assistance  at least understanding and encouragement from all the peoples who have committed themselves formally to honoring the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.129.	More than at any other time in its existence  the Khmer people has realized how great is the danger for mankind if the United Nations does not intervene to help to call an immediate halt to a systematic and foolhardy aggression on the part of North Viet-Nam against a peaceful people  whose only crime has been that of wishing to live in peace within its own frontiers and with good understanding with all nations  particularly  its neighbors  without any distinctions of ideology  race  religion or system of Government.130.	A State that recovered its independence and sovereignty in 1953 and a Member of the United Nations since 1955  Cambodia then and the Khmer Republic now has given proof of being an exemplary Member  one which  in all circumstances  in peace as in war  has always scrupulously complied with the principles of the Charter and the agreements and commitments it has assumed. Unfortunately  our conduct did not prevent open aggression  an attack inflicted with impunity by the troops of North Viet-Nam and the Viet-Cong. This can be no other than deliberate aggression  since the Khmer Republic and the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam have no common frontier  being separated one from the other by the Kingdom of Laos and the Republic of Viet-Nam.131.	This aggression is all the more unjustifiable since it is against a neutral and peaceful State  a demographically and militarily weaker country that has never threatened any other nation. Deeply imbued with the principles of Buddha  the Khmer people  with its 3 500 monasteries and its 70 000 monks in a population of 7 million inhabitants that is  one monastery for each 2 000 inhabitants and one monk for each 100 persons is reputed to be one of the most peaceful peoples of the world.132.	Furthermore  after the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements of 1954  my country has never joined any military pact and never authorized the installation of any foreign base of any sort on our territory until the last years of the 1960s when its ex-Head of State  Sihanouk  in a secret agreement  without the knowledge of the Khmer Government and Parliament  authorized the clandestine installation of sanctuaries for the North Viet-Minh and Viet-Cong. It was from those bases that the 60 000 North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong soldiers in March of 1970 launched their open attacks against Khmer army that had only 32 000 men  despite people's demonstrations in the provinces  as well as in the capital  that requested their withdrawal from Khmer territory.133.	In the light of that situation  the Khmer people had no other choice but to organize itself for resistance  a national resistance that was and is a typical case of legitimate self-defense as provided for in the Geneva Agreements of 1954 as well as in the Charter of the United Nations.134.	Evidence mounts day by day  attesting to the increased atrocities committed not only against our defense forces  but  over and above all  against our civilian population  our children  our Buddhist monks  our doctors  without counting the manifold destruction caused to our economic  cultural and social infrastructure  or the acts of terrorism committed against peaceful inhabitants in their towns and villages. This aggression  which is an obvious fact  is amply proved by the many captured weapons and documents as well as by the declarations of North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong prisoners held at present in Phnom Penh. A number of foreign observers that have free access to Khmer territory since April of 1970 no longer challenge the reality of this invasion despite the efforts of enemy propaganda to camouflage it by representing its four North Vietnamese divisions (the first  fifth  seventh and the ninth) and the C-40 Viet-Cong regiment as the so-called army of Sihanouk.135.	In fact  besides those 60 000 North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong invaders  there are barely 30 000 ""red Khmers""  of which 6 000 rallied to the legal Government as of last 30 August. Furthermore  the latter are made up of disparate elements  the overwhelming majority of which do not even make use of the name of Sihanouk in their own propaganda within the country  knowing that that name is rejected by the Khmer people. Moreover  they constitute neither an army nor a political force  since they are used only for propaganda and as arms carriers for the aggressors  or are forced to perform minor tasks of supply and logistics.136.	Obviously  the consequences of North Vietnamese aggression have been cruelly felt by the Khmer Republic and its people.137.	About one third of the 181 000 square kilometers of the territory is still under the occupation by the forces of the aggressors  who have endeavored to sow terrorism and insecurity wherever they have been able to do so. Approximately one seventh of our population of 7 million are forced to live under the control of the enemy under a regime of terror imposed by the invaders.138.	It is out of fear of suffering enemy occupation that our peasants  usually deeply attached to their rice fields and their native soil  have not hesitated to flee their lands in order to seek refuge in the zones controlled by the Government. Thus far  approximately 700 000 refugees have fled to the capital and the main provincial towns. This immense exodus has caused an imbalance in the demographic structure of the country  with over-population in that part of the territory which remains free and under- population in that part occupied by the aggressors.139.	In August last  after having conducted massive bombing of the civilian population and used some hundred heavy ultramodern tanks against our defense forces  the North Vietnamese invasion forces used poisonous gas shells  which are weapons strictly prohibited by international conventions.140.	The occupiers are attacking our communications lines  our works of art  our public utilities administrative buildings  hospitals  infirmaries  schools  plantations  plants  industrial enterprises  and so on.141.	Furthermore  these invaders did not even respect the works being carried out under the auspices of the United Nations to help the developing countries. The most shocking proof of this was the attack planned and carried out in 1971 against the construction sites of the Prek Thnot Dam  which is located in the Province of Kompong Speu and is intended to irrigate vast areas of land for the benefit of the people.142.	Therefore  our enemies do not even spare the undertakings of an economic and social nature of the United Nations itself.143.	Special mention must also be made of the depredation and occupation of our monuments at Angkor by the Viet-Cong troops  contrary to international law  particularly the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict  done at The Hague on 14 May 1954. The danger is all the greater since the invaders  after the armed occupation of that zone  have turned it into a veritable logistics and military base by digging bunkers and building other defenses without having shown the slightest regard for these vast monuments that are considered and admitted by all nations as being one of the richest cultural treasures of mankind.144.	Since 11 June 1971  the Government of the Khmer Republic  profoundly concerned by the fate of these occupied monuments  appealed to all Governments and all men of goodwill all over the world to help neutralize the Angkor zone and place it under international control.145.	In this connexion I should like to express  on behalf of my Government  our warmest thanks to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our Secretary-General  and to Mr. René Maheu  the Director-General of UNESCO  for the great efforts they made before they succeeded in having the Angkor monuments listed under the special protection of the above- mentioned Convention.146.	We are glad to mention that on 25 August last the period for objection to that listing expired. We therefore appeal to all the signatory States of this Convention  as well as to all the Governments of the world  actively to help from now on  by joint efforts within the framework of the Convention  to preserve these monuments from destruction and damage due to enemy occupation.147.	For its part  the Khmer Government has taken all the necessary precautions under The Hague Convention to avoid any damage to this heritage of mankind.148.	For all the reasons I have just mentioned  it appears to us urgent that the international community at last take effective action to put an end as soon as possible to North Viet-Nam and Viet-Cong aggression against the Khmer Republic. This foreign aggression  which is continuing even today with increased intensity  constitutes a grave threat not only to the existence of the Khmer people but also to that of all the neighboring peoples  which are peaceful and do not have any expansionist designs.149.	In the Khmer Republic there is only one struggle: the national struggle of the Khmer people to free its country from these invaders. In the Khmer Republic today there is only one foreign aggression: the North VietNamese and Viet-Cong aggression  because there are neither American troops nor American military bases on our soil. In contending that they are ""liberating"" us  the foreign invaders are in fact only seeking to liberate the Khmer country from the Khmers. Is that not a true definition of annexationism  of colonialism or of imperialism? 150.	This aggression is in clear and open defiance of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and of the fundamental principles of our Organization  which advocate respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries  large and small  non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries  and non-aggression and peaceful coexistence among all political and social systems.151.	This barbarous aggression  of which the Khmer people is the victim  has only one positive aspect  that of having awakened and consolidated our national consciousness in the face of the threats of the enemy from outside.152.	That aggression  regardless of the atrocities committed  has still not sapped or weakened our firm determination to create a new society based upon the principles of democracy  that is  that all power comes from the people and that only the people is sovereign.153.	Responding thus to the aspirations of its people  the Government of the Khmer Republic has specifically laid down the groundwork for democracy by establishing republican institutions.154.	The Khmer people has definitively renounced a traditionally feudal monarchy and adopted a republican constitution on 30 April 1972  after a national referendum.155.	In the presidential elections of 4 June 1972  the Khmer people by universal and direct suffrage elected Marshal Lon No! as the first President of the Republic. The first National Assembly and the first Senate of the Khmer Republic were respectively elected on 3 and 17 September last.156.	This change of political regime was due to the fact that the Khmer people no longer wished to tolerate the excesses of its monarchs who  during 2 000 years  kept the people in slavery. All the Khmers remember the dictatorial methods with which the former King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk  who later became Head of State  led our country. We still remember too well the hundreds of Khmer patriots who were summarily and savagely executed on his orders  accused solely of being Communists and so forth  whereas in reality they merely opposed his anachro-nistic regime.157.	I must restate that the removal of Sihanouk from power was not the result of a coup d'etat  as some of his friends of the moment contend  but it was a legal deposition  carried out in accordance with the constitution then in force. Raised to the highest office of the country by the Khmer Parliament 12 years ago  Sihanouk was deposed by that same Parliament by the unanimous vote of its members on 18 March 1970.158.	All this shows how ridiculous and irrelevant were the words pronounced yesterday by the representative of the People's Republic of the Congo when he referred to my Government and our republican regime. That representative was hardly the one to refer to us as ""a clique thrown out by the people"" [2045th meeting  para. 238] and boast of the merits of a prince in exile when that representative himself represents a clique which  not long ago  eliminated a leader risen from the people  President Massemba Debat and as everyone knows by hardly democratic means.159.	Does one call it ""a clique thrown out by the people"" when one speaks of a President of a Republic and a Parliament elected by universal and direct suffrage?160.	Does one call a ""legal Head of State"" of a country a Head of State who  having betrayed the higher interests of his people  was deposed by the unanimous vote of the two Houses of Parliament?161.	We deny that representative of the People's Republic of the Congo any right to interfere in the domestic affairs of our country or to claim to know them better than we do.162.	In brief  in his zeal to plead in favor of a Government-in-exile that represents no one but itself and that was so truly ""thrown out by the people"" that it is still permanently located on foreign soil  Mr. Henri Lopes is doing less than justice to the People's Republic of China when he compares the rights of the latter in the United Nations with those of the so-called Royal Government of Sihanouk.163.	Although deeply concerned over the bitter struggle to survive against an enemy which is particularly ferocious and which is determined to wipe it from the map of the world  my country has at no time overlooked or ignored its duties and its obligations as a Member of the United Nations. Thus my country continues and will continue unflaggingly to participate actively in the work of our Organization in the various fields of international cooperation.164.	We remain fundamentally opposed to racial discrimination in all its forms or manifestations and wherever it may appear. It is in fact inadmissible that human beings today can still be victims of discrimination of any sort because they belong to one race or another  one religion or another  one color or another  or one ethnic group or another.165.	The Khmer people has always rejected any form of discrimination  because nothing would  be more contrary to our Buddhist principles  which are primarily based upon tolerance  compassion and respect for all living beings.166.	Thus  too  our traditions of resistance and particularly our present-day struggle to repulse the foreign invasion can only strengthen day by day our constant and sincere determination to uphold the genuine movements of liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke. What we refuse to accept is that the sacred term ""the liberation struggle"" should be used to camouflage the realities of aggression. We therefore strongly oppose those pseudo-liberator. movements which  under the pretext of freeing one country or another that has already gained its independence  interfere in the domestic affairs of that country and  in fact  practice expansionism and annexationism to the detriment of other countries.167.	With regard to the so-called ""divided-country problem""  the Khmer people welcome with satisfaction the latest developments towards detente and peaceful coexistence of those with different political and social systems. In accordance with our own aspirations for peace and international co-operaticfn  we trust that that trend towards reconciliation will be strengthened on the basis of reciprocity  mutual respect and the principles established to govern relations among States  pending a reunification that must be achieved according to the principles of self- determination  without foreign interference and  if necessary  with the assistance of international organizations.168.	As one of the peoples that has suffered from acts of terrorism on the part of our invaders  the Khmer people can only express its gratitude for any initiative taken to prevent such crimes against humanity. Our delegation hopes that without passion or prejudice  the United Nations  aware of what has occurred  will give urgent attention to this problem in order scientifically to devise appropriate and suitable concrete means to combat effectively this type of crime  condemned as it is by all civilized peoples.169.	While welcoming the recent developments leading to the reduction of tension in the world  and particularly in Asia  we must voice our hope for a successful conclusion of the talks on general and complete disarmament.170.	With regard to the conflict in Viet-Nam  we are relieved to note that a number of initiatives for peace have been undertaken  not only by the great Powers  including the United States of America and the Soviet Union  but also on the part of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  namely  Indonesia  Malaysia  Thailand  the Philippines and Singapore.171.	The Government of the Khmer Republic feels that the Vietnamese conflict cannot be successfully and justly solved unless there is a global solution  namely  a general cease-fire in the whole Indochinese peninsula  followed by the withdrawal of foreign troops from each of the three countries: the Kingdom of Laos  the Republic of Viet-Nam and the Khmer Republic.172.	We are always ready to contribute to a peaceful settlement in order to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Khmer territory on the basis of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and in accordance with the joint communique in May 1970 at the Djakarta Conference on Cambodia. The Khmer problems will be solved by the Khmers themselves  without any foreign interference.173.	The situation in the Khmer Republic is a typical case of foreign aggression  open and blatant  against a people that has not crossed its frontiers by one millimeter to threaten any other country or attack it.174.	Such a situation must be one that confronts the world with a moral issue.175.	A small country such as mine must wonder whether the innocence of a people and its scrupulous respect for the principles of the Charter and of international law could be considered to be sufficient guarantees of peace or whether the crime of aggression is to continue to go unpunished after 27 years of the existence of the United Nations.176.	As I said earlier  at this very moment while I am addressing you  my compatriots are still suffering in their struggle to defend a cause that could not be more just or legitimate. Your words  Mr. President  spoken on ^September  echo particularly our own hearts when  speaking of Poland  you said:""My country owes its existence  its freedom  its independence and its present dynamic development to great effort on the part of its people  but also to tremendous sacrifices. This unites us with the many peoples of the different continents for whom the struggle for freedom was a struggle for national existence."" [2032nd meeting  para. 55.]111. The Khmer people is today doing nothing but fighting for its national existence; and it was in that spirit that Marshal Lon Nol  President of our Republic  when speaking to the Deputies on 14 September last on the occasion of the opening of the National Assembly  said:""The North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong Communists that so savagely attacked our country have not only sown death and ruin but  over and above all  they have showed the criminal intention of killing our new Republic at its inception. They want to restore a reactionary regime that is obedient to them and that has worked to ensure their expansionist and imperialist aims. They have imposed on us a war without mercy. The Khmer people has  however  taken up the challenge. Young and old  civilians and soldiers  all have rallied to the defense of their country in danger. Their sacrifices have allowed our nation to reject the foreign yoke and to live freely and independently thus far.""178.	For these reasons  the Khmer people are fighting and will fight with determination and energy against the foreign invaders. Like all peoples throughout universal history  the-Khmer people continues to have faith in the sacred principles which are the foundation of our Organization and of the dignity of man."
"65",3858,"KWT",27,1972,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to express to you on behalf of the Government of the State of Kuwait heartfelt congratulations on your election to your high office. I should like to commend the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience and an outstanding reputation. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  for the manner in which he presided over the past session of the General Assembly. May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Waldheim  our Secretary-General  on his assumption of the responsibilities of Secretary-General of the United Nations. His indefatigable energy and zeal and his long diplomatic experience augur well for the future of our Organization.152.	Kuwait welcomes the symptoms of detente and reconciliation which are visible in many parts of the world  especially in the relations between the big Powers. Several recent developments on the world political scene may truly be said to mark an era of change. The Moscow agreements  imposing certain quantitative limitations on strategic nuclear weapon systems  have given rise to great hopes that they will be followed by additional measures in the field of disarmament and open new vistas of co-operation in all aspects of international relations. While expressing satisfaction with the new trend we should  however  express our profound belief that amity among big Powers should never be achieved at the expense of the small countries and that co-operation among the super-Powers should not imply dividing the world into spheres of influence or establishing a partnership in world hegemony.153.	Our attitude is in conformity with the policy of the non-aligned countries which during the Conference of their Foreign Ministers held in August in Guyana  affirmed their adherence to the policy of non-alignment and their anxiety to maintain the international balance of power and to protect the small countries from becoming tools in the hands of the big Powers.154.	The entry into force of the treaties between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany  as well as the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin have removed the major obstacles to the development of constructive co-operation among all the countries of the European continent. The preparations for the convening of a European conference on security and co-operation are further evidence of the relaxation of international tension and the improvement of relations between the socialist and Western countries.155.	These political improvements create a favorable atmosphere for the intensification of efforts towards disarmament. Kuwait supported the proposal to hold a world disarmament conference. One of the basic prerequisites for the success of the conference would be to secure universal participation in the conference. We hope that the projected world disarmament conference would provide the right forum for a universal effort to achieve our common goal of general and complete disarmament. However  the conference should adopt as one of its basic principles the necessity of allocating a major part of the resources released by the reduction of military budgets to the economic and social development of the developing countries.156.	May I express the satisfaction of the Government of Kuwait with the encouraging developments in the negotiations for the reunification of North and South Korea? Kuwait  which is opposed to the partition of any country and which steadfastly upholds the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States  sincerely hopes that the reunification of Korea will be achieved peacefully and without foreign interference and that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Korea.157.	The goals of the United Nations are of such a nature as virtually to require universal membership for their successful fulfillment. We hope that countries which have not yet been admitted to the United Nations will soon take their seats in this hall. Meanwhile  we would like non- members to take an active part in the activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies  as no doubt they can make a valuable contribution to the work of our Organization. The restitution of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China was a major international event which brought our Organization nearer to achieving the goal of universality. China has already demonstrated its role as an independent great Power which is not involved in the conflict between the two camps. Its presence among us has reinforced the ranks of the developing countries who see in China a reliable ally and a true friend.158.	The President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development painted a grim picture of the conditions of life for the 40 per cent of the world population who live in the developing countries. He blamed the advanced countries for failing to fulfill the 1 per cent target of providing aid to the developing countries during the Second United Nations Development Decade. He also predicted that the developing countries would not be able to attain the agreed target of 6 per cent of economic growth each year.159.	This is a realistic evaluation following the outcome of the third session of UNCTAD  held at Santiago in April and May  which gave rise to wide disappointment and disillusionment. The ill-will which lurks behind the reluctance of the advanced countries to provide aid and outlets for the exports of the developing countries is a matter of serious concern to all of us as it prevents the fulfillment of the aims of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].160.	I hope that events will disprove these predictions and that there.  will be a change of heart among the rich countries  which will realize that much more is at stake than the question of trade and development. Poverty is a deadly enemy of mankind that dwells at the root of most world problems. It is not yet too late to wage a war against poverty and to collaborate in providing for all people the blessings of social welfare and prosperity.161.	Rejoicing over the relaxation of international tension in some areas should not divert our attention from deep-rooted problems in other areas of the world in which no progress towards solution has been experienced  but should rather stimulate redoubled efforts by the international community to deal effectively with those problems  the continuation of which constitutes a permanent threat to international peace and security and a perpetual challenge to the ideals and purposes of the Charter.162.	The international order continues to be confronted with its gravest challenges in South-East Asia  in West Asia and in southern Africa. In each of these regions the rules of civilized conduct and of international law continue to be violated daily; contempt for the value of human life continues to be manifested in its ugliest forms; and the fruits of modern civilization-organization and technology continue to be employed for destruction and defilement of those very values and principles without which civilization cannot flourish.163.	The year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly has witnessed in Viet-Nam an escalation of violence-in its instruments and methods  as well as in the pretexts for its use. In the Middle East and in southern Africa  on the other hand  it has witnessed continuing attempts to entrench the faits accomplis which have been achieved by aggression  usurpation and racist domination  and by continued disregard for the international will.164.	The essential similarity between the regimes which are responsible for the rise and exacerbation of the deep-rooted problems in southern Africa and the Middle East has become quite evident. In each of those two regions we see regimes of alien colonists established through the usurpation of the homelands and property of indigenous peoples  and the subjugation or dispersion of those peoples in accordance with the precepts of the racist policy which is the raison d'etre of the regimes in question meet every struggle for national liberation with ruthless suppression and official governmental terrorism.165.	If we focus our attention on the situation in the Middle East we will observe that it has recently been characterized as far as the Israeli occupation of territories of neighboring Arab States is concerned-by two principal features: first  the suspension of international efforts to achieve a political settlement; and  second  the escalation of Israeli endeavors to transform the temporary military occupation into permanent de facto control and eventually into de jure expansionist annexation.166.	Responsibility for the suspension of international efforts to achieve a political settlement has been formally established by the General Assembly in its resolution 2799 (XXVI)  in which ""the positive reply given by Egypt to the Special Representative's initiative for establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East "" was noted with appreciation; while Israel was asked ""to respond favorably"" to that initiative. But Israel's position has not changed since the adoption of that resolution  and the international initiatives have therefore been suspended.167.	It is imperative that this clear Israeli responsibility for the frustration and resultant suspension of international initiatives aimed at achieving a just and peaceful settlement of the crisis of the Middle East be borne in mind when the renewal of such initiatives is considered. For it was Israel's rejection of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war or conquest and its rejection of the practical corollary thereof  namely  the mandatory withdrawal from the occupied territories  that was the rock on which all international initiatives have founded whether those taken by the United Nations or within its framework  or those taken by individual States or groups of States.168.	Israel's responsibility for frustrating all attempts at achieving a peaceful settlement of the problem also reveals the spuriousness of its claimed longing for peace.169.	Questions or doubts in the mind of observers of the Middle East situation about the reason why Israel deliberately aborts every international effort to attain a peaceful settlement in the region while its leaders ceaselessly voice an alleged aspiration for peace find their answer in Israel's policies and practices in the territories occupied since 1967. Those territories have been the scene of tireless Israeli efforts to eliminate their Arab character and to replace it by an Israeli character-demographically  culturally  socially  economically and juridically. This program  in turn  is calculated to serve the Israeli policy of transforming the status of the occupied territories: from that of territories under military occupation  through a transitional period in which they are annexed by Israel in fact but not in name  to the final status of Israeli territories in the full sense of the term. This is the policy of annexation through conquest  the policy of expansion through war  the policy of the acquisition of territories by force  which is outlawed in the Charter and declared by the Security Council and the General Assembly in a number of resolutions to be inadmissible and incompatible with the principles of the international community and the rules of international law.170.	The Israeli practices of oppression in the occupied territories and the clear-cut violations of the norms of humane  civilized conduct  as well as the rules of international law  particularly those enshrined in the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949   are thus but Israel's means of overcoming the obstacles which stand in the way of its achieving its expansionist aims.171.	It will be recalled that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories  established by the General Assembly  has found that an organic relationship obtains between Israel's designs to annex the occupied territories  on the one hand  and its violations of the Geneva Conventions  on the other; that the General Assembly has repeatedly condemned Israeli policies and practices; and that the Commission on Human Rights has declared at its latest session that ""grave breaches of the fourth Geneva Convention committed by Israel in the occupied Arab territories constitute war crimes and an affront to humanity"". 172.	The crisis in the Middle East is not confined to the situation created by the Israeli aggression of 1967 and the resultant occupation. This aspect of the problem is in fact a derivative; it is the result of the underlying  original problem  namely  the fate of the Palestinian people and its homeland. The General Assembly has in fact shown belated awareness of this obvious fact when it declared in resolutions adopted in 1970 and 1971 that there can be no durable and lasting peace in the Middle East unless the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the rights of return and self-determination  are fully respected and observed.173.	The costly and strenuous battle waged in recent years by the Palestinian people for the restoration of its rights constitutes its response  not only to the Zionist usurpation of its homeland and to the displacement and oppression it has suffered at the hands of Israel  but also to the complacency of the international community about Israel's persistent violation of Palestinian rights through usurpation  displacement and oppression. After some 20 years of patient and hopeful expectation  after waiting all that time for some action by the international community to live up to its pledges and to ensure the implementation of its resolutions  and after the frustration of all those hopes and expectations  a new generation of Palestinians has at last arisen to shoulder the burdens of its destiny and to wage its own battle for return  for liberation and for the restoration of its rights.174.	The world-which for. 20 years has abandoned the Palestinian people and left it at the mercy of those who have usurped its homeland  displaced it and deprived it of the opportunity to enjoy a life of dignity in its own country and which  contenting itself with reiterating its recognition of the right of return  has done absolutely nothing to make it possible for Palestinians to enjoy in fact the fulfillment of that cherished hope-cannot now absolve itself of its responsibility for the frustration experienced by the Palestinian people or for the desperation that it generates or the extremism to which it may lead.175.	The United Nations is indeed called upon to engage in earnest soul-searching and bold self-criticism  and to admit its share of responsibility both for the fate suffered by the Palestinian people and for such consequences as it has already begun to generate.176.	Israeli outcries have recently been heard about what Israeli propaganda chooses to call Palestinian terrorism. Clearly the objective is to divert attention from the terrorism perpetrated by Israel itself in and across the occupied territories. At the same time  Israel hopes that by misrepresenting the true nature of the Palestinian national liberation movement it may succeed in neutralizing some of the sympathy which that movement has elicited from all those who believe in the liberty of peoples and uphold their right to struggle for the restoration of their rights. Nor is it far-fetched to assume that one of the purposes of the current Israeli campaign is to provide in advance justification for some new expansionist venture in Arab territories long coveted but not yet conquered by Israel.177.	Whatever the aims of the Israeli campaign of vilification may be  the incontestable fact remains that Israel is not so much the victim as the author of terrorism in the Middle East. For it was by means of terrorism that Israel was established. It was by means of terrorism that Israel came to acquire the lands it now occupies and it now exploits. And it was by means of terrorism that Israel transformed an innocent people living peacefully in its own ancestral homeland into a people half of which is displaced and dispersed outside its homeland while the other half suffers deprivation and humiliation under Israeli rule or military occupation.178.	Nor was the terrorism through which Israel was founded transitory  or the product of passing circumstances or momentary impulses. Nor indeed was it the aberration of a small group of dissident extremists outside the Zionist mainstream. It was  on the contrary  a purposeful  planned and organized terrorism. It was an official terrorism  methodically practiced and carefully calculated in its timing  its methods  and its targets.179.	There is a vast difference between the two situations. In the one case a people struggles for the liberation of its land and the restoration of its rights; and deprivation and desperation drive a handful of its members to acts of terrorism against the usurpers of its land and rights. In the other case the Government of a Member of the United Nations has systematically practiced terrorism  not only since the birth of that State  but also long after its establishment and up to this very day.180.	In the period preceding the establishment of Israel the Zionist terrorist acts were attributed to  and admitted by  some organized groups  notably the Irgun and the Stern organizations  which pretended to constitute the opposition within the Zionist movement and posed as dissenters from the Zionist program of action. But documents released at that time by the Mandatory Government and the memories published later by the leaders of those organizations themselves authoritatively give the lie to those pretenses  and reveal irrefutably the full dimensions of the collusion and co-ordination which obtained between the so-called extremist organizations and the official agencies of Zionism in every terrorist act perpetrated by the former.181.	Indeed  no sooner was Israel established than the mask was lifted: the organizations formerly described as ""extremist"" were merged into the regular Israeli army and their leaders brought into the ruling establishment  some becoming members of parliament  others ministers  and others deputy prime ministers. Thus those who planned or executed the assassination of Lord Moyne  Count Bernadotte or Colonel Serot  the blowing-up of the King David Hotel over the heads of its residents or the massacre of Deir Yasin came to occupy high civilian and military positions in Israel. Overnight  professional terrorists were transformed into statesmen occupying key positions in a Government which readily embraced the practice of terrorism as though it were a legitimate instrument of national policy.182.	The bond which  before the establishment of Israel  had linked Zionism with terrorism was not severed after the rise of Israel and its admission to membership of the United Nations. All that happened in the new era was that Zionist terrorism underwent a metamorphosis  a change of form but not of substance.183.	It is true that in the first few years following the signing of the general armistice agreements the Israeli Government tried to continue the pretense of the pre-Israeli period  attributing the raids conducted by its regular armed forces across the armistice demarcation lines and the accompanying massacres to imaginary groups of irregulars as it did  for example  in the cases of Qibya and Nahhalin. But United Nations observers confirmed in every instance that it was the regular armed forces of Israel that made the raids and perpetrated the massacres.184.	Before long  Israel abandoned the pretense and took to open  unmasked terrorism. Beginning with the attack onGaza in 1955 and the massacres of Kafr Qasin and Khan Yunis in 1956  Israel unleashed a series of attacks which reached their climax on the eve of the aggression of 1967 in the Sammu'i raid.185.	The aggression of 1967 ushered in a new era  in which Israel's participation in official terrorism escalated. It involved its air force in terrorist actions  unleashing without restraint its airmen against civilian populations and civilian establishments to rain death upon laborers in Egyptian factories and children in Egyptian schools  and upon women and old men and children in the villages and towns of Jordan  Lebanon and Syria and the refugee camps in those countries.186.	Moreover  a new field for Israeli terrorism was opened up in that era. I refer now to the occupied territories. This Assembly has received official reports containing ample evidence of this category of Israeli terrorism: including torture under interrogation and torture in detention; detention of thousands without trial; arbitrary demolition of homes; expulsion of people from their homes  their villages and their country; imposition of collective punishment; detention of the families and kin of freedom-fighters as hostages in desert concentration camps; and similar arbitrary and inhuman practices.187.	Nor was Israel content with these varieties of terrorism. It has been committing actions which are normally the hallmark of gangs operating outside the pale oi xBW and order. Thus it has stooped to kidnapping civilian and military personnel from the territories of neighboring Arab States  refusing to release some of them despite urgent demands from the Security Council. It has taken into custody Arab passengers on international aircraft making unscheduled landings in Israel  holding them for long periods. And it has dispatched its saboteurs to civilian airports to destroy planes on the ground.188.	And now  after this long record of terrorism- organized  planned and purposeful terrorism—Israel raises its voice in righteous indignation against terrorism in an attempt to incite the world against the Palestinian people in its entirety  even though Palestinians are in truth the collective victims of Israel's own governmental terrorism.189.	Kuwait does not condone practices of terrorism  regardless of who is their perpetrator and who their victim. Kuwait regrets the shedding of innocent blood  whoever the victims may be  and grieves over the indiscriminate subjection of man  any man  to murder or agony or torture.190.	Having stated this  I must at the same time recall the fact that violence is alien to the character of the Palestinian people  whose history  both remote and recent  has manifested their humane virtues of tolerance  brotherhood "" hospitality and generosity. Even if we put aside the remote past in an effort to avoid marshaling masses of details  it is sufficient to recall the recent past. The scene is one of a peaceful people  which finds itself exposed to an invasion air tied at nothing less than its displacement from its ancestral homeland  rising heroically to repel that invasion  waging for decades a battle of self-defense  with honor and dignity  and resisting every temptation to engage in indiscriminate violence.191.	If frustration and desperation  caused by its abandonment by the international community  have prompted some of its members to counter official Israeli terrorism with individual acts of terror  it would be unfair to hold the patient and struggling Palestinian people as a whole accountable for those acts.192.	However  even if we were to assume for the sake of argument and I emphasize that it would be a completely false assumption that the whole Palestinian people had come to embrace terrorism as a program  we would nevertheless feel constrained to ask  is the international community entitled to expect those whom it has deprived of the protection of the law to abide by that law  or to expect those whom it has deprived of the blessings of public order to be concerned for the security of that order? Does the international community have the right to expect those to whom it has denied the opportunity to enjoy their inalienable  elementary rights to acknowledge obligations towards it? Does the United Nations have a right to expect from those with respect to whom it has betrayed the principles of its own Charter and whom it has relegated to a limbo outside the framework of the new world order which the United Nations was created in order to promote-does the United Nations have a right to expect from these people loyalty to that order?193.	It is anomalous that the tragedy suffered by the Palestinian people for a quarter of a century and directly affecting the life of every single Palestinian without exception should have no place on the agenda of the General Assembly while an item said to be inspired by certain actions performed by a few members of that people appears on the agenda. It is astonishing that the tragedy of the Palestinian people  to the creation and aggravation of which the United Nations has contributed  continues to be absent from the agenda of the General Assembly while some of the consequences of the desperation generated by that tragedy appear before it as an independent item.194.	Is this because some believe that terrorism when perpetrated by individuals is worthy of arousing the concern of the United Nations  whereas systematic terrorism perpetrated by the government of the United Nations is not worthy of arousing the concern of the Organization? Or is it perhaps because the fate of two and three-quarter million Palestinians  victims of Zionist-Israeli terrorism  is less important in the view of some than the fate of a few dozen Israelis? Or is the explanation for the anomaly to which I have just alluded to be found  alternatively  in the fact that there are some who are aware of the events of the moment  but who forget or ignore the background of those events  even though it is of continuing reality and relevance? Or are there among us some who fancy that results can be effectively dealt with even when no effort is made to deal correctively with the causes which produced them?195.	What the General Assembly is called upon to do  before proceeding to consider the question of contemporary terrorism  is to pause for some quiet reflection- bold  wise  judicious and impartial reflection. Bold reflection provides us all with the opportunity to exercise some badly-needed  harsh self-criticism  which alone can enable us to take congnizance of  and to correct  the mistakes  whether of omission or of commission  made by the international community. Wise reflection enables us to view the events of the moment within the context of  and not in isolation from  their causes. Judicious reflection would not permit the treatment of effects to divert attention from the treatment of their causes. And impartial reflection refuses to equate the aberrations of a handful of deprived and desperate individuals with the sins committed formally by the government of a Member of the United Nations in accordance with carefully laid-out plans.196.	Only after a pause such as this and through such reflection can the General Assembly  and through it the international community as a whole  be true to the premise on which the Charter rests that there can be no peace without justice and find the path to true and durable peace."
"66",3903,"LAO",27,1972,"His Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma  our First Minister  detained by his many obligations  having been unable to come this year to the rostrum to plead the cause of"" Laos as he has done each year  has entrusted to me the honor of representing him before this Assembly. Mr. President  allow me  on the occasion of your election  to extend the warm congratulations of Laos. In entrusting to you the burdensome task of presiding over its debates and of directing its proceedings  the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly wished to pay a tribute  first to your qualities as a diplomat  and  next  to your country  Poland  and to the courage of its people and to the realism of its leaders. My country has maintained cordial relations with your country since the Geneva Agreements of 1954  which judiciously appointed the International Supervisory Commission  of which Poland is one of the three members.2.	I should also like to pay a sincere tribute to your predecessor Mr. Adam Malik  who  in an atmosphere of unrest  presided over our debates at the twenty-sixth session with firm and tranquil authority. That distinguished statesman  who has worked so hard for the cause of peace and stability in South-east Asia  also succeeded in arousing general respect and admiration to the benefit of our Organization. He deserves our grateful thanks.3.	I should now like to turn to our new Secretary-General  to congratulate him on his tireless efforts over the past year to inculcate a universal awareness and a new public spirit  everywhere in the world  in order to rouse this Organization from its chronic passivity. With the admission of the People's Republic of China  our Organization has caught its breath and taken a major step towards the universality so much desired by all.4.	While concern and hope impel each of us to speak of peace in this Assembly  it is in fact violence which has predominated over the past year. In our Asia of monsoons  where we have had the dubious distinction of being the star  war has been raging for 10 years now  with ever- increasing violence  extending the conflict to the limits of IndoChina. In the Middle East where the state of ""no war  no peace"" persists  where the situation is blocked  the fever of adventurism is increasing the danger of a confrontation. Elsewhere  in Africa  a situation of veiled conflict  born of the aftermath of colonialism  is not about to improve. The world is tainted with violence. Like the revolutions of yesteryear  terrorism is now exported across frontiers. No continent has been spared its outbursts of anger  riots  repression  assassinations  killings  and so forth. There is no longer any haven of peace anywhere. A whole range of terrorist techniques  from aerial hijackings to attempted assassinations by remote control  or even through the post  has been developed and perfected  causing suffering and bloodshed to innumerable innocent victims. Obstinacy on the one hand  and hatred on the other  have created this kind of dialectic of despair which has impelled men to commit crimes of a new kind  far more dangerous because more insidious. Neither is there any assurance that these sacrifices  voluntary or involuntary  have done anything to bring about a real change in the balance of force or changed the real course of events.5.	As Buddhists  we strongly condemn these acts of terrorism regardless of their motives  because they lead directly to hatred  because they inject the virus of blind terror and  quite simply  because they lead to an erosion of international morality. But in the midst of these tempests  reefs and difficulties which rise in our path  visible signs of a rational order founded on a desire for peace and co-operation are beginning to appear.6.	Last year  our delegation declared that it approached the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly with a little more hope than in previous years. This feeling was based on specific observations. Since then bold  courageous and politically very wise initiatives have borne out our hopes. Truly  the world today has the clear impression that the winds of history are veering around since the great Powers  some of them once resolutely antagonistic  are finally agreeing on principles which could give them a breathing space. This process of active detente and ideological accommodation after the summit meetings at Peking and Moscow has given rise to tremendous hopes everywhere. The recent meeting between Prime Ministers Chou Enlai and Tanaka in Peking  the echo of which was heard across .the world  will certainly have beneficial effects in Asia.7.	We are thus far from the age when the great Powers were living virtually behind barricades  with weapons directed against potential aggressors  and the latter doing the same against their potential opponents.8.	The fine language of diplomacy was adorned with invective and sombre prophecies  although such prophecies were always given the lie by facts. The international climate was stifling and dangerous. Small nations looked with astonishment and anguish on the awesome eagerness of blocs and clans to predict the catastrophes which stalked this or that social system  to vaunt the merits of this or that system  as more and more fantastic weapons were constantly prepared for a decisive confrontation between good and evil. For years the concert of nations had become an appalling cacophony in which threats and condemnations predominated  as in certain ancient tragedies.9.	For some time now  it has seemed that we were moving towards a more humane and less adventurist view of politics. After all  what is at stake is war or peace. Although the security of States is the golden rule of diplomacy  it must not  however  be allowed to lead straight to total annihilation. Our delegation therefore welcomes the change in the international climate and the agreements  no matter how meager  which have been attained by way of corollary. The ancient demons are  of course  difficult to exorcise. We speak from sad experience  since our unhappy kingdom has been under unceasing attack for many years by a country which is 10 times stronger. Does the Assembly still recall our statements from this rostrum concerning this indescribable aggression? Do representatives know that the Ho Chi Minh trail passes through Laos and that it has become an open road to invasion and warfare? That is an important problem which  it has often been said  is not for the United Nations to solve  since the internal affairs of States are not within its competence.10.	We say that the war in Laos  the unhappy expression of the Indo-China war  is indeed an international matter. The two conferences held on this subject were international conferences. Legal subtitles can neither conceal nor distort what is the obvious truth. Thus it is futile to speak of peace and international solidarity when small nations which have no means to defend themselves are left to their fate amid widespread indifference. When there are thousands of dead  vast destruction  hundreds of thousands of people dis-placed must legalism be the ultima ratio in this Organization  which was established to defend and demonstrate peace? There has been  quite rightly  talk of a crisis of the Organization precisely because of its inability to solve international disputes.11.	This is what the problem is ail about. Our Prime Minister expressly wrote to the Secretary-General to this effect some time ago.  He said that in his honest opinion the Organization seemed to him the natural place for the settlement of disputes. As the Secretary-General has said  we should have a collective conscience. We believe that  when peace is threatened anywhere  all of us here should be concerned and should help in the quest for equitable solutions  and not simply endorse the fait accompli to turn questioningly towards this or that capital. In the case of Laos the origin of the trouble is clear: foreign troops have invaded our territory by entire divisions on a war footing accompanied by armored vehicles and modern artillery. Is this aggression or a military outing? Does war between North and South Viet-Nam authorize the belligerents to invade a sovereign neighboring country because it is strategically more convenient to pass through Laos than to cross the seventeenth parallel? A curious hypocrisy  of which I think no one in this Assembly is unaware: the guilty hand of Hanoi  which feigns to respect one frontier in order to violate another.12.	Thus  does the Messianic ideology of a country place it above international law? Does political testament of a national hero permit that country on the grounds of what it calls a sacred mission  no longer to recognize and respect any border? Why must the reunification of Viet-Nam be effected at the expense of other countries? Is North Viet-Nam being attacked and invaded by the forces of Laos  Cambodia or even Viet-Nam? Of course not.13.	My country asks you to give further thought to those questions. They are indeed within our jurisdiction. They are our moral responsibility  because by the very reason of our hesitation and caution those who have committed aggression against us have been able cynically to declare that we are serving the policy of the imperialists which in their eyes justifies their deploying their divisions  without admitting it  throughout Laos and mounting the attack of which we are today the victims. Thus it is that in IndoChina and elsewhere  little by little  the principles of the Charter and the principles of Bandung are eroded; thus it is that  little by little  small nations have the feeling that their protests and statements made before the United Nations have become a purely academic exercise and  being unable to obtain justice  they had better seek other means. Thus it is that the crisis of the Organization has continued over the years. It is a crisis of conscience  and only through a galvanizing of this collective conscience  which has failed us  can our institution truly be the monument of hope.14.	So far as our country is concerned  however  we still have hope  because it is precisely in South-East Asia  which is so threatened  that the peoples are beginning to be aware of their common destiny. Nothing that happens or may hap;  in the IndoChina peninsula can be a matter of indifference to the great masses of people who live close to these warm waters  which are sailed by so many vessels  some of which have been following the same routes for decades. We would even say that the political interest is not limited to those coasts alone. So that  if we want peace in so coveted a region  it must be established soon. Laos therefore welcomed with the greatest sympathy the efforts of Indonesia  Malaysia  Thailand  the Philippines and Singapore to try and find a solution to the IndoChina conflict. We have made known our feelings on this subject. A global solution must be found for all the nations concerned in the war  for there is a common IndoChinese front  which conceals and further burdens the Laotian problem by prolonging it. We also welcome with great pleasure the steps taken by the two Koreas to resolve the question of the unification of that country. Those are examples of great political wisdom by which many a belligerent should be guided. In the case of countries which were once united but which have become different States  we think that in the age in which we are living the identity of nations is such that territorial partition is an inhuman act of political surgery which can only feed rancor and hatred.15.	And if Laos is to serve as an example  at least for the peaceful settlement of the problems of IndoChina  my delegation will recall that we were among the first to opt for neutrality when the storm was breaking upon us. Neutrality does not mean isolation although we can speak with some bitterness of the state in which our country now finds itself because of the aggression of one of its neighbors and for the reasons mentioned at the beginning of this statement. Political alignment entails ties which cannot be supported by countries which  like ours  lack the means. With the Geneva agreement of 1962  we accepted political non-alignment. We have respected our signature  while others have held theirs at naught. But non-alignment cannot itself mean an option in which aggressors and aggressed against are mingled. If non-alignment is a philosophy for a policy of peace  it is necessary to distinguish between those who send their armies to invade other countries and those who respect international frontiers. Ideology is no excuse for doing everything in order to triumph. The export of ideas by force of arms: that quite simply is what we blame the imperialists for.16.	Peace requires the abandonment of unreasonable ambitions and respect for the ideas of others. If North Viet-Nam was not convinced that it was following the direction of history and that it must liberate all the neighboring peoples of old IndoChina and impose  with its friends  a regime which it regards as the best  the most just and the most humane  it would not have invaded our country. It must be recognized that millions of people are resisting because the attitudes of the North VietNamese have not won the unanimous support of the Laotian and Khmer peoples. North Viet-Nam is quite simply throwing down a challenge to the international community by carrying the war into Laos  allegedly to struggle against the imperialists  who have never entered the country  whereas the first North VietNamese battalions were already in place  having entered our national territory in strength. It is therefore certainly the intention to destroy our society  the monarchy and the institutions which we have established with the assistance of our people and in complete freedom. For two decades we have been denouncing this aggression  which is an insult to law and to international agreements. Our delegation can state that the Royal Government ofLaos has done everything in its power to settle its disputes with the Neo Lao Hak Xat  the political party created and maintained by the Hanoi Government. Recently  again  we accepted the five points of the Lactam Patriotic Front as a basis for discussion. We propose that the use of firearms should be immediately halted under strict and impartial international control. We have reason to believe that if the North VietNamese will ease their pressure and withdraw from our country  the Lao of all parties will soon settle their disputes. The latest messages exchanged between the two Princes seem to mark a step forward in the patient and continuous search for a dialog opening the way to the reconciliation and harmony desired by all.17.	The negotiations taking place between the principal interlocutors hold out prospects for peace which seem better now than they ever were in the past. May they lead to a global solution of all the IndoChinese problems  so that those peoples  decimated by interminable and now pointless struggles  may recover their identity in peace and reconciliation.18.	Our contribution to peace is  therefore  sincere  loyal and continuous. We have given specific and repeated proof of that. The Government of Hanoi alone has opposed it  through the Neo Lao Hak Xat  which is now prisoner of its political choice.19.	If there is any collective conscience in this Organization it must now awaken and become aware of Laotian realities. It is a matter of urgency that  as we said last year ""It is imperative for all international bodies which are mindful of the need for peaceful coexistence and for the signatories to the Geneva agreements  who are responsible for their application  to decide at last to assume their fundamental responsibility."" [1943rd meeting  para. 54.]20.	This year again we reiterate our wish and our appeal on behalf of the people of Laos  in the name of the sufferings they endure  in the name of the solidarity which here should unite us when one of us suffers injustice  when one of us sees with despair part of our people scattered and wandering  our towns destroyed  and murderous and arrogant foreign legions coming to lay down the law in an independent and sovereign country we reiterate our appeal for an end once and for all to the sad chapter of this long march in torment and in blood  so that we may at last together usher in the beginning of a new era of concord and peace."
"67",3950,"LBN",27,1972,"Mr. President  your election to the presidency of our General Assembly is for us a source of profound joy. The honor it bestows upon your friendly country and on your own person is a just tribute to your high personal qualities and your competence.6.	In associating the delegation of Lebanon with the warm congratulations and good wishes that have been addressed to you  I wish to assure you of our full co-operation and to express our conviction that under your wise guidance our work will progress under the very best of circumstances.7.	We are also pleased to thank and pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  and to recall the wisdom  tactfulness and great skill with which he discharged the functions of the presidency of the last General Assembly session  in particularly delicate circumstances.8.	The agenda of the present session includes many important items to the consideration of which the delegation of Lebanon will lend its full co-operation. I shall at this time limit myself to mentioning two of them which are  for us as a developing country  of particular interest. These are disarmament and development.9.	One of the priority aims of our Organization is to achieve disarmament. The mad arms race of recent years and the terrible holocaust that threatens our universe must urge States all States forward to work by every possible means for the attainment of that noble objective. We recognize  to be sure  that some progress has been made and that some partial success has been achieved within the framework of our Organization or bilaterally. But much more will have to be done and our efforts to achieve the goals we seek must be increased.10.	That is why the delegation of Lebanon welcomes the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference within the framework of the United Nations. This conference will be called upon to contribute to dispelling the fears of an anxious mankind  to carry out progressively and by stages the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the destruction of these weapons and  finally  to arrive at the desired disarmament to ensure international security.A/PV.204111.	Disarmament cannot be disassociated from.the major problem confronting our planet: that of development. It is not by mere chance that the General Assembly has proclaimed the 1970s as both a disarmament and development decade. Incalculable resources are swallowed up every year for military purposes. A minute part of these resources  if devoted to action for development  would greatly contribute to solving the economic and social problems which are becoming increasingly acute because of under-development  would narrow the gap between the rich and the poor of the earth and would lessen the enormous disparities which still exist within national communities as well as between a small group of privileged countries and the vast majority of mankind.12.	The International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)J  which was inspired by the loftiest principles  has set important targets and defined the means to attain them. However  these principles and objectives must not remain pious hopes; and a political will  particularly on the part of the developed countries  and a feeling of human solidarity over and above selfish interests must contribute to implementing these objectives fully.13.	The disappointing results of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  which confirmed the' apprehensions that the previous conference had aroused  prove that this will and this feeling have not yet attained the necessary degree and intensity.14.	On another level  we are gratified at the positive results achieved at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The Declaration of the Conference  the environment funds and the appropriate institutional machinery will doubtless promote international cooperation for the preservation of the human environment. In this field as in others relating to development  the contribution of the advanced countries is of paramount importance and the needs and interests of the developing countries must be protected. Lebanon for its part will contribute within its means to the collective undertaking for the preservation of the environment.15.	The yearly sessions of the General Assembly provide us with an opportunity to assess the international political situation and to measure the progress accomplished in the attainment of the objectives of our Charter. This year we find indications both of new hope and continuing disenchantment.16.	First of all  we see reason for hope because we have observed an atmosphere of detente and rapprochement which has continued to establish itself and develop throughout the past year and a slow but sure progress towards the peaceful political solution of a certain number of conflicts and crises which trouble our world.17.	The high-level contacts between the great Powers and the recourse to diplomacy and discussion certainly contribute to the maintenance of peace and encourage rapprochement and co-operation  thereby removing the specter of confrontation. The efforts made to accelerate the process of the political settlement of certain persistent conflicts also contribute to a relaxation of the international climate an.r to putting into effect within our Organization the principle of universality  which is so earnestly desired.18.	However  we cannot help noticing that there is less interest in certain grave problems  in particular  the situation prevailing in the Middle East  which constantly threatens international peace and security. The interdependence of nations in our present world is such that it is quite obvious that no nation can remain indifferent to the crises which for many years have troubled that part of the world.19.	I need not recall facts which are known to all. I simply wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to two points which  as I see it  are of particular interest.20.	The first is that the Assembly  as well as other United Nations organs  such as the Security Council and the Commission on Human Rights  has already adopted clear- cut positions on the question of the Middle East in general and on some of its aspects in particular  for example on the status of Jerusalem  the treatment of the occupied populations and the Israeli attacks against Lebanon and other Arab countries.21.	What I should like to say here and I shall never tire of repeating it-is that none of these decisions  and I stress ""none""  has been implemented by Israel.22.	Ambassador Jarring's mission under Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has been deliberately and methodically sabotaged  like the decision itself. General Assembly resolution 2799 (XXVI)  adopted at the last session  which  like Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  was designed to seek a political solution to the conflict  has not even begun to be implemented.23.	In resolution 2253 (ES-V)  which was adopted by an overwhelming majority on 4 July 1967 and confirmed by resolution 2254 (ES-V) of 14 July 1967  the General Assembly declared that the annexation of Jerusalem to the State of Israel was invalid and called on Israel ""to rescind all measures already taken and to desist forthwith from taking any action which would alter the. status of Jerusalem"". Other resolutions on the same lines have been adopted since 1967  confirming the above-mentioned resolutions. In spite of this  the process of Judaization is continuing implacably in the Holy City.24.	The populations of the occupied territories  which should have been protected by the Geneva Conventions and the general laws of war  are subjected by the occupier to a veritable regime of terror. Kept in a state of inferiority and subjection  their freedoms are violated and their property is plundered. The commissions of inquiry established by the United Nations have never been able to carry out the mission entrusted to them. The Israeli authorities have always refused them access to the territories which Israel controls.25.	Even within the territories that since 1948 have been directly subjected to Israeli authority  the Arab populations have always been the subject of bullying and discrimination. The treatment applied to them is the most arbitrary which can be imagined. By way of example  the Christian inhabitants of the villages of Kefar Bar'am and Iqrit  who were removed by force from their homes in 1948  have not been able to return to their villages and land in spite of a decree in their favor  a decree which this time was issued not by the Security Council but by the Supreme Court of Israel itself. What has happened at Iqrit and Kefar Bar'am is but an example. It illustrates the procedures used by the Israeli authorities in hundreds of similar cases.26.	In another field which is of more direct concern to my country  how many times has the Security Council condemned Israel for the attacks committed by its armed forces against Lebanon? How many times has it called upon Israel to put an end to its aggression and threatened it with more effective measures if it did not change its attitude?27.	All these appeals  resolutions and injunctions have remained without effect  as have those which defined the foundations for political solutions  those intended to safeguard the real character of Jerusalem and protect the populations in the occupied territories  or those designed to put an end to aggression against neighbors. These resolutions  to quote Israel  are ""destined for the morgue of history"".28.	No further proof is needed e Israel does not intend to submit to any discipline or to implement any decision. Only the policy of force counts for Israel.29.	I consider that this permanent challenge to the international community by a country which owes every- thing-even its very existence to the United Nations quite obviously raises a problem which should be considered and settled by the United Nations. The facts of the problem are clear  as I have just recalled. What is also clear are the elements of the solution. By this I mean the sanctions provided in Chapter VII of the Charter of our Organization.30.	The second point to which I should like to draw the attention of this Assembly is that the conflict in the Middle East is degenerating rapidly and becoming extremely dangerous. Acts of violence have become so frequent  so broad and so serious that they no longer threaten only the civilian populations  but even endanger international peace and security. Certain Palestinian elements on the one hand  and the regular Israeli forces on the other hand  are embarked on an infernal cycle of violence.31.	If measures were to be adopted to put an end to this state of affairs  it seems to us necessary  if they are to be effective  that they should be studied in an impartial spirit inspired by the two following requirements.32.	First of all  the study must cover all the acts of violence. To circumscribe it to the acts committed by the Palestinians alone would be proof of partiality and injustice. One must not pretend to forget that it is the Zionists who inaugurated political terrorism and introduced it in the Near East. Today there is too great a tendency to wish to ignore the bloody exploits of the Haganah  Irgun  Stern and many other Zionist terrorist organizations. But how can one fail to remind all those who no doubt in order to clear their consciences are accusing the Palestinians of the assassination of Count Bernadotte  the United Nations mediator  or of the massacre of the inhabitants in the village of Deir Yassin  where the bodies of old people  women and children were thrown into a hole where they were discovered by the International Red Cross? How can we forget the attack on the King David Hotel in Jerusalem which killed men  women and children?33.	Without going too far into the past  which is nevertheless still in our minds  let us recall to those who today show so much anger and indignation about the taking of hostages and the massacre which followed -a massacre which took place under very confused circumstances that no one seems to be in a hurry to elucidate- that however horriMe the violence which took place in Munich  the attack committed only yesterday by the Israeli forces within the territory of Lebanon was no less odious and condemnable.34.	On 21 June 1972 Israeli forces penetrated into our territory  killing 3 Lebanese soldiers and kidnapping 6 Lebanese and Syrian officers to be used as hostages in order to obtain the liberation of Israeli prisoners held in Egypt and Syria. Those who committed this aggression were not uncontrolled and practically uncontrollable elements; they were not men who were driven to despair and who are alone responsible for their acts. They were soldiers of a regular army  acting on behalf of their Government and on the orders of their superiors. This act of State terrorism was applauded by the Israeli leaders and presented by them as a glorious exploit.35.	On the morrow of the Lod attack  of which Lebanon immediately disapproved and with which it was in no way associated  the Israeli air force on 21  22 and 23 June unleashed an attack against the innocent civilian population of Hasbaya and Deir El-Achaer  killing and wounding men  women and children. The intention of Israel was to take revenge on the peaceful Lebanese villagers for the Puerto Rican and Israeli deaths which had taken place under the guns of foreign extremists who came to Israel from a foreign country. How can one fail to condemn this massacre of Lebanese civilians  dictated by an apparent logic of terror?36.	Only a few days ago  on 8 September  the same Israeli air force bombed three sites in the north and south of Lebanon. The ""glorious"" results of this heroic operation was that 9 children  one woman and 2 men were killed and 34 other civilians were wounded  including 16 children aged from 8 to 15 years.37.	Even more recently  on 16 September an armored Israeli division  with air support  invaded the south of Lebanon under cover of ""suppressing"" the fedayeen. Actually  it destroyed or damaged 435 dwellings and two bridges  killed or wounded 143 military and civilian Lebanese  as well as approximately a score of Palestinian refugees  and itself suffered severe losses inflicted by the Lebanese army. I believe that the least that can be said about this typical new aggression is that it had resulted in a definite setback for Israel on the political level and on the military level.38.	Is it the desire to take measures against terrorism? Such measures can be effective only if they are based on objectivity  not using two weights and two measures.39.	Secondly  if there is really a desire to do away with acts of violence  one must attack honestly and courageously the real causes and discover means of eradicating them. It is not sufficient to consider certain episodic manifestations. In this connexion  certain truths should be said  and said without hedging the issue  even though they might disturb the moral and intellectual comfort of those people and circles who are complacently desirous of keeping a clear conscience and who themselves shoulder an awesome responsibility  either because they have persecuted the Jews  or because they have allowed the Jews to subject an innocent people to the atrocious treatment to which they themselves were subjected.40.	The creation of the State of Israel was accompanied by the mass exodus of the inhabitants of Palestine  provoked by threats  intimidation and terror. Today there is a new Diaspora of wandering Palestinians and displaced Arabs  who cannot and do not want to be assimilated in any other country.41.	These people  almost 2 million human beings  live in a state of growing despair  which explains certain passionate reactions and certain desperate acts. These people are convinced  quite rightly  that they are the victims of Zionist terror.42.	Despite all the principles on which our civilization is based  never has this people been given the opportunity to be consulted as to its fate or to exercise its natural right to self-determination. True  the international community had decided 23 years ago that the Palestinians who were chased away could choose between returning to their homes or receiving just compensation [resolution 302 (IV)]. But for 23 years never has there been a beginning of the application of this decision because of the intransigence of Israel. Nor has the international community  in 23 years  ever decided to apply the decision which it itself had freely adopted. The Palestinians-and who can blame them? -feel themselves to be totally abandoned and betrayed.43.	If it is really desired to do away with the sources of violence  it is to this source that one must go in the first place. It will solve nothing to repress  it will avail nothing to punish  one group of persons or another or any given country which one considers -unjustly  furthermore- to be responsible for any given attempt. Violence has never suppressed violence. On the contrary  it rekindles and exacerbates it and gives it increased vigor  audacity and intensity.44.	What does one expect  what can one expect from repression- that it will physically repress the elements of the Palestinian resistance? Suppose that this objective could be attained and that the world were to tolerate such genocide. Can one not foresee that the resistance of the Palestinian people will rise from the ashes and give it a vigor and aggressiveness which it has never known so far?45.	Zionist terrorism cannot suppress the entire Palestinian people. And as long as justice is not done and these legitimate aspirations are not satisfied  one must expect these feelings of despair and frustration to increase in intensity and seriousness.46.	Before I conclude  it is my duty to draw the attention of the Assembly most particularly to the aggressive attitude of Israel in regard to my country. Israel has constantly been committing aggression against Lebanon for four years  whereas the Armistice Agreement of 1949  which remains in force and was once again confirmed by the Security Council in its consensus of 19 April 1972   categorically forbids Israel to do so. Israel first sought to justify these aggressions by alleging that there had been rocket fire from Lebanese territory directed against the territories under Israel's control.47.	Lebanon adopted certain measures to put an end to these allegations. Being short of arguments  Israel then claimed that Palestinian resistance fighters were undertaking acts of violence within the occupied territories and it deduced from this that they had infiltrated through the Lebanese frontier  Lebanon then requested of the Security Council  and obtained on 19 April 1972  an increase in the number of observers on its international frontier. The reports of these international observers presented to the Council prove not only that the allegations of Israel are unfounded  but further  that it is Israel itself which constantly violates the Lebanese frontier.48.	At the end of 1968  the Israeli commandos destroyed 13 Lebanese civil aircraft at the airport in Beirut  under the pretext that Palestinian commandos which had attacked an Israeli aircraft at Athens had passed through Lebanon in transit. Even more recently  after the Lod attack  the Israeli army organized a genuine massacre of the Lebanese civilian population under the pretext that the extremists had passed through Lebanon in transit. On the morrow of Munich three deadly raids were carried out against the Lebanese civilian population  and this time Israel felt no need to seek the slightest justification.49.	Need I say how fallacious these pretexts seem to us? That there are Palestinians in Lebanon and that they feel that they are the victims of Israel nobody denies; Israel knows it better than anyone  since it has forced them by terror to take refuge in Lebanon and is against their repatriation.50.	Moreover  Palestinians are settled in a large number of countries  Arab and non-Arab. If Israel were to follow all their movements  suspect and implicate all the countries where they reside or through which they may have gone in transit  then it would be not only towards Lebanon but towards most of the countries of the world that it should launch its bomber squadrons.51.	How can one allow Israel to attack Lebanon  and Lebanon alone  persistently  whenever any action is undertaken against its interest or its nationals in any part of the world? If the intransigence of the leaders of Israel was the cause of the Munich massacre  by what confused logic can one blame Lebanon and hence justify the attacks on Lebanon and the massacre of women and children? Furthermore  the Federal Government of Germany itself officially declared that Lebanon could not in any way be held responsible.52.	Actually Israel is pursuing quite different objectives. If Lebanon is the target it is not to avenge Athens  nor Lod  nor Munich. I repeat  Lebanon-and Israel knows it -is in no way implicated in these affairs. What Israel is doing is seeking a pretext to destroy it. Lebanon in its present structure  where Jews  Christians and Moslems coexist freely  harmoniously and democratically  this Lebanon disturbs Israel because it is a categorical and living denial of Israel's racist concepts and policy of ostracism. Furthermore  Israel covets a part of our territory. It is an expansionist State by nature and by vocation and cannot be satisfied with fixed  immovable and recognized frontiers.53.	All the maps drawn up by the Zionist movement and the statements made by authoritative Israeli leaders confirm these objectives. Zionist propaganda  which has available to it means heretofore unknown in the history of the world  has succeeded in making international public opinion believe in the image of a peaceful and threatened Israel. The facts  particularly since 1967  categorically refute these assertions.54.	Today  when the same propaganda claims that the security of Israel is threatened by Lebanon  and that to defend its security it is forced to carry out military actions against Lebanon  no one can any longer believe it.55.	Lebanon does not threaten Israel. It is Israel which threatens Israel. It threatens Lebanon in its harmonious  human structures; in its integrity and its independence.56= The international community  which has so often condemned Israel for its aggression against my country  knows this full well. In expressing my gratitude  as well as that of Lebanon  to this community  and especially to those friendly countries that have so often taken the initiative of giving support to the cause of Lebanon  in particular by demanding the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory  I appeal once again to the friendship and vigilance of those I have mentioned to prevent any new aggression.57. It is not the Israelis or the Palestinians or the allies of either of the parties directly engaged in the conflict that can put an end to that conflict and thereby to acts of violence. It is only the international community which is capable of taking that responsibility. For my part  I refuse to make a definite finding of failure or bankruptcy. The founders of our Organization wished it to be powerful  effective  and capable of ensuring the new international order to which mankind aspired after the ravages of the war-a new order based on law and justice  solidarity  peace and collective security. Towards that end they vested the Security Council -which bears the prime responsibility for the. task of maintaining that new. international order-with powerful means. The Charter also provides for adequate measures to deal with the persistent violation of its principles by a Member of the Organization.58.	We are increasingly convinced that it is necessary and urgent to restore the authority of the United Nations and its prestige  to enable our Organization  by the energetic application of the provisions of the Charter  fully to ensure its noble role in the interests of all Member States  all nations  large or small.59.	Lebanon is a small country  which believes in peace and justice. It firmly believes in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations  and finds in the respect of these principles and their development the principal guarantee for its security. Accordingly  Lebanon would fervently hope that the safeguarding and consolidation of the United Nations will unite the faith and the energies of all States and of all men."
"68",3993,"LBR",27,1972,"It is for me a great pleasure to take my place for the first time on this rostrum  in the company of the brilliant galaxy of representatives who have already spoken and who are yet to speak  to address this august Assembly under the presidency of so astute a scholar and statesman as Mr. Stanisfaw Trepczyriski. My first duty  therefore  is to extend to you  Mr. President  my heartiest congratulations and those of my delegation on the unanimity and confidence with which members singled you out from among your eminent colleagues to preside over the proceedings of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.89.	Our deep admiration for you as a public figure and a statesman assures us that this session under your guidance will move nations from narrow national conceptions towards planetary conceptions of freedom and justice for all mankind and of sovereign equality for all States. We assure you that your success and the achievements of this session of the General Assembly are anticipated with a maximum of pride and faith.90.	Permit me now  Mr. President  to pay a well-deserved tribute to your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  who presided over the work of the twenty-sixth session of this Assembly with political and erudite diplomatic leadership. His voice and effective gavel will long be remembered by all who sat here.91.	All of us entertain an abiding appreciation of the dedication and sacrifices which U Thant as Secretary- General gave this Organization. He was an international civil servant of great stature and an effective spokesman who concentrated on measures that added significant dimensions of experience to the social welfare and the development aspirations of the developing nations  It is therefore not his fault that so many of the hopes and dreams of our generation remain unfulfilled.92.	But we are indeed happy that U Thant has been succeeded by a man whose bold initiatives  strength of character  depth of dedication and breadth of understanding give hope for the future of our Organization. Mr. Kurt Waldheim  as Secretary-General  has addressed himself to the problems and the weaknesses of our Organization with a frankness rare in politics. We fervently pray that he will command the co-operation and the support of all Members  in particular the great Powers  to the end that the conditions of the peoples of the world may be improved  peace and security may be realized and maintained  and faith in the United Nations may be restored.93.	The mission of this Organization is to serve a troubled world in the pursuit of peace and social justice. It is to provide a focal point for efforts to settle the disputes  moderate the attitudes  solve the problems and eliminate the injustices which engender war and promote fear and insecurity. As we enter upon the deliberations of this session of the Assembly  there are encouraging signs that international relations are moving towards conciliation and co-operation  notwithstanding the erstwhile stubborn confrontations and conflicts of the cold war. My delegation is convinced that if this trend is continued mankind can expect the attainment of a world in which real peace can be secured and maintained  social justice can be established  better living standards can be assured and fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person can be reaffirmed.94.	Yet the optimism inspired by recent developments is dampened by the increasing complexity of problems that have proven elusive of solution. Some of these problems are perennial agenda items of this Assembly; some the Assembly dare not place on the agenda  but their pertinence and a discussion of them cannot escape us.95.	If we look back  it can be said that the Organization has a number of accomplishments to its credit in an imperfect world.96.	Firstly  the process of decolonization was accelerated under the auspices of the United Nations. The existence of the United Nations gave anti-colonial forces a formidable institution through which world public opinion was brought to bear. No longer could the colonial Powers rule other peoples with virtually unlimited latitude as they did before the inception of the Organization. Sacred cows and hallowed pastures ceased to exist; no colonial Power could escape the scrutiny and criticism of the world community in respect of its colonial Territory; the level of brashness and condescension with which most colonial peoples were ruled was reduced  and virtually all the colonial Powers became more responsive to the demands of colonial peoples under their rule.97.	Secondly  the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  though far from perfect  have reduced considerably the danger of confrontation between the superPowers. The Middle East conflict  the Congo crisis  the war over Kashmir and the problems in Cyprus readily come to mind as examples of the effectiveness of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.98.	Thirdly  the United Nations and its specialized agencies have contributed and continue to contribute to the development efforts of the developing countries in various spheres of endeavor  with a view to making the society of man much more wholesome and functional.99.	Fourthly  the United Nations has served as a very useful forum for the discussion of international differences  giving the opposing sides an opportunity to retreat from previously held positions without loss of face.100.	Fifthly  and particularly within recent months  a few of the divisive gaps have been bridged and there seems to be a conscientious effort on the part of the big Powers to dismantle some of the ideological  ethnic and other barriers which have divided them. An era of negotiation  dialog and contact has emerged  and the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been convened at a time of great significance in the world outlook.101.	The Soviet Union and the United States have achieved some form of understanding toward trade and cultural agreement; the United States and the People's Republic of China  after 25 years of isolation  arc razing the barriers of division; the membership of the European Economic Community is expanding; a Convention on biological weapons control  has been signed; a Treaty banning weapons of mass destruction from the sea-bed and the ocean floor  has been promulgated; a Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] has been signed; the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks continue; and co-operation in many other areas is being developed.102.	We can say  then  that the accomplishments of the United Nations  limited though they may be attest to the fact that man has the potential to attain a wholesome functioning world community. Because of those accomplishments and developments  and because my country believes that man possesses great potential for good  the liberian delegation calls upon this session of the General Assembly to take a new look at the world situation  to seize the opportunity for achieving a more viable and cohesive world order and to take concrete and meaningful measures towards the realization of the objectives of the United Nations Charter.103.	The world is at present faced with a number of pressing issues that require urgent attention.104.	The developing countries are continuing to experience a deterioration in the terms of trade  with world prices for their primary commodities falling steadily while those of the manufactured goods they import  including essential capital and consumer goods  are constantly rising. By paying more and more for imports from the developed countries and obtaining less and less for their primary exports  the developing countries are placed in a position where they are unable to cope adequately with such essential problems as malnutrition  poverty  hunger  disease  ignorance  family planning and pollution  which inescapably and adversely affect the wholesome functioning of the society of man.105.	This is an international problem  and like all other international problems it requires an international solution. While it is agreed that self-help is the key to progress  the developing countries cannot ""go it alone"". They need substantial and meaningful assistance from the developed countries which would serve further to stimulate sustained growth and development.106.	If we are to avoid a confrontation between the rich and the poor countries  a confrontation that might even dwarf the erstwhile confrontation between the superPowers  then the international community will have to make every effort to narrow the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots""  for hunger  poverty  disease and ignorance provide fertile soil for the seeds of violent revolution  challenging and possibly destroying the very foundations of organized society107.	It is clear that this august body must act with urgency to improve the economic condition of the developing countries. This requires nothing less than a complete re-examination of the existing economic policies of the developed countries as regards trade  foreign aid and development. Empty pronouncements and token gestures will no longer suffice.108.	The international community must come to grips with the problems of racism in Africa. Of all the social ills in the world today  this is the most pernicious to the society of man. An individual who finds himself at the bottom of a social ladder can with some assistance work his way up. If he is experiencing difficulties because of his political views he can change those views  or pretend to change them  and return to the fold. But when a man is discriminated against because of his race-and blacks are proud of their race and make no apologies here for it he is being victimized for something he is not in a position to change. This victimization  when combined with racial pride  generates hatred  frustration  and  in some instances  aggression. It might be useful to add  in this context  that racial antagonism and actual warfare have a similar effect on the world community: they destroy the basis for co-operation and mutual understanding among members of the human race.109.	For our part  we believe racial discrimination should be condemned wherever it is practiced  be it on the continent of Africa  in North America  in Australia or anywhere else on the globe. Certainly  such a die-hard attitude has no place in twentieth-century thinking.110.	In this connexion  the principal trading partners of South Africa have a special responsibility to the world community because it is they who give support and succor to the racist regime of that country. If Vorster and his henchmen did not rely on the support of certain Powers which seem to place a higher premium on short-term profits than on human dignity  South Africa would never have defied the United Nations for so long with such impunity.111.	It matters not whether the level of trade which a particular country carries on with the racist regime is small in comparison with total international trade. It is immaterial what circumstances gave rise to the country's trade with  and investment in  South Africa. Nor is it relevant that trade is limited to a particular scarce commodity such as chrome  or that the countries involved are loud and persistent in their protestations of interest in Africa and friendship for the nations and peoples of the continent. The fact of the matter is that the United Nations has called on all its Members to exercise effective economic and related sanctions against the illegal regime. The peoples and countries of Africa also have called upon their good friends and well-wishers everywhere to support the cause for which they are striving and  accordingly  the decisions and resolutions of this Organization. We have no alternative  then  but to decry and to condemn all those who trade with the racist regime  even though they may be our professed friends.112.	Connected with the problem of racism in Africa is that of colonialism and minority domination on the continent. Here again  those countries that place a higher premium on trade with Portugal  South Africa and the rebel regime of Rhodesia than on freedom and justice cannot escape responsibility for the continued existence of this problem in Africa.113.	Liberia has contributed and will continue to contribute to the limits of its capability towards the total liberation of Africa from the shackles of colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism. We are determined to support our oppressed brothers in southern Africa and Guinea (Bissau) until total victory is achieved. There can be no compromise in this area.114.	We are committed to majority rule in Rhodesia  Angola  Namibia  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau)  and we believe that the future realization of freedom in those areas depends upon the preparedness of the United Nations to take those measures that will ensure the exercise of the right of self-determination and the right to independence of the peoples living under colonial oppression and discrimination. However  should the United Nations renegue in its obligation and commitment  then no choice is left to people who are denied equal rights and are suffering under the yoke of colonialism but to liberate themselves from that blight by resort to force. We therefore call upon ail freedom-loving peoples to lend their moral and material assistance to the freedom-fighters in Africa in an effort to rid their respective fatherlands of the shackles of colonial domination and oppression.115.	The problems of pollution must be solved if man is to succeed in preventing this planet from becoming uninhabitable.116.	Current trends suggest that it may well take the collective menaces and mass consequences arising from the world's scientific and technological strides to bind together all nations  enhance peaceful co-operation and surmount  in the face of physical danger  the political obstacles to mankind's unity. In the face of this pending reality man must accept that the earth he inhabits is his home  and consequently its surroundings must be made clear and kept wholesome.117.	Current efforts by the international community to encourage and assist action by governments and international organizations designed to protect and improve the human environment and to remedy and prevent its impairment  continue to have full endorsement and full support.118.	The international campaign of action to protect and improve the human environment must include  as a matter of necessity and priority  particularly in developing countries  specific national programs designed to enable the developing countries to forestall the occurrence of such problems of unfavorable and  at times  dangerous conditions of the environment as those experienced in developed countries because of their programs of mass scientific and technological explosions.119.	The plan of work for international action to protect man's habitat on earth approved by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm last June   in which my country fully participated  has taken into account some of our own fears on how to combat this new chapter of a major human problem  caused by the application by man of his knowledge of science and technology in disregard for his environment.120.	Population control  clean air and water  the conservation of natural and other resources  regulated growth rate  restrained technological ingenuity and disarmament are some of the means whereby man might be able to undo his worst handiwork not only for the sake of survival  but also to optimize the quality of life throughout the entire human environment. The one object of all of this must be to raise the level of human existence from mere survival to fulfillment.121.	We share also the sentiment of those who say that the timing of establishing an international plan and machinery to safeguard the human environment constitutes an achievement by itself. In the implementation of the plan  much is expected from those States that have achieved vast results in the application of science and technology. The assistance and guidance they will give to this endeavor will define in the future the limit of progress to be achieved.122.	However  if we should hold the developed countries to a higher degree of responsibility and  at the same time  require of them guidance and assistance  it should be equally binding on the developing countries to submit to the appropriate authority of the United Nations a full description of their national programs of action  including legislation  to protect the human environment and to submit annual reports on the implementation of those programs. And incidentally  as was just said by the illustrious speaker from India who preceded me  let us not use the excuse of the human environment and the avoidance of pollution in order not to give support to developing countries.123.	The kidnapping of diplomatic representatives and foreign nationals and the threat posed to international civil aviation by hijacking  sabotage and other criminal acts are of concern to the Government and people of Liberia. Of equal concern are the acts of terrorism perpetrated against innocent civilians  far removed from  and in no way involved with  the problems which allegedly gave rise to such acts.124.	No one can deny that those who are engaged in the struggle for freedom and justice are striving for a noble cause. However  there is a difference between those against whom a war of liberation is being waged and those who are not involved.125.	The Liberian delegation  accordingly  calls upon all nations to ratify existing conventions designed to prevent crimes against civil aviation  to take appropriate steps to ensure that those found guilty of such offenses are severely punished  to take measures for effective sanctions against countries which harbor or make martyrs of such persons  and to give due consideration to the objectives and purposes of the draft convention submitted at this session of the United Nations General Assembly to deal with and control acts of terrorism [A/C. 6jL. 850].126.	The Middle East problem must be solved so that the peoples in that troubled area of the world can live in peace and harmony  and not in conflict and discord. As a peace-loving State  maintaining friendly ties with the parties to the conflict  Liberia is deeply concerned that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has not yet been implemented. We therefore call on all parties to implement that resolution and to give their full support and co-operation to the Jarring mission so that negotiations may be undertaken at an early date by the parties directly concerned.127.	In harmony with a basic objective of the United Nations  we must find new approaches to save mankind from the scourge of war. Apart from the points which I have already enumerated and which are  in the view of my delegation  constructive approaches to a meaningful world peace  Liberia supports the call for a world disarmament conference. The objective of the conference should be to adopt realistic and effective measures aimed at eliminating all types of nuclear weapons and achieving general and complete disarmament under effective international control. It is in the interest of mankind that the spiraling arms race should be brought to an immediate halt. A number of achievements in the field of disarmament were witnessed in the decade of the 1960s  thus providing proof that progress in the elimination of nuclear weapons and towards general and complete disarmament is within the grasp of the international community.128.	It is the view of the Government of Liberia that  in pursuance of this effort to update procedures and the machinery dealing with the question of disarmament  a world disarmament conference should be established as an important body of the United Nations.129.	Wars are caused by men  but more particularly they are caused by men who are national leaders. If  then  wars are to be prevented and if mankind is to be freed for all time from that scourge  then men must be stopped from starting wars of aggression. My delegation is convinced that unless and until the international community can study the human factors which precipitate wars  and can find an effective means-whether by sanctions  ostracism or otherwise to prevent men and leaders from starting wars  the problem will persist. After all  wars solve no problems; they only create new ones.130.	The Declaration of the Rights of the Child was unanimously adopted by the United Nations in 1959 [resolution 1386 (XIV)]. The Liberian Government must lay stress on principles 2 and 7  regarding the best interest of the child  and principle 6  which stipulates that the child ""shall  wherever possible  grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents  and  in any case  in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security"". In the world today  the cruel act of war has deprived millions of children of these basic principles. Further  at the fifty-second session of the Economic and Social Council  the Council considered  among other things  within the framework of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on Human Rights  questions concerning the protection of women and children in times of emergency and armed conflict and the status of the unmarried mother  particularly with regard to children born out of wedlock. Adoption represents one of the most satisfactory answers to the type of problems just indicated.131.	Socio-economic conditions throughout the world are changing rapidly  and all governments should be aware of the effects of these socio-economic conditions on population trends. The Liberian Government has a special interest in the population problems of the world  especially the developing world  and sees a clear link with some of its own demographic problems; furthermore  it has always supported efforts aimed at the settlement of problems that affect mankind as a whole. Liberia thus took the initiative to request the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly of the new item entitled ""United Nations conference for a world convention on adoption law"" [A/8751]. We crave the due and timely consideration and support of Members of this new item during this session and full participation at the conference if and when it is convened.132.	Finally  the Charter of the United Nations opens with the stirring words: ""We the peoples"". These words  in my opinion  indicate the intention of the founders of the United Nations that all the peoples of the world should be deeply and totally involved in the achievement of its basic objectives. It is my delegation's firm opinion  and I am convinced  that unless and until we strive to have all the people of the world involved in the activities and programs and in the realization of the objectives for which the United Nations was founded this basic hope and objective will never be achieved. But how can this involvement be realized? I suggest that there are  among other means  at least two ways to achieve this objective. The first is to ensure that at the earliest possible moment all the nations and all the peoples of the world are represented in the United Nations. It is true that the Charter has laid down basic requirements for membership in the Organization  but it seems that political and diplomatic machinations have for many years kept a large segment of the world's population out of the Organization. Even today  although a nation has met all the basic requirements spelled out in the Charter for admission to this world Organization  its admission can be effectively prevented. If the words ""We the peoples"" are to be given substance in reality  then the political machinations by which nations and peoples are excluded from the Organization must be brought to a dramatic halt. We believe that the effectiveness of the Organization can be assured only when all the people of the world and all the nations of the world are effectively within the fold of this international  planetary organization. -133.	However  there is another context in which I believe the peoples of the world should become totally involved in the Organization; and that is through their personal  financial support of its existence and effectiveness.134.	One of the most serious problems that threaten the very survival of the Organization is a financial one. All of us know that the arrears reflected in the Organization's books have continued to mount steadily for a number of years. All of us are aware that in times of crisis the Secretary-General is hamstrung. He cannot take injnediate and effective measures to cope with such problems and crises  because funds are not available to him for such purposes. We are also painfully aware that this great world Organization is suffering from a fiscal and budgetary deficit of a few million dollars  with no clear indication of how this embarrassing deficit will be met. The situation has reached proportions where we believe strenuous and immediate measures are needed to rescue the Organization from this financial crisis and to strengthen the hands of the Secretary-General in cases of emergency.135.	In the light of the foregoing  my Government believes that positive action should be taken immediately to improve the worsening financial condition of the Organization. My delegation  accordingly  proposes that the United Nations should undertake a world-wide appeal to all the people of the world: to every boy and girl  every man and woman  every foundation  every business and every organization  to make financial contributions  in any amount  to a special United Nations fund  which might be known and referred to as ""The Secretary-General's Special Fund"" or by any other appropriate nomenclature. Such an appeal would involve all the people of the world in the Organization. It would be truly ""We the peoples"". The fund itself would provide liquidity to the Organization; it would enable prompt and effective action to be taken by the Secretary-General in cases of emergency wherever they may occur; it would contribute to the establishment of additional disaster preparedness centres at strategic points throughout the world; and it would enable the Secretary- General of the United Nations to act speedily and effectively when the need arises  to take such initiatives as particular circumstances may warrant  and to lose no opportunity that may present itself to him  for achieving the aims and objectives of the Organization.136.	There are three particular thrusts to this proposal: firstly  the involvement of all the peoples of the world in the Organization; secondly  the achievement and maintenance of the liquidity of the Organization; and  thirdly  the strengthening of the hand of the Secretary-General for effective action at all times. It is my understanding that the people of the world number about 4 billion. If that is correct and if the Members of the United Nations and the whole world give such an appeal their full moral support and an average contribution of  say  10 cents from each person in the world were achieved  as it might be if the appeal were well planned and a campaign for it properly organized  I daresay that within a few years the Secretary- General's hand would be strengthened by an amount of about $400 million.137.	My delegation urges that due consideration should be given this proposal and  if it seems appropriate  that the Secretary-General should be called upon to study the proposal in greater detail and to make recommendations for its early implementation.138.	As I come to the end of this statement  I should like to take cognizance of the fact that this Assembly represents the might and power of the world as well as its weaknesses and deficiencies. It embraces units of varying strengths and levels of development  of divergent views and interests  and of diverse problems and conditions. However  in spite of these varied conditions and notwithstanding these impediments  this Organization provides the most practical framework for all of us to work together to achieve peace  the paramount objective for which this Organization was founded. It is our view that  if our civilization is to survive  and if man is not to be reduced from his proud status as cultural man to that of a mere biological animal  we must  in the words of the Charter  endeavor ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors"".139.	Let us  therefore  subordinate our differences to the higher values of peace; let us emphasize our strengths as an Organization; and. let us learn to work and live together. We have no other choice."
"69",4039,"LBY",27,1972,"Mr. President  allow me first to extend to you my heartiest congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic on your accession to your high office as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This honor to you and your great country is a recognition of the long years of struggle against nazism and racism and is a further expression of the role your country and people have played in the affairs of mankind.167.	Allow me  Mr. President  to express our deep appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Malik  for guiding success-fully and with distinction the affairs of the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly. The peoples of Asia are proud that its great men have repeatedly contributed to the service of the peoples of the United Nations.168.	I should like also to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  who is participating in our meeting in his present capacity for the first time. The office of Secretary-General has always been an example to be followed in impartiality and neutrality and in the devotion of man to the affairs of his fellow men.165. More than a quarter of a century has passed since the adoption of the United Nations Charter. A quick comparison of the hopes and aspirations it contains with the present world situation clearly indicates the vast differences between the beauty of dreams and the pain and bitterness of realities. The Charter states: ""We the peoples of the United Nations""  while the world of today declares: ""We the States of the United Nations"". The world of today is governed by ""We the States of the United Nations"" where maneuvers  compromises and pressures find an open avenue for the achievement of purely selfish gains  never in the interest of the peoples of the United Nations. Those who were responsible for the formulation of the Charter committed themselves ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold suffering to mankind"". Yet some of the States have more than once  and at times under the flag of the United Nations itself  inflicted on the present and consequently future generations the scourges of war  racism and suppression. The result of this policy has been a perpetual state of sorrow and grief. Not only have innocent lives been lost and fundamental freedoms jeopardized  but also the prestige of the United Nations has been tarnished and the fundamental moral values embodied in its Charter negated.170.	The world of today leads us to believe that the expectations of those who formulated the Charter were neither realistic nor based on a true vision of the future of man for they envisioned a human society in which tolerance would be practiced and in which we should live in peace with one another as good neighbors. Unfortunately  we do not see in the bombardment of civilians with the instruments of destruction and annihilation any indication of tolerance or an incentive to live in peace.171.	The United Nations started its life by blessing the plantation of a racialist  Nazi gang in Palestine-the land of tolerance  love and peace thereby forcing its indigenous population to live in a permanent state of terror  fear and anxiety. The United Nations has also seated in our midst the representatives of this gang  who fill its halls with threats and sacrilege  while the voice of a people among the peoples of the United Nations is choked with terror and fear. In spite of this  the Charter is still viewed by some as a foundation for peace  prosperity and security.172.	Mere respect for the human values embodied in the Charter makes some Member States feel ashamed to refer to it while in word and deed they practice the distortion of facts  truth and honesty. The Charter stressed that we should unite our strength with the peoples of the world in order to maintain international peace and security; but today  after a quarter of a century of endless Zionist crimes  we the States of the world allow the Zionist gang to pursue its aggressive acts against the peoples of the United Nations. We are called upon to stand idle  to allow the Charter to be violated and even to condone this Organization's failure to adopt a resolution calling for a cease-fire  thanks to the United States veto.173.	Some of the practices committed during the lifetime of the United Nations make its founders feel that their expectations were unattainable. The United Nations  as envisioned by the Charter  would be a center for the harmonization and co-ordination of action by all nations to obtain those lofty goals. Nevertheless  we find that unilateral and bilateral actions by the big Powers have taken this Organization completely out of any realm of coordination of international affairs. It has become the rule  and not the exception  for issues to be settled and agreements concluded among the big Powers  the peoples of the United Nations being the very last to know. Let me hasten to state that  while we are proud to be among the peoples of the United Nations  we are in favor of any rapprochement that will strengthen international peace and security. However  we doubt that secret and bilateral agreements take into consideration the interests of the small States and peoples outside the sphere of the big Powers.174.	Let me emphasize that the rapprochement among the big Powers has not yet solved a single one of the many problems which preoccupy the minds of our peoples. Perhaps arrangements have been made among those Powers to satisfy their own interests  but we have yet to see their unified position with regard to the fundamental problems that beset our world  defiling it with war  pain and suffering. This  however  will not cause us to neglect to praise the rapprochement at present taking place between the People's Republic of China and Japan  a rapprochement between two great peoples in a great continent. Such relations can only benefit the struggle of man. One sure consequence will be the assertion that Asia belongs to the Asians and that the future of its peoples lies in self- determination  free from foreign intervention  which has so long sown the seeds of discord and dissension on that troubled continent.175.	May I be permitted to say that we do not hold a pessimistic outlook for the world in which we live. But we do wish to make it abundantly clear that the peoples of the United Nations are not truly represented in our Organization neither on the basis of those who speak on their behalf  nor on the basis of the questions chosen for discussion.176.	Those who represent apartheid in South Africa  a system steeped in blood  shame and suppression  come to this rostrum and call for a war against terrorism. Now  who would agree that the right of man to be free and to regain his dignity can be attained by carrying olive branches against the big sticks  guns and rockets of the racists? The colonialist  racist Portuguese are engaged in daily barbaric acts against the indigenous African peoples  while their spokesman remains in our midst  arguing and threatening. The Government of the United Kingdom has called upon our conscience and demanded strict observance of morality  justice and humanity. What irony! That these demands come from the very country which is responsible for the untold suffering which man has endured in Palestine  Rhodesia and so many other parts of Africa and Asia is ironic indeed.177.	Colonialism planted the seeds of evil in all comers of the world and then slipped away when the price became too high to bear  leaving the victims behind to reap the bitter harvest of their ugly deeds.178.	Such an examination  available to us since the establishment of the United Nations and the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  will clearly show the true nature of the problem. Those who commend the Charter are the very ones who violate it. Those who loudly observe the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights are the very ones who rape the most basic rights of man and his fundamental freedoms. Perhaps the question may arise whether we  the peoples of the United Nations  still have a role to play. Yes  we do. Our role  as the Charter stipulates  is to be tolerant without forfeiting the rights of man  to be friendly without allowing the vindictive to have a place in our midst  to be candid without using distortion  and to be vocal in saying the truth without yielding to pressure. Our respect for the Charter has no place for aggressors  racists  colonialists and those who support them. Only by accepting this role can we affirm that the United Nations has fulfilled its Charter and justified its existence.179.	Since the move to include in the agenda of this session an item on terrorism and violence  existing ill intentions against the Charter and the peoples of the United Nations have become apparent. The hasty inclusion of this item [item 92] was met with surprise by peoples in all corners of the world. For the questions of hijacking  assaults on diplomats and the senseless killing of innocent people and threats to their fundamental freedoms by terror and violence are not new in today's life. Some Member States officially practice such terror on a vast scale. The reaction of complete acceptance of this item by the racist and terrorist States is a ""ploy"" to use it gainfully against the legitimate struggle of the peoples under the yoke of colonialism and alien domination. We notice the fact that these circles tried to prevent a study of the causes of terrorism land violence in an attempt to isolate them from their roots. The reason behind this item and the hasty and artificial manner in which it was included  particularly before it was amended  is to use this forum to serve the temporary goals and propaganda purposes of certain States and criminal elements. Perhaps the awakening of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America will deny these elements the opportunity to use the flag of the United Nations as a means to wage war against the freedom fighters' constant struggle for the liberation of man.180.	We in Africa  Asia and Latin America know what violence is. We live it. Our wounds are still bleeding from it. When we fight it  we do not revert to divorcing it from its roots  from its causes and from the aspirations of those who are living it. Even the Second World War  which led to the formation of the United Nations to prevent the recurrence of war  was in itself a terrorism from which we suffered without participating in its causes or benefiting from its consequences. The fruits of war we enjoyed were the destruction of our towns  the killing of our sons and the suffocation of our freedoms for the sake of the belligerent big Powers. The only benefits we received from this international terrorism were racial discrimination and the seeds of Zionism and limited wars planted in our midst.181.	Let us talk candidly about terrorism and international violence. Since this item was submitted  only those who practice official violence and terror against innocence and freedom discuss it in accordance with the true motives behind it. Zionist gangs have made of it a justification for their barbarous actions against Lebanon and Syria and have used it openly as a means to threaten other Arab States from this rostrum. The United States has used it as an expression of its support for these gangs and as an instrument in its election campaigns. The United Kingdom has used it to complete its chain of actions within the scope of its international policy. South Africa has used it to justify its laws and regulations against the freedom fighters. The list also includes Portugal and others which will try to give their criminal acts a façade of legitimacy under the banner of the United Nations.182.	My delegation does not consider it appropriate that the United Nations should become  even for a few weeks  an instrument in local election campaigns or a pawn of international propaganda based on falsehood and deceit.183.	Let us talk about the terror with which we all live  while the weapons of destruction are stockpiled in the warehouses of the super-Powers  threatening the total ruin of the world. Let us talk about the planes that pour tons of destructive weaponry on innocent people in Palestine and in North Viet-Nam. Let us talk about the destruction of dikes and the endangering of the lives of innocent millions. Let us talk about the fleets of the super-Powers that carry terrorism and violence outside their territorial waters  jeopardizing freedom of passage and international commerce. Let us talk about the mining of harbors without respect for the most basic concepts "" international law  and without even declaring a state of war.184.	The voice which has spoken from this rostrum on behalf of Zionist gangs was created as a result of connivance and concession  attained through pressure tactics and terrorism. Britain delivered the land and the people of Palestine to these usurping butchers who have abused the United Nations with the support of a super-Power. Ask that speaker about his original homeland and about the only justification for his presence in our occupied territory  and then we will talk about international terror and violence.185.	We said earlier that terrorism and violence are a disgrace to the colonial Powers and racist gangs  since they are themselves the roots and causes. But let me assure you that we are never ashamed of anything we do. We have contributed to the world a glowing and full history that does not need elaboration. Our behaviour  in spite of the terrorism of colonialism and the violence and criminal conspiracies of the big Powers against us  remains an exemplary contribution to human progress and to man's civilization. When the foundation of the civilization and the moralities of others are exposed to the dangers of concessions  conspiracies and pressures  our position will be firm and unequivocal. We will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to see that truth is the law of man. The cheap attempts to censure our struggle and the struggle of our brothers in Africa will have only one consequence: namely  to let us know the stand of others against us. Through these very debates and discussions  we shall learn just who stands on the side of the struggle of man  and who tries in vain to obstruct it.186.	Those who seek the creation of artificial storms under the guise of humanitarianism  and the adoption of a resolution or a recommendation by the United Nations on what they label as terrorism and violence are the very ones who openly refuse to implement the resolutions of the United Nations. They are the ones who show contempt for the United Nations by refusing to accept its decisions. Their lack of respect for this august body constitutes in itself a kind of terrorism against the peoples of the United Nations. We must never forget that the Arab peoples that are in a realistic and legitimate state of self-defense are fully aware that the solution of the Palestinian question-namely the problem of the liquidation of Zionist aggression  the taming of Zionist arrogance and the curbing of absolute support by the American fortress of capitalist imperialism-will come only when a practical decision is taken by the Arab peoples themselves: the decision to wage a total war of liberation that will be vindicated by international norms and moral laws and will be dictated by the fundamental human rights to combat aggression and liberate national land from the gangs that occupy it.187.	Let us be realistic and logical. The Charter  human rights and humane motives are no longer the main stimuli in the United Nations. Contrary to the wishes of the peoples of the world  the United Nations has become a puppet whose strings are pulled by influential hands. This is a tragic end to a great human endeavor in a world governed by inhumane motives and greedy self-interest.188.	Certain States have practiced infamous and dastardly terror on our soil which  though the subject of continuous complaint  is yet without sufficient condemnation to place the responsibility where it belongs.189.	In this age of well-publicized concern for the preservation of our ecological environment  let us speak also of the terrorism against our human environment: the mass destruction of our own species. The Arabs are victims of such terrorism. We call for study and the identification of those who are responsible for it. We were among the first to be against Nazi and Fascist terrorism. We fought it at a time when others sought a truce with terror and condoned its ugly practices against our people with resolutions and agreements. Then  when others joined our fight  we continued our struggle to the best of our ability. Finally  when the war was over  the belligerents concluded peace at our expense and without due consideration for our existence. We committed ourselves to be there and without arrogance or selfishness to contribute our humble effort to mankind.190.	The Second World War left a terror that is still in our midst  as witnessed by the systematic and premeditated planting of mines in our land. War no longer exists among the advanced societies which tested their weaponry on our soil and tried their instruments of terror on our people. Let us call them to account for those practices. The planting of mines in the soil of the Libyan Arab Republic and other North African States was an instrument of war used equally by the Allies and the Axis nations. When the war was terminated  those mines were left to defile our human environment  to explode in the faces of our innocent men  women and children  and so to hinder in an effective manner our progress and our development.191.	From a humanitarian point of view  it was imperative that the belligerent States  which later became friends  should give us an indication of the existence of those mines which jeopardized innocent lives and prevented innocent people from exercising their fundamental liberties. But  without a single exception  all refrained from performing this humane and legal duty  leaving it to time and to mines to ""solve"" our problems. The Libyan Arab Republic will not stand idly by  politically or juridically. It will not refrain from asking the States responsible for planting its soil with mines to pay reparations for this inhuman act.192.	Some States have included in the agenda of the United Nations certain tangential items which have been blown up and exaggerated by the mass media. But we believe that the time has come to identify the responsibility for and show the true cause of the deterioration of the world situation. Terrorism and violence and the pollution of the human environment are undoubtedly latent  in spite of the propaganda campaigns  in the inhuman behavior of certain elements and the States that support those who pollute the life of man and defile it. Let us remove the hand of colonialism and exploitation from the peoples of theUnited Nations so that this international gathering will be a true representation of its peoples. Let the people of Namibia come to this hall. Let us remove the grip of Ian Smith and his gang from Rhodesia. Let us condemn the attempts of some States to collaborate with the two racist regimes  in South Africa and Rhodesia.193.	Let us emphatically and with one voice issue a true and courageous proclamation that we are against the colonial presence of Portugal in Africa and against some of the major Powers that support Portugal's strangulation of the freedoms of the indigenous populations.194.	Let us state with a clear voice that the one who speaks on behalf of the Zionist gangs is a racist  Fascist and Nazi  to whom we should not even listen. Let our human environment be purified of the causes of terror and violence  and let all the peoples of the United Nations attain what the Charter has stipulated.195.	The world has changed measurably since the adoption of the Charter. Those changes must be taken into consideration for two reasons. First  the United Nations must be given the effectiveness to prevent its resolutions from being subject to concession and deliberate rejection  consequently restoring its respect and prestige. Second  a true reflection of the world today must include peoples that should be given the opportunity to enrich man's history and contribute to the discussion of his problems.196.	The Arabic language is of great cultural and historical value  having made major contributions to civilization contributions that can be neither ignored nor belittled. It is the language of scores of millions of men; it constitutes a religious reference to hundreds of millions of Moslems all over the world. This language has become a working reality in many of the specialized agencies and human gatherings  a fast which makes it imperative to give it wider scope among the languages of the United Nations. The acceptance of Arabic as an official language of the United Nations will contribute immensely to world literature and civilization.197.	The discussion of the universality of the Organization and the admission of new Members brings us once more to the discussion of the Charter. We cannot agree that the super-Powers have the right to force upon the Organization delegations which do not represent their peoples  or membership for governments which were created as a result of international conspiracies.198.	The debate on the admission of new Members  as included in the agenda [item 23]  is a waste of time and will lead us only to polemics and futile discussion. The most practical procedure remains a recommendation by the Security Council  followed by a debate in the General Assembly; any other procedure will inevitably lead to pain and anxieties which will not serve the interests of this world Organization.199.	We would like to emphasize that any review of the situation of the world today necessitates the compiling of a list of priorities for our debates and also a longer period of debate to enable us responsibly to solve world problems and ensure world progress. The search for peace and security and the stabilization of relations will not be found in the settlements by the rich and big Powers at the expense of the poor and smaller States or at the expense of the colonized and oppressed peoples.200.	Before we can achieve true peace and effective security and before we can preserve the lives of the innocent and protect the fundamental freedoms of man  we have to do the following things: first  liquidate all forms and manifestations of colonialism  neo-colonialism and imperialism; secondly  put an end to the crime of racial discrimination and violations of human rights; thirdly  place the responsibility on the big Powers and other colonial nations for the consequences of their actions and call upon them to participate effectively and in good faith in the solution of the problems created by the tragedies they have caused; and fourthly  review the affairs of our international system  the manner of representation in it and the enforcement of respect for its resolutions and recommendations.201.	The eyes of the world should be focused upon the solution of the fundamental problems  in order to create true stability for future generations  to safeguard them from the scourge of war and to establish conditions that are conducive to progress and prosperity.202.	Injustice of man to man exists  and it is a bitter reality. It will continue  for it cannot be fought with resolutions of international organizations which lack the power to enforce those resolutions or even the will and desire to respect them. Injustice  partiality and alignment remain characteristics of man  especially in international organizations. A world built in such a manner does not augur well  nor does it promise a better future  permanent stability or a just peace. Nevertheless  we assert that the settlement of global problems and the improvement of the gloomy world situation lie in the perseverance and endurance of the peoples of the world and in the determination of man to make this planet a healthy place to live in. For man is the main pillar of the peoples of the United Nations  and he will create peace  security and prosperity.203.	With your permission  Mr. President  before I leave the rostrum I should like to say a few more words  which are not in my Arabic text.204.	Today  Monday  is the first day of the holy Moslem month of Ramadan in the year 1392 of the Moslem calendar  a holy month of fasting  prayer and meditation observed by hundreds of millions of Moslems around the world  millions of human beings of all races and colors and from all regions and nations of our planet. On this occasion  on behalf of the Revolutionary Command Council  the Libyan people and the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic  I should like to convey to our Moslem brothers in this Assembly and to the whole Islamic community throughout the world our sincere congratulations and good wishes.205.	I want also to take this special occasion to stress our belief that we Moslems are determined to contribute to the advancement of humanity and to join in a sincere effort to bring serenity  justice and peace to this troubled world. In keeping with our faith and our cultural heritage  as well as our traditional humanism and tolerance  we shall continue our sacred fight  our jihad  against Zionism  imperialism  colonialism  racism and exploitation wherever they exist in the world."
"70",4144,"LKA",27,1972,"On 22 May of this year a change of historic significance occurred in my country: our political status was altered to that of a Republic. At the same time the name of the country  which under Portuguese occupation of the maritime provinces in the fifteenth century had been changed to Ceylon  was dropped and we resumed the name of Sri Lanka  by which my country was referred to in the ancient chronicles and in Valmiki's epic  the Ramayana. The change of name from ""Ceylon"" to ""Sri Lanka""  or ""the Resplendent Isle""  to give it its closest English translation was not merely a romantic evocation of the past: it was a recognition of the value of our cultural heritage and an affirmation of our cultural affinity with our neighbors in South and Southeast Asia  where the Ramayana is a literary and cultural masterpiece of imperishable value. Therefore  today-for the first time—I address you  Mr. President  and this Assembly as the permanent representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations.142.	The change of Constitution  which took place on 22 May and made us a Republic  severed our link with the British Crown-a link which had lasted for 157 years but Sri Lanka remains within the Commonwealth and will continue to maintain and even endeavor to strengthen the friendly relations that have existed between our country and Britain. This is the spirit that Walt Whitman had in mind when he spoke of that fervent element of manly friendship that is more binding than treaties.143.	Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka and on my own behalf  I extend to you our cordial felicitations on your election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. In congratulating your country and you  we are also congratulating the General Assembly on having selected a President who has already given ample evidence of his adroitness and ability in steering the work of the Assembly and especially in the delicate handling of highly contentious issues. A session that started in a tempest of dissension and acrimony has  through your able captaincy  been placed on an even keel. The weather may turn inclement once again  but at least we feel sure that we are in safe hands. My delegation will at all times be ready to extend to you without reservation its fullest co-operation.144.	As your predecessor we had an eminent Asian  Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  to whom we owe a word of deep appreciation for the manner in which he directed the work of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. That session witnessed the triumph of justice and reason over prejudice and partisanship with the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and thereby brought us closer to the ideal of universality  which is an indispensable condition for the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of the Charter.145.	For the first time after about nine years we are without the serene personality of UThant  our former Secretary-General  whose shining attributes of compassion and unassailable moral and intellectual integrity captivated the minds and hearts of all those who had the privilege of being associated with him during his tenure of office. With an endearing humility of spirit and a total lack of ostentation  speaking with courage and acting with discretion and restraint as the occasion demanded  he made a lasting imprint on international relations.146.	We had an opportunity last year [2031st meeting] to welcome his successor  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose long experience in foreign affairs and international relations will prove an invaluable asset to the Organization. Mr. Waldheim has already demonstrated a sturdy independence  an unflinching initiative and an unfaltering determination to exploit to the limit the scope and authority of his high office. Anyone who displays a vigorous initiative in an organization of such diverse and conflicting interests and policies faces the risk of criticism  often of a captious and destructive nature. I am sure it will not take long for the Organization to realize that It owes as great a duty to the Secretary-General as the Secretary-General himself owes to the Organization  and that duty is to co-operate in a constructive manner in the pursuit of the high ideals to which we have pledged ourselves.147.	Since we last met  there have been many dramatic changes and developments in international affairs and international relationships which cannot but enhance the prospects of international peace and security and help mitigate or eliminate the tensions that have afflicted the world ever since the end of the Second World War. Along with the numerous speakers who have preceded me in this debate and who have made reference to those trends  we welcome the improvement in the relations between the Federal Republic of Germany on the one hand and Poland and the Soviet Union on the other  through the signing of the Warsaw treaty  and the Moscow Treaty   and also the progress towards the establishment of a fraternal understanding between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. These measures  and the complementary stage of the same process that would be a conference on European security and co-operation held between the western and eastern parts of Europe and including the United States of America and Canada  an important element of which would be an agreement on a mutual and balanced reduction of forces in that ""art of the world  are a tribute to those national leaders who have worked tirelessly for their realization. We applaud these efforts and are gratified by the success that has so far attended them and express our sincere wishes for their final consummation  which would make Europe the envy of the rest of the world and an example worthy of emulation. We would only hope that  while justifiably and understandably concentrating on the improvement of relations between themselves  the architects of European security will not consider themselves relieved of any responsibility for assisting in the creation of similar conditions of peace and stability in other parts of the world and that they will do their utmost to remove the causes of violent conflict and almost incurable enmity in the Middle East  to end the fratricidal war in former IndoChina and also to eradicate the vicious practices and repressive policies that are still pursued by white minority regimes and Governments in Africa and by the Government of Portugal in its African Territories.148.	In Asia  too  there have been developments in recent times which augur well for the future. The decision of the Governments of China and Japan to establish diplomatic relations with each other will erase the grim and sombre memories of past antagonisms and will  by bringing to an end 35 years of hostility and estrangement  provide the foundation for political  economic and cultural co-operation between two of the most powerful countries in Asia. My delegation would like to pay a tribute to the leaders on both sides for their bold and imaginative statesmanship and especially to the Government of China for its magnanimous gesture in waiving all claim to war reparations. History has shown that peace with penalty is only a respite for revenge. We are confident that in this instance the Chinese Government's decision will prevent a repetition of Europe's unhappy experience after the First World War.149.	Another development of profound importance is the declared intention of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Japan to commence negotiations leading to a peace treaty between the two countries. The success of these negotiations must have a powerful impact on the political and economic future of Asia.150.	The leaders of China and the United States are to be congratulated on their endeavors to resume friendly contacts between their Governments and peoples endeavors which were punctuated in dramatic manner by what I believe was the first visit of a United States President to China. Equally welcome and praise worthy are the signs of increasing co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in spheres of common interest and especially in regard to the control of armaments.151.	The exchanges that have been taking place between North and South Korea through the medium of the Red Cross organizations of the two divided parts of that country will  we hope  be the starting-point in a process that will lead to a final composition of their differences and ultimately bring about the reunification of that country.152.	These moves towards reconciliation between former foes show a proper respect for the principles of the Charter and disclose a healthy attitude of enlightened self-interest on the part of those concerned. They will help promote conditions conducive to co-operation  stability and progress in Asia.153.	The Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 between President Bhutto of Pakistan and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India contains the principal elements that can put an end to the mutual suspicion and sullen hostility that have separated India and Pakistan ever since the partition  provided the implementation of the Agreement accords with the spirit of its terms. Given such conscientious implementation of the Agreement  not merely will the risk of future armed clashes be avoided  but there will be a definite assurance that any disagreement that may arise hereafter will be settled amicably and that lasting friendship and enduring co-operation will replace the implacable enmity of the last 25 years. Nothing  therefore  should be allowed to defer such a final implementation of the Agreement.154.	It is to be hoped that the same spirit will prevail so that a firm and lasting friendship may be established between Pakistan and Bangladesh. For our part we have  like the vast majority of Members of the United Nations  extended diplomatic recognition to Bangladesh and have supported its admission to the specialized agencies. We  therefore  support its application for admission to the United Nations [A/8754S/10759J. We are  however  far from satisfied that the initiative taken to include this item in the General Assembly's agenda under the general title ""Admission of new Members to the United Nations"" [item 23] is in the best interests of Bangladesh  as it might have exactly the opposite effect from what the proponents of the item intended. The very procedure is of dubious constitutionality. Unfortunately  it is a mark of human frailty that the ends we seek to achieve are too often imperiled by the means we choose to adopt. The interests of Bangladesh would be best served at this juncture if the efforts of the international community were concentrated on removing the obstacles to the establishment of good relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh and on effecting a reconciliation between the two countries which must result inevitably in not merely the recognition by Pakistan of the existence of Bangladesh but also recognition in the full diplomatic sense.155.	We would draw particular attention to Security Council resolution 307 (1971)  which ""calls upon all those concerned to take all measures necessary to preserve human life and for the observance of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and to apply in full their provisions as regards the protection of the wounded and sick  prisoners of war and the civilian population"". We trust that  if there are impediments  legal or practical or even political  which obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Conventions regarding the repatriation of the prisoners of war  they will be speedily removed  due regard being given to articles 118 and 119 of the third Geneva Convention.  At the same time  we hope that the 30 000. Bengalis who belonged to the Pakistan armed forces and the approximately 10 000 Bengali administrative personnel now in Pakistan will be permitted to exercise their option to build their future in Bangladesh and help in the reconstruction and development of that country.156.	We make these observations  not in any spirit of criticism  but from a desire to see peace and friendly relations established and maintained throughout the entire subcontinent. We are inclined to believe that this result could be achieved if the parties concerned were left to their own devices without any interference from outside other than encouragement and assistance in attaining agreement.157.	There are many here  we are aware  who treat the prisoner-of-war issue as the crux of the problem  rather than the recognition by Pakistan of Bangladesh-however devoutly we may wish such recognition to be accorded. It would not be consonant with the spirit and the letter of the third Geneva Convention of 1949 to make the recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan a condition of the release of the prisoners of war. The third Geneva Convention is patently clear on the conditions that should govern the release of prisoners of war. At the same time we must point out that the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations cannot be made subject to the release of the prisoners of war.158.	Our appeal to all the parties concerned would be to work for a settlement the principal and indispensable elements of which would be the release of all prisoners of war  excluding those liable to trial for crimes committed in the prosecution of the war  and the repatriation by Pakistan of the 30 000 Bengalis who were members of the Pakistan armed forces and of the approximately 10 000 Bengali civilians in Pakistan  most of whom are administrators  provided they wish to return. There is a third element  the mutual recognition of Bangladesh and Pakistan  which we would commend to them. If agreement is reached on these measures  if action to implement them is synchronized and if there are reliable guarantees -against the breach of the obligations assumed under such an agreement  the main obstacle to the creation of peace and harmony throughout the subcontinent would be removed. The Simla Agreement has already provided a favourable climate for a final solution  and other outstanding issues such as the question of assets and liabilities  which have been satisfactorily resolved in the past on the Indian subcontinent  should present no insuperable problem.159.	The war in IndoChina continues a war without mercy and a war without end-heaping misery and devastation on an area already bled white by more than 30 years of continuous warfare and ruined and devastated by a policy of relentless bombing surpassing in scale anything experienced during the Second World War. Is it not possible to profit by the lessons of history and to accept the reality that the human spirit  in the defense of what it considers to be its legitimate rights  is indomitable and indestructible and that no weapon has yet been discovered that can reduce it to submission? An entire people may be flattened into eternity  but that spirit will survive. We hope reason and realism will prevail.160.	Although the world had been led to believe that a search for a military solution had been disclaimed  it does not appear to have yet been abandoned. What is needed is an immediate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a fully representative Government of national unity which will have both the political will and the capacity to repair the havoc of war and release the people of Viet-Nam from the terror that has haunted them for three decades.161.	We in Sri Lanka view with increasing anxiety and concern the present state of relations between the Soviet Union and China and the lack of progress towards a reconciliation between China and India. The misunderstandings that separate these nations  whose cordial relationship with one another once offered the brightest hope for Asian progress and unity  must be overcome without the least delay  not merely in the interests of the Asian continent alone  but in the greater interest of international peace and security  thereby releasing the energies and resources of their peoples for the more constructive task of economic development.162.	In the Middle East a tenuous ceasefire has been rudely disturbed by a sudden eruption of acts of terrorism and violence directed against innocent persons and these acts have served as a pretext for savage reprisals no less grotesquely brutal and terroristic than those which they seek to punish. The United States Secretary of State  Mr. William Rogers  showed admirable statesmanship and fair-mindedness in his treatment of this explosive question when he addressed the General Assembly /2038th meeting]. His objectivity and perceptiveness were in luminous contrast to the approach of others to a problem that should take both humanitarian and political factors into account.163.	There are too many inclined to imagine that terrorism began in Munich. We have no hesitation in condemning terrorism  irrespective of those who resort to it  but if we are genuinely interested in putting an end to terrorism  and not merely in seeking in a spirit of partisanship to make political capital of acts of terrorism  we must examine  and strive to extirpate  the causes of terrorism and the situations which drive men to such acts. The causes are despair and frustration- despair at ever getting justice from the Organization chiefly responsible for the injustice. Despair of this type is no different from lunacy and finds expression either in melancholy brooding or in insensate violence. The several hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have lost their homes  who daily witness the demolition of their houses and the expropriation of their property with meaningless offers of compensation and without the dimmest hope of proper restitution  have been forgotten by the Organization responsible for their fate and their plight.164.	As Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories  I have been deeply disturbed by the attitude of many Members of this Organization when the reports of the Special Committee are considered  Members who think it fair and proper to abstain in the vote on draft resolutions protesting unmistakable and proven violations of the human rights of the population of the occupied territories  but who suddenly find themselves roused out of their torpor by the senseless savagery displayed at Munich and at the Lod airport. Had this Organization acted in a responsible manner  the events at Munich and Lod would not have stained the pages of contemporary history. To the credit of the Secretary-General  it must be stated that at the first opportunity he did bring the question before this Assembly [A/8791 and Add.lJ  but the record of the voting at the 2037th meeting on the eminently fair  reasonable and objective amendment moved by the representative of Saudi Arabia [A/L.673]  which chose to put the problem in its proper perspective and to focus attention on the causes of terrorism rather than on the condemnation of individual acts  clearly shows that what is still needed is a more widespread sense of impartiality and justice in the treatment of this problem. Thanks to the representative of Saudi Arabia  we shall now be able to go to the root of the problem and to deal with it in a manner which we hope will prevent future Munichs and Lods.165.	We have already referred to the vicious practices of apartheid in Africa and Portugal's ruthless suppression of the freedom movement in its African territories. There are disturbing signs that on the most specious of pretexts  but prompted solely by material considerations of economic advantage  certain Western Powers  in reckless and unconscionable disregard for moral principle or legal obligation  are providing encouragement  solace and support to the regimes and policies of the white minorities in Africa  which have been universally condemned. Nobody could have taken seriously the argument that a denial of foreign investment to South Africa would only injure the interests of the black Africans.166.	We have on our agenda again this year the items relating to the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [item 35] and a World Disarmament Conference /item 26]. In addition  we have a new item assigned for discussion in plenary meetings and entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [item 25J.167.	The Secretary-General's report [A/8775 and Add. 1-4] does not disclose any original suggestions from any State regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  nor has the Security Council itself so far succeeded in presenting a report on performance  though drafts have been presented which are no more than a restatement of our obligations.168.	As for the World Disarmament Conference  we do not object to the participation of all States in the discussion of this vital subject  but it is an admission of the failure of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  after all these years of its existence and after an enlargement of its membership  that it is now considered necessary to hold a world conference on disarmament. The approach to disarmament continues to be materialistic rather than moralistic: the approach of reducing armaments and outlawing certain types of weapons of mass destruction rather than examining the circumstances that impel countries to engage in an arms race and the causes of war and making an effort to eliminate them. Yet another preposterous fallacy is that nuclear testing is regarded essentially as a matter of pollution; hence the excitement displayed at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment over atmospheric tests. We work ourselves into ecstasy over the two super-Powers' treaty limiting the number of anti-ballistic missile systems that they may retain and their agreement on limitations on strategic offensive weapons. The limits that those Powers still permit themselves for the development and the further sophistication of nuclear weapons will not reduce in the least the threat of annihilation that faces the world as long as nuclear weapons are held by any State or States. Possessing the capacity to destroy each other and even the world several times over  the super-Powers cannot expect the world to be overwhelmed with relief over agreements which merely curtail the multiple lethal capacity that they already possess. We would suggest that what we need is a world conference on the removal of the causes of war through the total elimination of injustice and the adoption of positive measures for the removal of social and economic inequalities between nations. That is the true meaning of peace and progress.169.	As regards the materialistic approach to disarmament  we have consistently maintained that the only guarantee of the avoidance of a nuclear war lies in a program of action to which all nuclear Powers would be irrevocably committed and which would comprise the following measures: in the first instance  a categorical undertaking by the nuclear Powers not to use  or threaten to use  nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States  combined with an unequivocal and total renunciation of the right to use nuclear weapons; second  the conclusion of a complete or comprehensive test-ban treaty by the prohibition of underground tests; third  the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the freezing of the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons; and fourth  the gradual dismantling of the total apparatus of nuclear terror.170.	We have no right to condemn any country which conducts atmospheric tests  especially if it has only an embryonic nuclear armory  while we leave others free to conduct underground tests to add to an already existing nuclear armory of phenomenal proportions.171.	We must express our disappointment at the failure of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to produce a draft agreement on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their elimination from the arsenals of all States. We recall that there was an implied assurance on the part of those major Powers that were pressing for the adoption of the Convention on bacteriological weapons last year that  if it was adopted  we could expect to be rewarded with an agreement on the banning of chemical weapons this year. We cannot but help observing that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has not kept faith with the General Assembly.172.	Our general approach to the question of international peace and security and to disarmament  which is that it must seek to remove the causes of war  dictates our attitude to the question of the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. There is an appealing touch of idealism in the contention that if the question of the non-use of force calls for prohibiting the use of weapons of all types  all States will be in a position of equality and none will receive unilateral military advantages. We cannot but agree with the proposition  as stated in the Soviet memorandum regarding the inclusion of this item in the agenda [A/8793]  self-evident as that proposition is  that the prohibition of the use of both nuclear and conventional weapons is fully in keeping with the principle of ensuring an equal measure of security for all States. But it appears to us that in the conditions that exist in the world today such an approach is lacking in realism. We very much wish that the assumptions underlying it were justified. Those who advance this proposition must ask themselves  why is it that States wish to arm themselves either with nuclear or conventional weapons or both  and how could the prohibition of the use of such weapons be reconciled with the right to produce and possess them and  further  what exactly is meant by an equal measure of security for all States? We can exhaust all the resources of rhetoric in the discussion of such questions on such premises and assumptions  but we forget that  even if all men are supposed to have been born equal  all nations are not  and never can be  equal in power or capacity.173.	We feel a sense of dismay that countries which appeal to us to refrain from the use of force in international relations and the overwhelming majority of us here have never used force in international relations find it difficult to agree to the one positive and constructive proposal that could promote international peace and security even in the absence of high-sounding declarations  and that is the creation of zones of peace. The fact that at the 2022nd meeting only half the members of this Assembly voted in favor of the 13-Power draft resolution-which became resolution 2832 (XXVI)-presented last year on the initiative of my delegation and the Tanzanian delegation for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace shows how remote we are from reality when we welcome anti-ballistic missile agreements and the limitation of strategic offensive arms  but view with suspicion and apprehension a proposal for the exclusion of a sizable section of the world from the arms race  a proposal which seeks to free that area from the military presence of the powerful nations.174.	We shall do our utmost at this session to secure some progress in regard to the proposal for declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace and hope that those who have a genuine interest in the strengthening of international peace and security will support our endeavors.175.	At the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Georgetown  Guyana  in August this year  which was attended by 59 countries as members  a Declaration was adopted in which the Foreign Ministers  noting with satisfaction the adoption by the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  ""considered that this initiative of third world countries and non-aligned states was a significant contribution to the strengthening of international security and that its implementation would greatly reinforce the emerging structures of world peace and help create conditions for progress towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. Moreover  they were of the view that the implementation of this Declaration would strengthen the conditions of peace  security and co-operation in an important region of the third world""  and agreed to co-ordinate their action at this session of the United Nations. 176.	The Georgetown Conference also noted that ""the Mediterranean is increasingly becoming an area for the display of rival military forces"" and ""welcomed the initiative taken towards convening a conference of non- aligned Mediterranean countries and those anxious and ready to work towards making the Mediterranean a sea of peace and co-operation among the peoples of the area"". 177.	So far as the proposal for declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is concerned  our ultimate objective is the removal of all foreign bases from the territories of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean; but our first step must be to secure the exclusion of great-Power rivalry and the great-Power military presence from the Indian Ocean  without denying any littoral or hinterland State the right to maintain a military potential that would satisfy the minimum requirements of its security and guarantee it freedom from external interference.178.	Along with other non-aligned countries present at the Georgetown Conference  we expressed our satisfaction at the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 27 November 1971 by five South-east Asian countries  which ""expressing their determination to secure recognition of and respect for Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace  Freedom and Neutrality  free from any form of menace or interference by outside Powers . . . welcomed this move as a positive development and called upon all States to respect these objectives"". My Government supports the Kuala Lumpur Declaration without reservation.179.	Let me now turn to those problems that affect the daily lives and the general well-being of our people  namely  the problems of trade and development. The most significant event of the year was the third session of UNCTAD  held in Santiago  Chile. Once more the hopes of developing countries to secure from UNCTAD  in pursuance of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)}  specific and positive commitments from the developed countries to measures and policies designed to improve the trading prospects of developing countries and the volume  conditions and terms of financial aid for their development were disappointed.180.	The address to the third session of UNCTAD by Mr. Robert S. McNamara  President of the World Bank the first occasion on which he addressed such a conference-contains some illuminating  if depressing  statistics. The President drew pointed attention to the fact that in the poorest countries of the world  those with a per capita gross national product of less than $200 but comprising 67 per cent of the population of the world  per capita income during the First Development Decade grew at a rate of only 1.5 per cent annually and that  although the developed countries  in adopting the Strategy for the Second Development Decade and in order to meet the targets for growth  agreed that external aid to be provided in the form of official development assistance should reach 0.7 per cent of the gross national product by 1975  the contribution from the wealthiest nation in the world  the United States  whose gross national product is roughly half of the total gross national product of the developed countries  showed a steady decline from above 0.5 per cent in the early years of the last decade to 0.31 per cent in 1970  with the prospect of a further fall to about 0.24 per cent by 1975. The President of the World Bank came to the disturbing conclusion that the total flow of official development assistance for the first half of the Decade was likely to reach approximately 0.35 per cent of the gross national product  or only half the target for the Decade.181.	Other statistics quoted by the President of the World Bank demonstrate even more startlingly the gaping chasm between the standards of living of the developed countries  with a quarter of the world's population  and the standards of living of the remaining three quarters of the world's population that live in the developing countries. The average per capita income in the developed countries  as the President of the World Bank pointed out  is approximately $2 400 per annum compared with the figure of $180 in the developing countries; by 1980 the per capita income in the developed countries is expected to rise by approximately $1 200 compared with an increase of less than $100 in per capita income in the developing countries  even given the attainment of the growth target set for the Second Development Decade. The President of the World Bank also pointed out that at constant prices the total gross national product of the developed countries is expected to rise from $2 000 billion in 1970 to $3 000 billion by 1980 and that if the developed countries have to raise the present level of official development assistance  which stands at 0.35 per cent of their gross national product  to the target of 0.7 per cent which they have set themselves  they need transfer to the developing countries only 1.5 per cent of the increase in their gross national product  or $15 billion  leaving the balance of 98.5 per cent of the increase  or $985 billion  to meet their own internal needs. It is almost like an excess profits tax or sumptuary tax of 1.5 per cent  which they can comfortably afford and the benefit of which they will receive as the purchasing power of the beneficiaries of their aid increases.182.	Those statistics  even if the figures of assistance reflect only official development assistance  show how far removed promise is from fulfillment. The developing countries must rely overwhelmingly on official development assistance  as private development assistance does not always favor the social aspirations or appreciate the economic policies and political problems of the recipient countries.183.	It is in the light of these realities that the achievement of the third session of UNCTAD must be judged. The question of stable prices for primary commodities  on which the majority of developing countries depend to a disproportionate extent for their earnings of foreign exchange to finance their development schemes  received cavalier treatment at that session. Some slight success was achieved in regard to the scheme of supplementary financing to provide facilities better  more dependable and more timely than those existing at present through the International Monetary Fund in order to rescue the development plans of developing countries from the dislocation and disruption that could be caused by unforeseen declines in their export earnings. With the support of the United Kingdom  Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany  the developing countries secured a resolution which calls for the preparation of a scheme  including an assessment of its cost  which would enable the international community to agree to provide the resources to finance the scheme. 184.	The third session of UNCTAD also failed to achieve any real progress in regard to the proposal for establishing a link between special drawing rights and aid for development or in regard to the acceptance of the principle that the major share of the next issue of special drawing rights should go to the developing countries. Once again  the United Kingdom's more progressive attitude helped to secure a recognition from the Conference of the need for the subject of the link to be given the most serious attention  and for the International Monetary Fund to be requested to study and report as early as possible  with a view to the possible implementation of a viable scheme. As I remarked in a different forum  I hope this will not go down in history as the missing link.185.	In regard to the reform of the international monetary system  some slight satisfaction was obtained by the developing countries like a crumb from the rich man's table-in the form of the representation of the developing countries in the group to which the task of making proposals for the reform of the international monetary system was entrusted  the Committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues.186.	To sum up  the third session of UNCTAD gave the developing countries some little hope  but no help. In approaching the future the developing countries would do well to take serious note of the fact that the contemporary economic scene is dominated  and will for some time be dominated  by four economic giants. There is the new phenomenon of the international economic cartel  regionally organized and best exemplified by the European Common Market  which as from January 1973 will grow in size  capacity and influence with the accession of the United Kingdom  Denmark and Ireland. The other three giants are the world's most powerful economy  that of the United States  the formidable economy of Japan  with new prospects opening up to it through improved relations with its most powerful neighbors  and  at the other end of the scale  the closely-knit  State controlled economies of the socialist countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Those which are left are the developing countries  known as the ""Group of 77"" but actually consisting of about 95 countries  with little prospect or means of co-operation except in their appeals to the developed nations.187.	Sri Lanka's experience in regard to the problem of commodity prices and the maintenance of a proper equilibrium in its terms of trade is almost without parallel. For nearly two decades we have suffered a steady and persistent deterioration in our terms of trade  which fell from an annual average of 142 for the period 1952-1956 to an average of 88 for the period 1968-1970. While at first the deterioration was due chiefly to the rapid rise in import'prices accompanied by stagnation in export prices  the problem has been accentuated more recently by a sharp drop in rubber prices. As regards our foreign reserves  the average deficit rose from 69 million rupees for the period 1952-1956 to an average of 1 003 million rupees for the period 1968-1970. It is little comfort to us to be told that we must tighten our belts. What we need is the means to tide us over our difficulties and the external finance to keep our industrial sector operating to full capacity so as to prevent increasing unemployment.188.	Foreign assistance in appropriate quantities on easy terms and at the moment of need is vital to our survival. The most striking example of such assistance and one which on behalf of my Government I must acknowledge with profound gratitude is the munificent aid received by my country at a critical period last year from the Government of the People's Republic of China  which gave us a freely convertible foreign-exchange loan of $25 million  free of interest  with repayment spread over 12 years after a grace period of three years. The features of this loan taken together make it unique in the history of foreign aid. Again this year  during the course of the state visit to Peking of my Prime Minister  Mrs. Bandaranaike  the Government of the People's Republic of China gave further and convincing evidence of its generosity and good will towards developing countries and its determination to adhere to the policy of foreign aid which it commended to the participants at the third session of UNCTAD.189.	While singling out the People's Republic of China for special mention  and that for good reason  I should like on behalf of my Government to express our sincere thanks to the members of the Aid Ceylon Consortium and others who do not belong to it for the help that they have given us in the past and continue to give us. We are not unmindful of the official assistance given to us on very liberal terms by Australia  Canada and the United Kingdom-a true mark of Commonwealth solidarity that transcends all other differences.190.	During its spring and summer sessions the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction succeeded -in making sufficient progress  especially through the adoption of a list of subjects and issues [A/8721 and Corr.l  para. 23] to be brought before the third United Nations conference on the law of the sea  to justify the General Assembly in preparing for the contingency of a formal inauguration of the conference some time next year while the General Assembly is in session and to ask the Committee to utilize the provision made for two sessions in the spring and summer of 1973 to advance its preparations for the conference. 191.	Discussions in the Committee during the past two years have made it transparently clear that agreement on the various issues which will come before the third conference on the law of the sea will be attainable only if there is a willingness to revise the archaic interpretation of the existing doctrine of the freedom of the high seas  which does not provide for equality of opportunity in fact  but only in theory  and if the extent of the demand for the adoption of the concept of an economic zone or patrimonial sea is appreciated. Inflexible adherence to the practices hitherto permitted and the privileges hitherto enjoyed by a relatively few major maritime Powers under their anachronistic interpretation of the doctrine of the freedom of the high seas will need to be replaced by a more just and equitable adaptation of that doctrine to suit the economic realities of the modern world. The conference should become not a confrontation between the major maritime Powers and the rest of the world but rather an occasion for the mutual accommodation of their interests and needs  subject to the paramount consideration of reducing the existing economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries.192.	We do not want the weak to inherit the earth. All that we ask is that the powerful should help the weak to build a world in which an increasing measure of social justice between nations can be realized  so that in the remaining .years of this century the United Nations can succeed in redeeming the bleak record of its first 27 years."
"71",4258,"LUX",27,1972,"Mr. President  in addressing this twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly I am very happy to offer you the heartiest congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of this august Assembly. Your unanimous choice was not only a just recognition of your great personal qualities but also a tribute to the country of great diplomatic and other traditions which you represent. We are confident that under your enlightened guidance  and I would say thanks to it  the present session will fulfill the hopes which the peoples we represent have placed in us.45.	I should like also to express to the Secretary-General  Kurt Waldheim  our great esteem for the outstanding job he has already done for the Organization. During this first year of his mandate the Secretary-General has been endlessly active in all United Nations fields and we can only congratulate him on the positive results which he has already achieved in so short a space of time. He has taken over the direction of the Secretariat at a crucial moment for the Organization and it is certainly appropriate that he should consider the re-establishment of the authority and the prestige of the United Nations as one of the primary objectives to be attained. It goes without saying that this task does not concern the Secretary-General alone; it is of primary interest to each of the sovereign countries which make up the United Nations  and it is only ever more complete and open collaboration among all the Member States which can give the Organization its proper place in the world.46.	Our Organization has reached an important crossroads in its history. The participation of the People's Republic of China represents a major landmark on the road to universality  and it is precisely because I want to see us persevere on this road that I hope for the speedy admission of Bangladesh. The entry of that State into the United Nations would be the logical consequence and the complete and sincere application of the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972.47.	In our view a difficult hurdle to clear in the interest of ensuring universality is the admission of the divided States of Europe and Asia. However  I must say that I am optimistic following the encouraging developments in Germany which I hope will make it possible to bring about the. normalization of relations between the two German States and  in consequence  their simultaneous admission to the United Nations.48.	I also note with satisfaction that contacts have been established between North and South Korea  and for my part I am convinced that here again common sense will triumph and the parties concerned will find a settlement which will take due account of the essential interests of the Korean people as a whole. In such circumstances that is  whenever the parties are themselves moving in the direction desired by all our Assembly must refrain from a debate which might arouse too many passions and arguments drawn from the past at a time when a page of history is about to be turned and preparations are being made for the future.49.	If one considers the present international situation other developments which seem to us to be encouraging cannot fail to be noted. The most striking event in this respect seems to me to be the detente which has appeared in the relations between the United States of America and both the Soviet Union and China. We must rejoice to see the leaders of the great Powers giving ever greater priority to dialog and to the search for common grounds of agreement and co-operation. Our international community as a whole welcomes this desire to avoid as far as possible confrontations which are too often due to considerations of prestige and power and to the desire to settle their disputes peacefully.50.	This climate of detente and co-operation has already made possible considerable progress towards a return to a normal situation in the heart of Europe thanks to the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and to the considerable improvement in relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. Similarly  the ratification of treaties prohibiting the use of force between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union on the one hand and the Federal Republic of Germany and your country  Mr. President  on the other  augur well for the conference on security and co-operation in Europe  the preparatory work for which is to begin shortly in Helsinki.51.	As the representative of a very small European country which twice in the twentieth century suffered terribly from confrontations between its great neighbors  I am particularly happy that there are new prospects for Europe to be entirely peaceful  turned towards cooperation and  indeed towards competition in the economic  social and cultural fields  but at last with no further recourse to force or even to the threat of force.52.	While I can at last express my satisfaction at the positive development in what is traditionally called East- West relations  I am  however  particularly sorry to note the persistence of serious conflicts which take the form of open or threatened hostilities in Viet-Nam and in the Middle East  in spite of all the efforts to bring about peace which have indeed already resulted in a substantial withdrawal of military forces and military experts.53.	As regards the Vietnamese conflict  the slow pace of the Paris negotiations must cause despair to a people that has endured the ravages of war for more than 30 years and whose country is slowly undergoing total destruction. I express the profound hope that efforts towards an equitable peace will no longer be held back by considerations of tactics and prestige and that each party will at least scrupulously respect the rules of war and simple humanity  both in regard to prisoners of war and to the prohibition against striking civilian targets and endangering the lives of civilians.54.	Another trouble spot in the world with respect to which our Organization has  regrettably  thus far displayed almost total impotence is the conflict in the Middle East. Innumerable hours of debate in the General Assembly and the Security Council and numerous resolutions have been devoted to various aspects of this dismaying problem without  as must be acknowledged  any solution having really come closer. My Government remains convinced that the basis for a settlement remains the principles set out in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and here  again  I can only subscribe to everything that Minister Harmel said from this rostrum this morning [2054th meeting] which must finally be implemented either totally or  if that is not possible  at least step by step.55.	On the contrary  we see  unfortunately  on the one hand the Arab States refusing to negotiate and adhering to an attitude that leaves no way out  an attitude of ""all or nothing""  instead of recognizing that everywhere in the world only negotiation has made it possible to achieve solutions to conflicts. And on the other hand we see Israel  for its part  deliberately or through the simple passage of time  daily consolidating its position in the occupied territories. Negotiations  direct or indirect because we are all anxious to spare the susceptibilities of all the parties concerned seem to me to be an elementary course  and probably the only course  to reach a valid compromise. Those who oppose negotiations must seek inspiration from other recent experiences of the great Powers which I have already mentioned-and derive confidence from the dynamism of negotiations. To wish to get the last possible concession before actually negotiating is an attitude which is  in my estimation and on the basis of history  unrealistic. Organizations such as ours-through the intermediary  for instance  of the mediator Mr. Jarring  in whom my Government again expresses its confidence -and States or groups of States may make suggestions for a settlement or offer their good offices in order to bring the parties together; but the principal responsibility remains and will always remain that of those parties.56.	The events of past weeks  the terrorist attacks and the reprisals offer little room for optimism. The Government of Luxembourg condemns terrorism in all its forms and deplores the innocent victims that it has produced. I was in Munich at the time of the massacre in September and I was horrified by the violence inflicted upon innocent victims. We are therefore prepared for our part to associate ourselves with all actions that may be undertaken to repress terrorism  be that here or in any other  more restricted context. We are convinced that only determined action by all the nations can bear fruit  just as we are convinced that that solidarity is in the interest of all the Member States.57.	I must add that my Government condemns equally vigorously blind reprisals which produce innocent victims. Moral law must always prevail over so-called requirements of security and must prohibit the taking of the smallest risk that one will miss the target and kill even one innocent person.58.	Terrorism and reprisals are a vicious circle which has a chance of being broken only if an over-all settlement of the problem of the Middle East is reached  a settlement which must  of course  extend to the Palestine refugees-and I have constantly repeated that it is dangerous and wrong to neglect or underestimate this aspect of the problem. This pessimism which the situation has inspired in me and in many others should be a stimulant to action  not a brake on it.59.	The serious events to which I have just referred-be they encouraging or depressing-have this in common: they highlight the very small influence exercised in the past or being exercised at present by the United Nations. We are bound to acknowledge that there is still a very difficult road ahead in regard to bringing about international security through the adoption of effective collective measures for the purpose of preventing or removing threats to peace  repressing acts of aggression and reaching a peaceful settlement of disputes or situations which might lead to conflicts.60.	Of course  progress has already been made in the limitation of arms by virtue of international treaties which prohibit certain forms of nuclear tests and limit the production of certain types of nuclear or biological weapons  especially on the bilateral level  where the United States and the Soviet Union have concluded the first treaty whose purpose is to limit the production and the use of certain strategic arms.61.	But we are also bound to note that more than 10 years of negotiation in the field of disarmament have produced only extremely modest results if one recalls that since 1960 more than $2 million million has been used for the manufacture of all sorts of war material. It is therefore essential to adopt political decisions internationally in order to modify the situation and to make it possible at last to make available for peaceful purposes the extraordinary resources that might thus be liberated.62.	I should also like to express the hope that the work that has been going on for many years to give peace-keeping operations a more solid basis will soon be crowned with success. Public opinion in our countries can no longer understand why a program for the use of forces in the service of peace cannot be concluded after such lengthy discussions and such important negotiations.63.	The general mission of a world organization encompassing more than 130 sovereign countries becomes increasingly more complex and difficult for a multitude of reasons. Improvements in the means of transport and communication  the development of industrial  commercial and financial networks throughout the world and the continuing progress of science and technology are such that States are becoming ever-more interdependent notwithstanding their sovereignty. This means that an increasing number of problems can no longer be solved within a strictly national context and  accordingly  international organizations have been given  and will increasingly be given  new tasks.64.	It is evident that the machinery for international and multinational co-operation is not sufficiently perfected to permit of the immediate solution of all these problems at the world level. Certain problems  as must be recognized  have become particularly acute on a regional plane  and it is frequently easier to arrive  at least in the first stage  at valid solutions applicable in a restricted area before extending or generalizing the solution on a world-wide basis.65.	It is in that light that for decades my country has been taking part in all efforts at co-operation and integration capable not only of bringing about economic progress but also of guaranteeing more stability for our own continent. Beginning with the Union economique belgo-luxembourgeoise and including the Benelux Economic Union  we have from the very first taken part in the building of integrated Europe.66.	The meeting of the heads of State and Government of the nine countries of the expanded European Economic Community  which will take place in Paris in two weeks  will  I hope  lay down the essential guide-lines for the future of the Community and will  I am sure  give a decisive impetus towards increasing unification which can never be synonymous in our minds with falling back upon oneself  but  on the contrary  means opening towards the outside world. If Europe is to have greater weight  it will have to shoulder even more clearly its responsibility  first vis-a-vis the developing countries  but also vis-a-vis other industrialized countries. A Community which is the greatest commercial power in the world  even if it is not the least fragile  has the right  indeed the duty  to affirm its own identity and to deal on a footing of equality with the other industrialized States concerning economic  commercial and monetary problems without there being any question of any prior conditions either way  and this with the sole purpose of reaching settlements satisfactory to all the countries concerned.67.	Such a Community has the special duty to take the greatest account of the needs of all the countries of the third world and most especially of those who have been our partners from the very first.68.	The third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development fUNCTAD]  held in the spring in Santiago  Chile  did not  unfortunately  live up to expectations. But is it not true that public opinion sometimes tends to expect too much from great conferences of this kind? After all  the achievement of tangible results in a field so complex and controversial requires persevering and continuous co-operation based upon a common political will. Moreover  I feel that what harmed that session of UNCTAD was that an attempt was made to discuss and resolve every tiling simultaneously.69.	Nevertheless  it would be unfair to minimize the results obtained at that session  which recognized the need to have the developing countries participate in the rearrangement of the international monetary system and to devote special attention to aid to the least developed countries. The session likewise made possible a better understanding of highly varied problems posed by development. Now  we have to implement the decisions adopted  to infuse the will to act and to offer the means to do so to the United Nations organizations concerned  as well as to all the other institutions which  both nationally and internationally  are dealing with developmental problems.70.	The countries of the European Community will no longer be able to take refuge behind the absence of world-wide solutions in order not to move forward  but they will not accept criticism concerning the regionalism of their aid on the part of those that stick solely to bilateral aid.71.	In regard to the environment  over and above national issues there are the needs of mankind which transcend the borders of States and require rational international cooperation on a world-wide basis. Nevertheless  it will be necessary to avoid having the just preoccupation with the future of mankind on earth hide from us present injustices and disorder. The setting of priorities for action to be taken will have to be such as to weigh carefully all the problems to be resolved. This is one of the primary tasks of the present session of the Assembly to point the way. Here I can only say that I applaud what my colleague and friend  Mr. Schmelzer  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  has said on this subject [2050th meeting].72.	It might also be appropriate to add to these considerations on under-development and the protection of environment a few brief reflections on this intellectual and moral pollution caused by racial discrimination as it exists today. It ought to be clear to any man of good sense that  while there may be characteristics peculiar to every race  no race is superior to any other  and therefore there is no justification for separation or segregation by force  which is nothing but a manifestation of the arrogance of certain human beings vis-a-vis other human beings whom they consider inferior.73.	In this respect Europe is frequently judged to be privileged  because  it would appear to have a more homogeneous population and is therefore free from any racial problems. This is only partly true. Luxembourg  for instance  has within its borders a foreign population by birth amounting to 30 per cent of its own population. It is unquestionable that such a situation  by virtue of the differences of language  custom and habit and mores  creates genuine problems in the relations between foreign immigrants and Luxembourgers. Hence even we are perfectly capable of appreciating the difficulties which countries with multiracial populations may be confronted with  but that makes us only more convinced that these difficulties cannot be resolved except through co-operation based upon reciprocal good will and upon extensive understanding  whereas any discrimination will have only the effect of creating tension  indeed hatred  which nothing will dispel but which the slightest thing can cause to explode.74.	I am bound to add that while my comments apply  of course  to southern Africa  I condemn with the same rigor discrimination which emerges in any other country  and in particular the brutal expulsion brutal both in its conception and its execution of persons of different ethnic origins from any country in the world.75.	Over the years we have all had to contend with numerous criticisms of the United Nations  especially by the press and world public opinion  which describe our Organization in terms that are frequently less than kind.76.	Even if there is considerable exaggeration in all these assertions  we nevertheless must recognize that some of the aspects of the work of the United Nations are open to criticism  and it is of course necessary to reconsider the procedures  which are sometimes too slow or cumbersome  in order to arrive at more suitable working methods. I consider in particular that we ought to adhere more to a sound distribution of work and not introduce in technical debates questions of a political order  which  of course  all countries are keenly interested in but which should instead be discussed by highly competent persons  in a context that should be reserved for such discussions.77.	Some have expressed the opinion that the Charter  signed more than 27 years ago in San Francisco  is now obsolete and no longer constitutes a valid basis for world-wide co-operation. On the contrary  we  together with many Governments represented here  are of the opinion that the Charter  although not a perfect instrument  nevertheless remains one that is very well suited to its purposes  and while it is not something that should not remain untouchable or untouched  at this stage there is no need to make any fundamental changes in it.78.	If international co-operation in the United Nations is not always as effective as it might be  the fault  let us recognize  lies not with the Charter and this must be recalled very often but rather with the very imperfect use made of it by Member States.79.	I express the hope that the present session of the Assembly will be conducted in a climate of forthrightness and confident and dispassionate co-operation  and therefore in a climate of mutual respect  without which fruitful work cannot be done  so that we may not disappoint the just hopes of the peoples of the whole world."
"72",4329,"MAR",27,1972,"Mr. President  in calling upon you to lead the work of this session  the General Assembly has recognized in you the qualities required by such high responsibilities  which your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  carried out with competence and distinction. If that election is a tribute to your qualities and your experience  it is also a tribute paid to your country  whose fate for centuries was linked to almost all the painful changes that occurred in Europe through which its sons  generation after generation  did honor to the independence of peoples and the dignity of man.122.	It is also the consecration of the universality of our Organization  because all of the Member States without exception are entitled to assume the highest positions in it. This privilege is all the more deserved because Poland  of which you are one of the leaders  has with courage and equanimity made a signal contribution to the abatement of tension in Europe and to the strengthening of what we already call  with reason I hope  international detente.123.	It is not in order to exercise the demons of the hot war or the cold war that we like to call the present development in international relations a detente stage. Of course  the present state of the world still provides many serious reasons for concern  preoccupation and even anguish  and the road will still be long and difficult before the international community can feel that it is confidently moving towards that security and peace to which it aspires. But this evolution  timid and problematical as it may be  is already substantially changing the nature and quality of relations among the main Powers  whose antagonisms and confrontation were precisely the main source of the crisis which has marked the last 25 years. A series of events has occurred in the last two years which had been impossible to conceive of  at least not in the near future  in any analysis of the previous international situation.124.	The visit of Chancellor Brandt to Warsaw  the meetings between the leaders of the two Germanys  the Moscow summit and the ratification of the German-Soviet agreements are the most significant stages of this process which has made it possible to substitute dialog for mistrust  at least with respect to the problems of Europe  a region which was one of the most serious hotbeds of crises in the post-war period.125.	Another series of events has spread the same spirit to Asia and paved the way for making the most striking changes of our times. The restoration to People's China of all its rights and its admission to the United Nations  and the visit of President Nixon to Peking are in fact significant portents that the great Powers have realized the limits of the respective powers and have undertaken from now on progressively to normalize their relations.126.	In Asia again  the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to China and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries at one stroke changed all the political considerations to which we had become accustomed and opened a new chapter in their history and in that of all mankind. The agreement between those two countries  the one with all its potential and the other with all its power  promises Asia an international role genuinely in keeping with its size and is a primary feature in the change in the world balance. Moreover  the constant readjustment of this balance  in our view  offers the best chance of safeguarding international peace and security.127.	The non-aligned countries  which had organized themselves during the most crucial years of the cold war and held out against pressure as well as persuasion  can today be legitimately proud of having been able  through the mere force of their conviction  to set themselves aside from the influence of either block. Their principles and their action were to a very large extent important factors in the evolution of relations among the great Powers. If they rejoice in seeing that detente is emerging in one part of the world or has already become consolidated in another  they remain watchful and sometimes apprehensive of the risk that the new balance established among the great Powers might confront those Powers with the temptation of engaging in a simple reapportionment of roles  influences and interests in the various parts of the world. They want this detente to be indivisible and beneficial to the whole of the international community. In this very hall over a. full decade they have made of this a profession of faith whose defense was not always without its dangers.128.	In this connexion  I should like to pay a tribute to U Thant  who had felt and shared in this aspiration and who contributed with remarkable patience to the emergence of this new political context which brought us from the cold war to detente. I also know  Mr. Secretary-General  what esteem and trust have been reposed in you  and I am convinced that with the qualities that you possess which have long since established your reputation that you will be able to lead us from detente to peace.129.	A few minutes ago I spoke of the wish of countries such as mine to see this detente spread to all parts of the world  and despite the most natural feeling of national egoism  I have recorded Morocco's satisfaction at the emerging signs that peace is returning to some continents. But the continent of which Morocco is a part is still outside this charmed circle. The international community  which in the past quarter of a century has undertaken a deep reconsideration of the philosophies and values upon which it bases its behavior and which succeeded in changing its structure on the basis of a more tolerant ethic  still runs up against the colonial concept which  on the African continent  has assumed its most inhuman and most intolerable form since that phenomenon spread by successive waves over our continent during the last century. These foundations of colonialism  which were none the less solemnly repudiated within the framework of the new morality governing relations among peoples  still persist in Africa  where the process of decolonization which began in the 1950s has not been accelerated as we would have wished. And yet there are still nations with the most advanced civilizations which practice colonialism and others which support it  while both in the past either through their religion or their humanism have played a very important role in the changes brought about in relations among men. How are we to explain the indifference or the inertia shown by some Powers in this very Organization which sometimes  without any reason other than that of an alliance  ignore the courageous and desperate struggle of peoples aspiring to achieve their respect and dignity?130.	Aware of this immobility  if not of this helplessness  those peoples have been taking their fate into their own hands to an ever-increasing extent and have irrevocably chosen the narrow and painful road of struggle. This courage has earned them the sympathy and assistance of a large sector of the international community. But the African States in particular feel that it is their overriding duty to help and support these peoples. During the last summit meeting of the OAU  which my country had the honor of welcoming at Rabat  the member States demonstrated in the most striking terms their wide and effective support of these peoples. The liberation of Africa was the dominant theme of the meeting and practical measures were taken to ensure that the struggle will be supported wholeheartedly. But if they are determined to wage an all-out struggle because it has been forced upon them by their opponents  they know that this Organization  by reason of its Charter and its political action  could shorten that suffering. What can be the power of South Africa or Portugal which allows them to claim that they are and will remain Members of this Organization and sometimes to behave here in an arrogant fashion while they contemptuously and disdainfully ignore the innumerable resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly with the support of most of the great Powers? What is Southern Rhodesia compared to the power of Great Britain in the first instance  and of the international majority 14which has condemned its secession and the policy of brutal segregation which followed thereon.131.	It is true that the Secretary-General recently traveled to South Africa and Namibia and that he engaged in difficult talks with the Pretoria leaders. Without underestimating the positive nature of that initiative and of the new mission now being undertaken by the Secretary- General's representative for Namibia  we shall not harbor any illusions until we become convinced that because of these efforts the South African authorities will consent to engage in a dialog within the meaning of international decisions defining the legal status of that Territory  and within the terms of the resolutions clearly clearly setting out the steps for its liberation. Ambassador Escher  the representative of the Secretary-General  enjoys our confidence. I hope that he will provide us elements likely to make us less skeptical.132.	As for Portugal  which is waging a total war in three regions of Africa  it should begin by realizing that  despite the means placed at its disposal  the resistance movements in Guinea (Bissau)  as in Angola and Mozambique  have succeeded in establishing themselves in those Territories with a remarkable organization that makes it possible to associate with them all of the liberated populations in a venture that becomes more effective day by day. What indication could Portugal give us to make us understand that this country is finally ready to engage in a dialog with the United Nations which could progressively substitute politics for war? The nationalist leaders confronting it have proven their courage  their authority and their ability and are able to shoulder all their responsibilities. Africa has also clearly assumed its responsibilities: it supports their resistance  it determinedly and tirelessly pursues its political action at the international level and within this Organization. However  this same Africa which is still plagued by difficulties inherent in its rapid change and which is still confronted  both at home and abroad  with problems that are at times insurmountable  has proved at Rabat that it was capable of overcoming the problems inherent in its evolution and in the clarification of its interstate relations  just as it has shown itself able to cope with its responsibilities at the international level with the realization that it is an important factor in international life and that  for the world to feel concern for its problems  it must  in its turn  join ever more closely in the settlement of the world's affairs. These are the factors which the friends of Africa  as well as its opponents  have called the spirit of Rabat. We hope that next year this spirit will live again in another African capital.133.	But to this analysis which  at the start of this statement  I intended to be a positive one  I must add that Africa is not the only area where the situation obliges us to recognize the persistence of .tensions and dangers still threatening security and peace. It has by now become a chronic phenomenon  especially during the last five years  for this Organization to consider the situation created in the Middle East by the Israeli against several States in that region at a pace which does away with the myth of the cease-fire and brutally reminds us that the aggression is continuous and generalized. This Organization has taken a whole series of decisions  at the level of both the Security Council and the General Assembly  establishing a framework for the search for a solution aimed at eliminating the results of the aggression of 1967  and especially at evacuating the occupied Arab territories and recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestine people.134.	Numerous approaches were undertaken both within the framework of these resolutions and among the great Powers in their talks  or through the initiative of one country or another. The Arab States have constantly lent their support to these approaches and have set up no obstacles in their way. But Israel has  invariably  on one pretext or another  blocked all such action and every such initiative. It rejects the resolutions of the Security Council  it refuses to engage in any co-operation no matter how slight with the representative of the Secretary-General  it denounces agreement among the four great Powers  it even opposes the Rogers plan. What is more  while opposing any search for a just and equitable solution  it continues its attacks  on an increasingly violent scale  against Syria and Lebanon  in particular. Convinced that it can rely on the requirements of a particular combination of circumstances in the internal life of a great Power  in one single week it launched two attacks against Syria and bombed and invaded the territory of Lebanon. And when the Security Council meets to consider these deliberate aggressions  the exercise of the veto by one permanent member guarantees the absence of any Council decision against Israel.135.	It is particularly dangerous to international peace that a situation such as the one now prevailing in the Middle East should continue without being given serious attention  as if this Organization and the international conscience that it is supposed to represent had abdicated before a fait accompli carried out with inexplicable impunity. What does Israel hope for? Is it hoping that  once it is assured of this indifference and this impotence on the part of the United Nations  it could  at will  launch its aggression against any country it chooses  for which it is free to define the objective and determine the duration? Well  this is now the fact  and the vetoes in the Security Council will henceforth assure it that it can repeat these aggressions without any risk to itself.136.	On several occasions the leaders of the Arab countries directly concerned have clearly announced their readiness to support any initiative that  with full respect for existing resolutions and while preserving their dignity  would serve to set in motion a process capable of facilitating the restoration of peace to the area. After five years  this show of goodwill and patience has been put to the test and these States  conscious of their responsibilities to their own peoples find themselves constrained to resort more and more to other possibilities that certainly do not bring peace any closer.137.	This situation was vigorously denounced this year by all of the African States meeting in June at Rabat  and by the 62 non-aligned countries meeting in August at Georgetown. The persistence of the crisis and its unforeseeable future course can be laid only at the door of Israel and those members of the international community whose indifference is interpreted by Israel as tacit encouragement. In the face of such a clear-cut situation there can be no alibi. Especially not the alibi called terrorism.138.	We do not hesitate to declare solemnly that we are opposed to all forms of violence  that blood shed by violence must be deplored  whatever the nationality  the race or the religion of the victim. For several decades we in fact have always been on the side of the victim of violence rather than on that of its perpetrators. And if today the explosive power of certain words is deliberately being intensified  it is exclusively for the purpose of adjusting them to their intended use. First of all  what is terrorism? We exclude from the definition that people are now trying to work out any act motivated by the defense of a legitimate and inalienable right which the law has failed to protect. This principle  in our view  applies as much as to an individual as to a group and  a fortiori  to an entire people. An objectively violent act  may have legitimate motivations and  speaking of the actions of Palestinians  let us clearly say that this involves the expression of one of the most painful aspects of the crisis in the Middle East  namely  that where there is aggression there is necessarily resistance.139.	The Palestine people was coldly and cynically abandoned in 1948; half of that people remained as hostage to those occupying its country; half was driven from its houses  its lands  beyond its border  to yield its place to foreigners coming from every corner of the globe. That people for a long time hoped that those supposedly assisting it would help in the recovery of its homeland and its dignity. The Arab countries for 25 years have tried to denounce the flagrant injustice committed against their people with the blessing of those who today criticize them. They have failed so far. But a new generation  raised in frustration  often in poverty  has  on coming of age  at least regained the moral and unalterable inheritance of which nothing can deprive a great people: its dignity. To express this thirst for justice and dignity it has tried the only ways and means which the political order existing in the world has left at its disposal. These were ineffectual  since its rights continued to be ignored. This international community  from which it sought justice  apparently did not understand its despair and its cry for help  while like all people in history  it used the sublime recourse which is the gift of life itself to remind the world of its existence. There is no need to seek elsewhere  other than to understand the actions of the sons of this lost Palestine.140.	That truth  which we painfully feel and which we express with the utmost regret  is also useful in our opinion to the search for a true peace in this area  a vital part of the Mediterranean basin. And  we  at the opposite end of the Mediterranean are trying to work out and agree  with our neighbors of the south and the north  on the basis for a co-operation likely to ensure to all of us permanent security and prosperity. The Maghreb  if it has not yet succeeded  is progressing happily with confidence in and respect for that unity which is the deep aspiration of all its peoples.141.	On the shores of Europe  the Common Market is expanding and Europe is working on a political unity which we think could be a positive factor in the stability which Europe has been seeking since the end of the war  the stability necessary to ensure to it its rightful role in the world. Linked by history  convinced of the similarity of our interests and desirous to the same extent of avoiding falling under the hegemony of the great Powers  we are formulating together the hope of finding around this sea sufficient motivation to strengthen our ties in a solid and lasting way.142.	We rejoice in the possibility  which we hope will come about very soon  of a conference on European security. The peoples of Europe  who throughout history have often had a common destiny  can reasonably expect today to build together a world in which they will recover their true vocation and their common hope. If we greet this conference with joy  we also think that European security would be incomplete and fragile without security for the Mediterranean and for all the peoples living along its shores. That is why we are most interested in having our problems taken into consideration at that conference.143.	If Europe thinks that the Rhine or the Elbe are the axes of its destiny  we believe equally strongly that the Mediterranean is ours  and that we are seriously concerned about this. In Morocco we are gratified by the relationships we maintain with all the countries of the northern coast. There are so many affinities and so many interests binding us together that our will co co-operate with them is an inevitable element in our destiny. I should like to say especially to one of those countries with which we have had a kind of centuries-old historical intimacy  that we are aware of the fact that our positions in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean could in future lead us to establishing closer co-operation then in the past; and while the reservoir of friendship accumulated during that common history is an important factor in any calm consideration of such cooperation  I must say just as frankly that the road towards this common action must be cleared of anything that might give rise to conflicts and misunderstandings.144.	The rather serious dispute which existed between us and Spain has appreciably lightened in recent years  but it still involves fundamental divergences which continue to be a source of concern. I have in mind the problem of the Sahara. The desire to preserve the potential benefits of the future has consistently led us to seek in frank and loyal dialog a solution which would redress the consequences of past phenomena which are no longer valid in our present day world  and which Spain has from this very rostrum strongly condemned when it claimed the legitimate return of Gibraltar to its national territory. We have carried forward a dialog for many years and action at United Nations level in which Spain is no longer facilitating our progress towards a solution  as it did in the past in accordance with our admission.145.	True friends know how to overcome quarrels. Both sides must also be aware of their duty not to sacrifice such important prospects for co-operation to misunderstandings which in the long-run may imperil the deepest friendship."
"73",4425,"MDG",27,1972,"A country proud of its past  of its customs and of its traditions  a nation working in the challenging task struggling against under-development  injustice and poverty  a people  finally  determined to affirm its identity  its personality and its sovereignty when confronting the future: such is the Malagasy Republic in October 1972.81.	I  who have the honor today of speaking for the first time on behalf of that Republic  address to the President its sincere congratulations on his election to preside over this twenty-seventh session of our General Assembly. I am convinced that  thanks to his eminent qualities as a politician  diplomat and specialist in international affairs  the work of this session of the Assembly will take place in a calm atmosphere  will bear the hallmark of objectivity and will be crowned by the success that the peoples of the entire world with deep hope expect of it.82.	I am very happy to stress the remarkable and able mastery with which the President's predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  presided over the work of the twenty-sixth session.83.	I am very happy also to be able to pay a solemn tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his efforts  carried out with'' patience and courage  to confront with determination all the intricate problems that face the international community.84.	The Malagasy Republic wishes to do its small part and to make its modest contribution to the great common three-fold goal: peace  fraternity and international justice. It is for that reason that  despite our remoteness and insularity  we are determined to keep in touch with the world and to have our voice heard on all current problems.85.	Thus we  the people of the Malagasy Republic  welcome agreement and reconciliation here and the relaxation of tension and normalization there. We are extremely happy  first of all  at the entry into force of the treaties signed between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and between the latter and Poland. We are also gratified at the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin and at the economic opening of the German Democratic Republic to the other European nations.86.	We are also gratified at the ratification of the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan in August 1972. Finally we are gratified at the opening of direct talks between the two parts of Korea  which  we hope  will lead very soon to the reunification of the country.87.	In particular we welcome the forthcoming conference on European security  and the signing on 3 October of the documents dealing with the entry into force of the agreements on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. 88.	We note with satisfaction the recent movement of international relations towards the emergence of a multi-polar system capable  we believe  of encouraging greater interdependence in relations among States  non-alignment and  finally  negotiations and positive bilateral agreements.89.	Finally  we wish to pay a warm tribute to the spirit of Rabat  which allowed the African countries to set aside what divides them and devote themselves fully to what unites them  and thus to concentrate their efforts on common action to ensure unity  liberty and peace. We earnestly hope that this same spirit of Rabat will make it possible rapidly to solve the present dispute between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.90.	But unfortunately we must recognize that these few bright patches are not sufficient to remove the clouds from the skies of international relations  where storms still break out here and there  while heavy cumulo-nimbus clouds still darken the horizon  particularly of the third  world the beleaguered third world  where aggression is committed here and there  while the clash of rival ideologies and ambitions still causes far-off conflicts that are as murderous as they are deplorable.91.	Thus  in Viet-Nam the blind bombing of civilian targets and populations continues relentlessly without justification. More than a quarter of a century of war has proved  if we needed proof  that a military solution to this conflict is most improbable and that it is up to the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese alone to find a negotiated  just  equitable and lastL solution  without foreign interference. That is the essential condition without which  we believe  the Vietnamese people cannot live in peace  and certainly not in peace with independence and dignity. Only the neutralization of South-East Asia can restore peace to that region.92.	In the Middle East  our position regarding the long-standing conflict which afflicts that area is  again  dictated by realism  justice and respect for equal rights. We believe that one would have to be very naive today to say that Israel could be purely and simply wiped from the map of the world. Israel is a reality. It is a regrettable fait accompli in the sense that it was practically imposed on the international community by the great Powers of the time. But  all the same  it is a fait accompli. On the other hand  what we categorically refuse to accept is that Israel should go from one fait accompli to another and conduct itself with impunity as an expansionist  imperialist and war-like Power. As a member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] we refuse to agree that a foreign State can occupy by force the territory of another State and in particular of an African State  Egypt  trampling underfoot at one and the same time the inalienable right to existence and self-determination of the Palestinian people.93.	That is why we forcefully reiterate our unreserved support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967) calling upon Israel to withdraw from the territories that it improperly occupied after the famous six-day war. In the present state of affairs that is the only way that will lead to a peaceful  just and equitable settlement of the conflict. If that thorny question is not solved  if the roots of the evil are not attacked  it is obvious that all the efforts we might decide to make against certain desperate acts of terrorism  however deplorable they may be  will be in vain.94.	Another subject for mitigated satisfaction is the question of disarmament. While we note with satisfaction the Moscow Agreement of 26 May 1972 on the limitation of strategic offensive arms  it still is a fact that a limitation on the installation of anti-ballistic missiles and the establishment of a numerical ceiling for offensive missiles should have been accompanied by a concomitant limitation on the qualitative increase in the nuclear arsenals of the superPowers. In other words  we whole-heartedly insist upon the need to sign as soon as possible a convention on chemical and biological weapons and on the urgent need for general and complete disarmament. We also advocate the holding of a world conference on disarmament  the main objective of which would be the destruction of all nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass annihilation.95.	Regarding the difficult problem of development  we believe the achievement of a harmonious and equitable development of world economy to be indispensable  as also the establishment of a new economic and social order that will meet the needs of all nations and all peoples.96.	But  alas  we still fall into a certain skepticism if we objectively analyze the world economic situation. The growth rate of the so-called developing nations falls far short of the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade. The deterioration in terms of trade also causes disquiet to the countries of the third world. And  finally  the third session of UNCTAD unfortunately did not live up to the hopes that the 77-now the 96-developing countries placed in it after the Declaration of Lima. 97.	Under-development is not just a delay in development; it is the unavoidable consequence of a one-sided approach to the organization of world trade which favors a minority at the expense of the great majority. The balance-or should I say the imbalance that has been established between the developed and the non-developed countries is deeply unjust and wrong. The poor constantly sell at lower prices and purchase at higher prices from the wealthy.98.	The self-centered economies of the industrialized countries have long seen their products appreciate in value  which allows them further to develop  to the detriment of the peripheral non-self-reliant economies of the needy countries. But that appreciation has gone so far that it must not be allowed to last indefinitely. Therefore  it is imperative that the under-developed nations form a common front in the international community confronting the wealthy countries  if only to ensure proper rates for their raw materials.99.	The logical corollary of the problem of development that is  the problem of decolonization and human rights cannot fail to be a subject of great concern to a proletarian nation such as Madagascar. Saint-Exupery told us  ""Respect for man  respect for man: that is the touchstone! "" But if respect for man lies in the hearts of men  then men will eventually ensure a social  political and economic system that enshrines that respect.100.	The tie between development and decolonization would seem to be obvious  since both rest on respect for and recognition of the rights of peoples. Colonialism  racism  the denial of human rights these are the main obstacles to the development of any man and of the whole man.101.	Respect for man and the sovereignty of peoples  recognition of the interests and rights of the indigenous inhabitants  respect for democracy  the rights of self- determination  freedom and justice all are leitmotivs that should continue to receive priority today even though they are somewhat tarnished in the midst of the contradictions that gnaw at the very basis of our civilization. That those conditions are far from achieved in Africa is an obvious fact. That is why we of the Malagasy Republic reaffirm as loudly as ever the following points: first  that Namibia must be liberated from the illegal presence of South Africa  in accordance with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 21 June 1971 ;  secondly  that Southern Rhodesia should be cleared of the oppression of the white minority of Ian Smith; thirdly  that a new Constitution should be drawn up to replace that of 1969  which has been recognized by neither the United Nations nor the Administering Authority; and fourthly that the sham blockade of Rhodesia should cease immediately. That is one of the reasons why the Malagasy Republic put an end to a so-called ""blockade air force"" based in Majunga. An effective blockade must be set up or the present blockade  which is nothing but a joke  should be ended. Thirdly  the perpetuation of Portuguese domination in West and East Africa gravely threatens international peace and stability in the region.102.	The right to self-determination of these Non-Self- Governing Territories must be recognized and respected  and efforts to carry out indirect recolonization must be denounced and rejected in particular  the placing of more than 1 million expatriate settlers in Mozambique and Angola in order to build the Cabora Bassa and Cunene dams.103.	We cannot end these brief considerations on the decolonization of peoples without drawing the attention of this distinguished gathering to certain improper interpretations and also certain oversimplifications confusing gratuitous terrorism with the struggle for national liberation  particularly in Africa. While we condemn senseless and blind terrorism  we support and encourage the just struggle of the national liberation movements. In desperation  the colonized peoples have no alternative but to resort to violence in order to cut the Gordian knot that binds them.104.	What  finally  are we to say about apartheid  that scourge of the twentieth century that still defies public opinion? All nations that love peace and justice must resolutely fight together to eliminate this crime against mankind from our planet for ever. We  for our part  honestly believe that we have fought effectively against apartheid by cutting off all dialog with South Africa. Paradoxically  that seems to suit both sides-both those who support and those who attack the dialog policy. We have served the supporters of dialog by showing the vanity of that policy as conceived  noting that the Pretoria regime has not changed its policy of apartheid one iota  and proving that no concession has been made in favor of the blacks of South Africa. That might have led Mr. Vorster to modify his position if he wanted to interest certain countries of Africa in dialog.105.	But we feel we have strengthened even further the camp of intransigent adversaries of racial segregation by proving that in the more-and-more threadbare guise of dialog the segregationists of Pretoria have only endeavored to divide the Africans and to find customers ready to condone their imperialist and racist policies. Therefore  by that historic and twofold decision  we are convinced that we have served the cause of justice  fraternity and freedom.106.	Obviously  some who still dream of the absurd and distant past have tried to discourage us by waving the specter of bankruptcy before us. Some have in fact tried to blackmail us by using measures of extortion such as sabotage or the abandonment of an economic project that might have greatly helped to promote the economic development of our country. We shall answer them resolutely and in this we shall be accompanied by the voice of the entire Malagasy people that regardless of what happens we shall not go to Canossa.107.	We would prefer to give up such a grandiose and profitable investment if it would mean increasing our dependence upon foreigners if the price must be the relinquishment of our sovereignty and national dignity.108.	In conclusion  I shall merely state that all the peoples of the world aspire to development  to better living conditions  to justice and to peace.109.	But to attain these noble aims the unity and the solidarity of all are more than ever necessary. Concerted and united efforts on the part of one and all are more than ever essential. All nations-whether large  medium or small must make a positive contribution to the maintenance of peace and to the settlement of the important interrelated problems of the moment: development  decolonization  human rights  disarmament and peaceful coexistence  among others.110.	We in Madagascar wish to state solemnly in this forum that  after more than 80 years of abdication and eclipse  Madagascar is now enjoying a renaissance and from now on intends fully to play its rightful role in our part of the Indian Ocean. We have put an end to 12 years of mistrust  diffidence and lack of understanding regarding certain socialist and progressive countries by establishing with all these countries  whether from the East or the West  relations of a dispassionate nature based on mutual respect  a clear understanding of our common interests and the five principles of peaceful coexistence.111.	And we trust that we shall be able to progress with our sincere and forthright policies because this is the most pragmatic form of pragmatism and the most realistic form of realism.112.	We are  in one word  convinced that humanism  in the fullest sense accepted and desired by all  is the sole foundation for peace  justice and the democratization of international relations.113.	With this in mind  we are no less convinced that under your guidance  Mr. President  the work of this session of the Assembly will attain the objectives set for it.114.	May I conclude by assuring you  Mr. President  that in that task the collaboration and the understanding of the Malagasy Republic are entirely at your disposal. We wish to thank you for hearing us with patience. "
"74",4508,"MEX",27,1972,"History shows that man cannot and should not live alone. Accordingly  since the most remote times of history up until the present day he has persistently tried to become integrated with and to seek a full measure of development within various social nuclei. These efforts were manifested  first  within the family the essential cell of any human community  then within the tribe  later in towns and finally within the State  which is the most comprehensive social organization.67.	Neither can States live alone. They need to join with others for progress and mutual protection. Although sometimes imperfect and at other times not a complete success  interstate association is required if human beings are to coexist in today's world. That explains why the establishment of the United Nations was not merely a reflection of a feeling of brotherhood but was rather the satisfaction of a great need to develop the international community.68.	The elimination of any act designed to stand in the way of the true union of States is a continuing task to which this world Organization must devote its best efforts. Accordingly  war or ambition for hegemony  as well as economic domination by those with material power  when exercised to the detriment of the fair development of the materially weak  are disturbing elements which must be removed.69.	Freedom  for which millions of human beings have laid down their lives in the course of history  of necessity implies strict respect for human dignity and faithful observance of the legal equality of States. Accordingly  we should always try in our work to ensure that these basic tenets of the San Francisco Charter become general rules which are put into practice and are universally observed.70.	Mr. President  we know that you were elected because of your impartiality and efficiency  which you have displayed on more than one occasion in your conduct of our debates. We offer you sincere congratulations.71.	I should like to convey to the Secretary-General  in addition to our high esteem for his meritorious efforts  the gratitude of my country for having appointed a distinguished Mexican  Mr. Antonio Carrillo Flores  as Secretary- General of the United Nations World Population Conference  which is scheduled to be held in 1974. The population explosion is already a problem which it is urgent to solve and it is a fact of life which commands our utmost attention. As it is a multifaceted issue which has an impact in the educational  political  social and economic fields  it requires the broadest possible approach  subject always to the policy and program which all our peoples have adopted in the exercise of their sovereignty.72.	Whenever we come together we must  albeit briefly  review the most salient international developments. This year the situation in Central Europe has stabilized  and the efforts of the two largest world Powers to normalize  consolidate and strengthen their relations in all areas have begun to yield gratifying results. It might be said that their mere coexistence  based on a respective capacity for nuclear deterrence  is tending to be transformed into active co-operation between these Powers.73.	We should all welcome the understandings reached  particularly when they diminish the risks of a nuclear confrontation which would engulf mankind. None the less  there are clouds on the horizon if we look in the direction of the third world.74.	The absurd desire to divide the earth into zones of influence or hegemony is not the best approach to international coexistence. Thus  despite ideological divergences among the great Powers  upon occasion' there has emerged a certain identity or at least a similarity of interests with respect to their positions vis-a-vis the third world. When this has occurred their common stand tends to preserve the status quo  which certainly has not proved to be favorable to the non-aligned countries. Thus  during the last few years we have noticed a decline in the financial assistance provided by these Powers to the developing countries. In other areas the positions of these great Powers have also come so close together that they nearly represent a common front vis-a-vis the majority of the countries of the third world; this occurs with respect to the law of the sea and disarmament  where they have only looked after their own interests and have frequently paid little heed to the wishes of almost all other States.75.	As the President of Mexico so aptly put it in addressing the United States Congress recently  we cannot reduce world policy to contacts between the powerful countries  since anything that affects those countries in the final analysis affects all of us. Genuine universal peace  in addition to an understanding between the powerful States  requires the active participation by all members of the international community in a strengthened system of collective security. Accordingly  we believe that we should improve and institutionalize the representation of the third world in international political organs. Later in this statement we will give our ideas on that subject.76.	With respect to continuing efforts within the United Nations to halt the nuclear arms race and to eliminate other weapons of mass destruction  the balance sheet for 1972 could not be more discouraging. As clearly emerges from the last report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament [A/8818]  that body in its most recent meetings did not achieve the slightest bit of progress on any of the items it was dealing with.77.	The bogging down of work to bring about the total elimination of chemical weapons  which was the subject of three General Assembly resolutions at its last session  is doubly regrettable  as it may jeopardize the convention that had already been agreed upon for the elimination of biological weapons.78.	A similar situation exists with respect to nuclear weapon tests which  on the initiative of the Mexican delegation  th<; General Assembly once again last year emphatically and unreservedly condemned for the second time [resolution 2828 A (XXVI)]. However  not only have such practices continued  but there has been an increase in underground testing  a situation which  apart from endangering the health of present and future generations  will inevitably lead  if those tests are continued  to the crumbling of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  which was concluded only after arduous efforts.79.	The negative results of the work done in Geneva confirm our belief that we must without delay strengthen the system which the United Nations has to fulfil the obligations entrusted to it under the Charter in the field of disarmament. It would appear necessary for both the negotiating body  with its headquarters at Geneva  and the other deliberative bodies available to the United Nations for disarmament to be substantially strengthened and their performance brought into line with the basic principle of the sovereign equality of States.80.	We should as a matter of urgency begin preparatory work on the convening of the World Disarmament Conference wherein all peoples and Governments will have an appropriate forum  a rostrum from which the voices of reason  anguish  impatience and indignation can be heard.81.	It is encouraging that there has been no break in the growth of the nuclear free zone established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). During the current year the number of States parties to the Treaty has risen to 18 as a result of the ratification deposited by Colombia. The Latin American nuclear-free zone today covers an area of some 8 million square kilometers and has a population in excess of 140 million people. With respect to Additional Protocol II to the Treaty  the purpose of which is to ensure that the Treaty's provisions should be fully respected by the nuclear Powers  it would appear appropriate to recall that in the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of Mexico and the People's Republic of China [see A/8818  annex 13  sect. 2]  the latter Government stated that it supported the just position of Mexico and other Latin American States on the establishment of a Latin American nuclear-free zone and that all States possessing such weapons should assume the obligation not to employ them against the Latin American States. We interpret that statement as a promising sign that we can look forward to the valuable co-operation in the near future of the People's Republic of China with the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which would be signified by its signing and ratifying Additional Protocol II  a position which we believe should also be taken by other States which possess nuclear weapons but which have not yet subscribed to that document.82.	In Mexico City the work of the sixteenth session of The General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency  which began last 26 September  will come to a close very shortly. My country has had the honor to be the host of that Conference  which has considered items of great concern to all mankind. At that Conference Mexico has reiterated its deep interest in having the constant progress of nuclear science help to improve our standards of living and not contribute to the production of weapons which threaten our very existence. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is and will continue to be the constant goal of Mexico. As was so well said by President Echeverria in his opening speech at the Conference  we believe that the word ""atom"" should not be linked to the idea of death  but to the idea of a power capable of improving the conditions of human life.83.	The Secretary-General expressed his concern over the use of means of warfare which have particularly cruel  devastating and indiscriminate effects  when he emphasized in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the moral responsibility which he bears ""does not allow him to turn a blind eye when innocent civilian lives are placed in jeopardy on a large scale"" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 4].84.	Mexico entirely agrees with that position. Accordingly  it was one of the first to offer its modest co-' operation through the appointment of a Mexican governmental adviser to help prepare the report which the General Assembly requested of the Secretary-General in its resolution 2852 (XXVI) [A/8781 and Corr.l]  which was intended  as the title indicates  to promote respect for human rights during armed conflicts  and in which the Assembly emphasized its deep concern over the ""terrible suffering that armed conflicts continue to inflict upon combatants and civilians  particularly through the use of cruel means and methods of warfare and through inadequate restraints in defining military objectives"". We trust that that report  which the Assembly will b: considering at its current session  will contribute to the realization of that noble and pressing objective.85.	It seems appropriate to us that the item on international terrorism should have been included on the agenda of this session [item 92]. Barbarous acts like these merit punishment and the condemnation of all peoples  regardless of the ideological system under which one attempts to conceal them.86.	In 1970 Mexico defined terrorist acts in its penal laws. Furthermore  within the system of the Organization of American States  we attended in February 1971 a meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization which had been convened in Washington for that very purpose  and we signed the final document adopted by the Council.87.	Despite our determination to repress acts which are in themselves abominable  we stated then  and we should like to repeat now  our concern to ensure that the instruments on this question that are prepared should not infringe or limit in any way the right of territorial or diplomatic asylum  which is so deeply rooted in the traditions of the countries of Latin America. It is also necessary that the definition of terrorism should be worked out with the utmost caution  in order to avoid its serving as a pretext to restrict or suppress individual freedoms or to limit the exercise of the right of self-determination of those peoples which are still subject to colonialism. Lastly  it seems essential to us that the determination of terrorist acts should always be the responsibility of the State in whose territory those acts have occurred  inasmuch as only in this way can we avoid violations of the State's sovereignty. On those conditions  we are prepared to enter into a dialog in this international forum and provide our unstinting co-operation in a study of measures that appear advisable to bring about the elimination of international terrorism.88.	We are still convinced that one of the fundamental tasks of the United Nations continues to be the proper and complete application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. It is incredible  in the opinion of my country  that in this space age in which we live  we should still be debating this item and placing it exclusively within a political framework  which has long since been superseded  as indeed it should be; it is high time that we now deal with the other form of colonialism which is equally ominous  and I refer to economic colonialism.89.	Absolute decolonization  in accordance with the United Nations Declaration  solemnly proclaimed in 1960  and the elimination of the remnants of colonialism in all of its forms and manifestations are essential prerequisites if developing States are to be able fully to exercise their economic rights in the international arena.90.	The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of NationalJurisdiction has made progress which in our opinion gives grounds for the hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea may start on the substantive portion of its work in 1974. Indeed  after two years of arduous and sometimes frustrating negotiations  the list of topics and issues to serve as the framework of the study and approval of the various articles to be induced in the instrument or instruments to be adopted by the Conference was finally adopted.91. With respect to the priorities that should be assigned to the consideration of the items  it would be well to make an effort to reconcile the various approaches that have been expressed on this point  starting from the fact-which is already obvious at this stage-that :t will be necessary to preserve and always bear in mind the unity of the various branches of law which come under the law of the sea. If this premise is accepted  it seems to us that we could easily avoid the procedural obstacle of discussing a pre-established order for the presentation of proposals on any of the topics and issues included in the list already approved.  92. Apart from the concept  which is steadily gaining ground  of a 12-mile-wide territorial sea  Mexico recently 'spoke out in favor of the universal recognition of the coastal State's right to exercise jurisdiction over a zone whose maximum width should not exceed 200 miles. In that zone  for which we are in favor of the term ""patrimonial sea""  the coastal State would be entitled to exploit and explore resources for the benefit of its people  without this signifying that we are thinking of establishing limitations on the laying of under-water cables  navigation or over-flight by other States.93.	Last June we participated  together with other countries of the Caribbean region  in the Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea  convened by the Government of the Dominican Republic. There we supported and clearly defined the characteristic features which  in our opinion  should be contained in the thesis of the patrimonial sea. The Declaration of Santo Domingo [A/8721  annex I sect. 2] took up this theory  which we very much hope will eventually become  after the changes and additions to be agreed upon by common accord  a formula encompassing all of the States of Latin America.94.	Unquestionably  one of the most important international events which have occurred under the auspices of the United Nations was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  which took place in the capital of Sweden also in June of this year. The preservation of the human environment is the responsibility of all States. Those that because of their degree of development have contributed the most to the deterioration of the environment should assume greater technical and financial responsibilities for the establishment of corrective machinery.95.	Thus  it is the duty of all States to see to it that pollution caused by activities within their jurisdiction or under their control should not go beyond national boundaries  and also to provide compensation for the damage caused  Mexico has been the victim of non-compliance with this equitable and common-sensical rule  which should be accepted by all on a bilateral as well as multilateral basis.96.	No policy for the preservation of the human environment adopted by the international community should impede the development effort of the non-industrialized countries.97.	In our opinion  the foregoing should appear first and among the fundamental rules which we hope will be adopted at the second United Nations conference on the human environment  which we would hope would be convened in 1975  with the active participation of all States. Because of the benefits of such a conference for mankind and because of the importance that my country attributes to the protection of the national environment  as is shown by the especially significant legislative and practical measures it has adopted to prevent pollution  Mexico has announced that it would be pleased to have the second conference held in our capital. We repeat now this cordial and sincere invitation.98.	As is well known  a great deal of the extraordinary economic and social progress registered in recent decades is the result of advances in science and  more specifically  the application of scientific knowledge to technology investments and  in general  production processes. However  every day the gap between the technological achievements of the more advanced and the less developed countries is growing.99.	Accordingly  the developed countries are duty bound to support without reservation the preparation of an international program designed to promote the transfer of appropriate technology to *he developing countries including  inter alia  the revision of international agreements on patents  the conclusion of agreements or conventions required to facilitate  in permanent and favorable conditions  the access of developing countries to patented and non-patented technology and the adaption of measures designed to promote those countries own technology.100.	At the outset of this statement we expressed our conviction that we should improve and institutionalize the participation of the third world in the system of collective security of the Unite ' Nations  and we would venture to put forward now a few specific ideas on this point.101.	Ever since 1945  when our Organization was created at the San Francisco Conference  Mexico has advanced serious reservations on the system adopted for the membership and the voting procedure of the Security Council  that organ to which the Charter has entrusted primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Since the amendment which we proposed at that time in the appropriate Committee of the Conference  was not adopted  Mexico stated for the record that it had decided to accept the text of Article 23 of the Charter because it interpreted that Article as an implicit application of the rule of law that there is a connection between powers and obligations which leaves intact the basic principles of the equal rights of all States.  102.	No delegation came forward to object to this interpretation of ours  which  for that matter  had a solid foundation in numerous official declarations made by the Heads of State of the Powers that participated in the Dumbarton Oaks talks. Thus  we wish now to propose in this forum that we should include in the Security Council at least one representative of the third world with the status of a permanent member of the Council and given the same powers as are enjoyed by the five permanent members now on the Council.103.	Our proposal has the same logical  legal and political basis which we expounded in San Francisco in explaining our acceptance of the privileged position that the five permanent members of the Council have been enjoying through the years. We think that since that time a new fact has emerged which would more than justify the idea that we should immediately accept this proposal  that is  the emergence of a third world  which was practically nonexistent in San Francisco but which today makes up the largest group of States Members of our Organization. If  taken in isolation  the countries of the third world cannot hope to be counted either among the most wealthy or the most powerful  taken together they represent  beyond question  one of the most forceful elements in the United Nations. It is t!iis moral force—this force which they have by virtue of being spokesmen for about two thirds of the world's population and frequently the champions of the principles of the Charter-which gives us grounds for asserting that they have a capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace equal to or even greater than that of some of the States that have been sitting as permanent members. That is why  I repeat  we are convinced that it would be entirely just and  furthermore  of great benefit to the Organization if the third world had a permanent representative in the Security Council.104.	Peace is not merely the absence of war; it is rather the implementation of measures necessary for the socioeconomic progress of nations. Peace will not be complete as long as some live in abundance and many others subsist in poverty. Peace is one of the natural consequences of the exercise of freedom  at all levels and in all realms. However  as was already said by a famous English liberal: ""Liberty is subject to control  and he who controls conditions controls freedom."" In our times  as long as some have a monopoly on the world's economic elements  they will control in varying degrees the freedom of the rest.105.	An examination of the world economic situation shows definitely that the policy of the developed countries is departing every day more and more from the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)}. International co-operation has reached its lowest point since the United Nations was established  and the growing social and economic abyss that divides the developed from the developing States poses today one of the most serious threats to world peace. The alarming picture that we are confronted with makes it of pressing urgency to ensure that the principle of the juridical equality of States ceases to be a Utopian arrangement devoid of any real content and that international economic co-operation should not be viewed in terms of goodwill but should rather enter fully into the field of law so that the prevalent inequality in the world may be diminished and we can bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth.106.	That is why the President of Mexico proposed  during the third session of UNCTAD  that there should be drawn up a charter of the economic rights and duties of States which would be complementary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and an appropriate means for bringing about an atmosphere of social equity which would promote the full flowering of all human beings. 107.	The development of nations is both a duty and a right  and access to the benefits of scientific progress  the application of technology  the development of natural resources and the promotion of foreign trade and financial co-operation are continuing prerogatives of mankind. All States are in duty bound to carry out a foreign and domestic policy designed to accelerate the balanced economic growth of the world as a whole and  in particular  to foster in the developing countries a rate of growth consistent with the need to achieve a substantial and continuing increase in the average income  in order to reduce the vast difference which exists between the standard of living in the developing countries and that obtaining in the developed countries and to create an atmosphere which will guarantee social justice. The developed countries will have to apply to the developing countries generalized  non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory preferential treatment with respect to all goods which may be objects of trade.108.	We should draw a precise distinction between those natural resources  be they on land or in the sea  which belong to a State and which that State therefore enjoys the sovereign right to make free use of in order to promote the economic development and well-being of its people and those resources which constitute the common heritage of mankind  be they in the sea or in outer space  the exploration and exploitation of which should be carried out for the benefit of mankind.109.	I have set forth some of the key ideas which  in the opinion of my country  should govern economic relations among States. We are gratified that Mexico's initiative has met with enthusiastic support from the developing countries and is also supported by some highly developed and industrialized countries. We have already established the procedures that should be followed in the elaboration of the draft charter of the economic rights and duties of States  which we hope can be submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly at its next session.110.	A document of universal legal validity such as the one Mexico has suggested to the community of nations will test the readiness of the powerful countries to put into practice true international solidarity which  resting on the principles of the sovereign equality of States  non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples  and governed by binding legal rules  could become the best instrument to achieve and consolidate stable and lasting peace.111.	As we have already stated  neither man nor the State can live alone.112.	Without further delay we must end the arms race. We must severely punish those who use human lives as a means of political extortion. We must put an end to colonialism  draw up regulations for the equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea  improve our environment  and use science and technology for the harmonious development of all peoples. We must provide permanent representation for the third world in the maintenance of peace and security. We must reduce the vast gap between the overwhelmingly wealthy and the bitterly poor by adopting a rule of general application clearly establishing the economic rights and duties of States.113.	Unless these tasks are fulfilled our planet earth will be converted into a piece of the cosmos pursuing its eternal course forever in solitude."
"75",4603,"MLI",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I be permitted first to express to you the warm congratulations of my delegation on your brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. These congratulations go equally to all the other members of the General Committee.2.	This tribute  which is paid to your country through you as evidence of its attachment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter  is a matter of gratification to us particularly since our two peoples and Governments maintain extremely friendly relations.3.	We are convinced from the very outset that  through your distinguished qualities and your great experience in international life  the work of the present session will be conducted with wisdom and skill.4.	Furthermore  I should like to take advantage of this pleasant occasion to thank very sincerely the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  who conducted so well the work of the last session.5.	Our acceptance of the Charter of the United Nations implies for all our States an obligation of loyalty to its principles and its ideals. Consequently  it is our duty to join our efforts in order to bring about a world of peace and justice in which the negative forces of hatred and domination will give way to those of understanding and comprehension among peoples  based on the respect of our individual characteristics.6.	Last year I had an opportunity to dwell on certain of the positive aspects of our joint action. However  at the same time  I had occasion to speak out against the persistence of colonialism  the principle of settling conflicts by sheer armed force and the organization of human society on the basis of racial or religious differences. At that time I also deplored the reluctance shown by the international community to meet the elementary needs of the majority of the world's population.7.	If we wish to respond to the profound aspirations of our peoples  we must promptly eliminate from our practices those principles which run counter to international ethics and at the same time we must strengthen the universal nature of our Organization.8.	Undoubtedly history will remember the political courage with which we have honored the Charter and thus put an end to the conflict caused in our consciences by restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Encouraged by that victory  the international Organization will justly be able to create other opportunities for redress of this sort so that in coming years the voice of all peoples can be heard in this hall in the same fraternal spirit.9.	The opening of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly is marked by a series of noteworthy events.10.	Europe which  twice in less than a generation  has seen the outbreak of conflagrations which have sorely tried humanity  is preparing for a conference on its security and economic integration. The Treaty on Questions relating to Surface Transport  which was concluded between the two Germanys  on 25 May 1972  in our view constitutes an encouraging sign of a reconciliation between those two States. The ratification by the Bundestag  on 17 May 1972  of the Treaties concluded firstly between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and  secondly  between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland  leads us to believe that the desire to work for peace and international security has definitely triumphed over mistrust and suspicion.11.	Undoubtedly  the threat of what philosophers have called our ""cosmic suicide"" still exists. Our horizon is not yet totally free of the atomic clouds which have darkened it since the end of the Second World War. Although it is unreasonable to draw any final conclusion about arrangements whose nature is not yet known to us entirely  we would note  as an important contribution to detente  the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  which was concluded at Moscow on 26 May 1972 between the Government of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The arms race has not stopped nor has it slackened either in the Soviet Union or the United States. These agreements  however  serve as an example; and unless there is a misconception as to the role which each of these States must play in the harmonious evolution of international relations  they will have opened up the way to other forms of agreement and to the possibility of using atomic power for the benefit of mankind.12.	Our constant concern to abide by the noble ideals of the Charter and to preserve mankind from the scourge of war has led us during the past session to adopt the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [see resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex]  which 169 States signed on 10 April 1972 in Moscow  London and Washington.13.	This series of important events proves that a minimum of political far-sightedness can lead to results which bring us closer to the ideals of the Charter  to which  as I said  we have all freely subscribed. We need only refer to the holding of meetings of the Security Council in Africa and the important decisions taken by the ninth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of Africa Unity [OAU]  held at Rabat in February 1972  and the last Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Georgetown. Guyana  in August 1972.14.	The improvement of international relations  which is the bounden duty of each of our States  is one of the major concerns of the present day world. The division of the world into two antagonistic blocs seems to be giving way to a certain multi-polarity  which may lead us progressively to democratize relations among States. Unfortunately  this encouraging turn of events has been marred by reactions which have been dictated either by false concepts of national honor or by philosophies and policies that are backward and dangerous because they attack the fundamental values of human civilization.15.	This explains why the Government of the Republic of Mali was indignant at the deterioration of the situation in the Indochina peninsula; why we refuse to sanction the law of the force of arms in the settlement of disputes among States; and  finally  why we shall never compromise with colonialist and racist regimes.16.	We had sincerely believed that political wisdom would have prompted us to consider realistically the heroic struggle of the people of South Viet-Nam for its genuine independence and for the enjoyment of the rights attached to the sovereignty of a people which continues to confront the forces of imperialist aggression by a united will and resistance never before equaled. This people more than any other knows the price of peace because it has long suffered from unjust wars  and the seven-point proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam illustrate this will to build a just and peaceful society in a world free of bombs  napalm and defoliants. The Government of the Republic of Mali cannot tolerate the idea that such proposals have been responded to by actions of systematic destruction of South Vietnam  by the intensification of indiscriminate bombings of the economic infrastructure of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  and by attempts to strangle this country by mining  against all legal norms  its ports and its territorial waters.17.	The courage of a people which is resolutely struggling for its freedom is only equaled by its wisdom. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam has demonstrated this once again by its declaration of 11 September 1972  proposing the creation of a tripartite provisional government of national reconciliation  representing the political  administrative and military reality of the country.18.	It cannot be over-emphasized that it is up to the Vietnamese people  and up to that people alone  to choose the political  economic and social framework in which it intends to live. All countries which love peace and justice must help that people to achieve unity so that reason may prevail over brute force 19.	We are witnessing on the same Asian continent a positive turn in the Korean situation. The Koreans  mindful of their national identity and their common destiny  have begun  in accordance with their Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 [A/8727  annex I] on the reunification of their country  talks for whose success the international community must give its full assistance. Our Organization  which has been illegally involved in the war of aggression of which the Korean people is the victim  must bring to bear all its political and moral force to achieve the peaceful unification of this country. The Koreans have taken a significant step towards the solution of their internal crisis. Let us not delay events by continuing to impose upon them the presence of military forces which use our emblem for purposes of prestige and hegemony. That is precisely why my delegation regrets the postponement of the discussion of the Korean question to the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly.20.	The device by means of which certain States have deferred from year to year the examination of this agenda item deceives no one. However  we dare to hope that our worthy Assembly has not been fooled by this and will not follow them in their fraud. It must take the opportunity offered by the device begun between the two parties to speed up  by concrete actions  the process leading to the solution of this unfortunate crisis  which for more than 20 years has tried the heroic Korean people. The three-point proposal of Marshal Kim II Sung  the well-loved and respected leader of revolutionary Korea  at least opens up the way to this.21.	Peace is therefore within reach in Korea. In order to safeguard it  it would be sufficient for us to help the parties to accelerate the process of peaceful reunification which is going on. We  for our part  remain convinced that our Organization will no longer shirk its responsibilities in Korea.22.	The continuing improvement in international relations means that no provision of the Charter may be violated with impunity. Hesitations  delays in taking decisions and tongue in cheek commitments at the time they are implemented have created areas of extreme tension in the world. The Middle East gives us a disturbing example of this. The announcement by the Secretary-General on 10 July that the Jarring mission had been resumed created a certain optimism  which the latest Israeli raids against Lebanon and Syria soon dispelled. Only the full application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) can lead to a just and lasting peace in this sorely tried region of the world. The elimination of Israeli aggression against the Arab peoples and of its consequences demands firm and energetic action by the international community. Our Organization cannot leave in frustration those thousands of Palestinians  who  like everyone else  are entitled to live in their own home and to participate fully in the political  economic  social and cultural evolution of their homeland. Israel  which continues to block the process of the settlement of the crisis  must understand that the United Nations  which it challenges with such arrogance  cannot indefinitely remain indifferent to the illegal occupation by Israeli troops of the Arab territories of Golan  Sinai  Gaza and Trans- Jordan  which it has practically annexed. We should like to assure our Arab brothers of the Arab Republic of Egypt  the Syrian Arab Republic  Lebanon  the Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine of our total solidarity in the struggle they are waging with such determination to defend the territorial integrity of their homeland and to affirm their national identity.23.	The struggle against the injustices characteristic of our society is a global one. It has no limitation in time or in space. Those political leaders who would be satisfied with maintaining a balance while bombs and napalm are churning up and burning the lands of Asia  the Middle East and Africa  have understood nothing about the aims and the objectives of the Charter. Putting an end to colonization is one of these priority objectives. If we refer to the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  we read:""The full and complete implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization remains a major goal of the United Nations."" [A/8701/ Add.l  p. 4.]24.	In the opinion of the delegation of Mali  there will be no independence or freedom in Africa as long as the peoples of Guinea (Bissau)  Angola  Mozambique  Namibia  Rhodesia and South Africa remain under colonialist and racist domination.25.	With reference to the hysterical Portuguese colonialism  Mario Soares has aptly written in his work Le Portugal baillonne:""In fact  the only specific feature of Portuguese colonialism in comparison with other European colonialisms derives essentially from the financial and mental poverty of the settlers and the economic underdevelopment of the metropolitan country  which itself is a colony of the great Powers.""26.	The Portuguese Government is not competent to teach freedom and the values of any civilization whatsoever; for otherwise  it would have applied those principles to Portugal itself. Africa is not deceived about the true intentions of the Powers members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which provide it with weapons.27.	The report of the United Nations Special Mission of inquiry which was sent to Guinea (Bissau) [A/8723/Rev.l  chap. X  annex I] has enlightened the world as to the scope of the barbarous acts carried out by the Portuguese colonial army. This session of the General Assembly should focus its full attention on two aspects of the questions raised in that document. First  it should be noted that vast areas of the territory have been liberated and that the victory of the freedom fighters over the Portuguese army is irreversible. Secondly  we must determine the specific nature of the help to be given to the people of Guinea (Bissau)  which should be both political and material.28.	The illegal regime of Ian Smith and the racists of Pretoria are warring openly against the international community. The Salisbury rebels have drawn closer to Portugal and to South Africa in order better to inculcate racial hatred and methods of repression.29.	However  despite the threats  the brutalities  the imprisonments and the assassinations perpetrated by the illegal regime of Ian Smith  the overwhelming majority of the Rhodesian population has pronounced itself against the Home-Smith agreements   which were only intended to formalize the domination of the white racists in Zimbabwe.30.	The United Nations  for its part  guided by the principles of the Charter and specifically by the provisions of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  should henceforth direct its action in Rhodesia in the light of the most recent proposals made by the African National Congress  namely  the convening of a constitutional conference on the political future of the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. That is the only initiative which can possibly put an end to the chain of violence in which the Rhodesian rebels wish to involve the country  in order to dominate it further.31.	The responsibility of Great Britain  as administering Power in the Rhodesian question  remains unimpaired.32.	We are not unaware of the fact that the moral  political  economic and military assistance which certain Powers give to the Portuguese colonialists  to the rebels in Rhodesia and to the racist Government of South Africa is utilized to put down the nationalists and to strengthen white power in southern Africa. Is it not with the weapons which are provided under these alliances that the Government of South Africa has brutally repressed the demonstrations by theologians and university students directed against the odious regime of apartheid? NATO  of which South Africa is a vassal  has thus become a system of aggression against Africa. We need only refer to the belligerent statements of the Government of Pretoria and to recall its attacks against Zambia and the United Republic ofTanzania and its pacts with the Government of Portugal and the illegal regime of Southern Rhodesia to be convinced of this.33.	Not content with oppressing and humiliating the Colored people in South Africa  the Pretoria Regime has extended the abscess of apartheid to Namibia  which it continues to occupy despite the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.  This illegal occupation  which is an insulting challenge to our Organization  is the fruit of the plan for hegemony which has always been nurtured by that retrograde regime.34.	The impotence of the United Nations in the face of the arrogance of those who preach apartheid is inadmissible. It must act promptly to see to it that the sacred right of the Namibian people to self-determination is upheld. In this way it will shoulder its responsibilities towards the international community.35.	The lack of co-operation of certain major Powers in the implementation of United Nations decisions against the white racists of southern Africa is not such as to make our task easier.36.	The coalition of the racists and of those who support colonialism must be met by a permanent aggressive front consisting of those who believe in the value of human dignity and who refuse to let the world be pushed to the brink of the abyss.37.	The recognition of the legitimacy of the struggle against colonialism so often proclaimed by our Organization should finally cease to be a mere declaration of intention and should become a fact.38.	The Assembly of Heads of State and Government held by the OAU  which unanimously decided at Rabat to double the budget for liberation movements  wished thus to show what could be done to quench the murderous flame which Portugal has lit in southern Africa and which it continues to fan in collusion with the racists of South Africa and Rhodesia.39.	The Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  which met in Georgetown  after having stressed the indivisibility of peace  adopted a position on the question of giving assistance to liberation movements  which  we are convinced  will have a certain impact on the United Nations.40.	The year 1972 undoubtedly has been rich in events which might be attributed to our Organization  whose purpose it is to bring men and peoples closer together.41.	In point of fact  the great nuclear Powers have for some time now demonstrated a certain desire  if not to put an end to the arms race  at least to hold it in check. But the progress achieved in the limitation of nuclear arms would be completely pointless if it were not followed up by general disarmament measures.42.	The objectives set for the Disarmament Decade are far from being achieved  and we can only note with some disquiet the observation of the Secretary-General:""Neither has the arms race been halted nor perceptibly slowed down. In fact  the armaments race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 3.]43.	International security  we have stated  is indivisible. Disarmament concerns us all  and it is regrettable to note that the composition of the United Nations committee entrusted with this matter does not take into account the evolution of the forces prevailing in the world.44.	Furthermore  the present formula of co-chairmanship of that body should be replaced by a more democratic formula which would fully involve all its members in the responsibility for its work. Today more than ever the need for a world disarmament conference is being felt. In order for such a conference to achieve any results  it must be carefully prepared by inviting all States to it.45.	The present trend marked by the frenzied arms race should be reversed so that the astronomical sums absorbed by arsenals can be released and devoted to the economic  social and cultural progress of man. It is the welfare and stability of the world which are at stake.46.	The democratization of international relations affects the future of the world as a whole. It applies both to the political as well as to the economic areas. In the particular case of trade  it may well open the way to undreamed-of possibilities of co-operation for the well-being of our peoples.47.	Unfortunately  neither the discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]  nor in the first and second sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  held in Geneva and New Delhi respectively  have led to any concrete measures to improve relations between the industrialized Powers and the developing countries.48.	The third session of UNCTAD  which- was held in Santiago  Chile  in April and May of 1972  has brutally revealed this fact to the world. The results of the work were so far below expectations that Mr. Tibor Mende  referring to the reluctance of the rich countries to contribute to the solution of the problem of under-development  wrote recently: ""Henceforth it is less a question of resolving the problem than of learning to live with it.""49.	Despite the resolutions adopted by the international community to overcome under-development  it is still true that the combined gross national product of the developing countries  which is on the order of $700 000 million  continues to decline whereas that of the industrialized countries  estimated at $2 million million  is progressing by approximately $100 000 million per year.50.	The net earnings of international trade could have reduced this unfortunate trend towards the excessive impoverishment of the technically backward countries; but  unfortunately  here also they are hampered by the continuing deterioration of the terms of trade. Their immense mining resources are thus outrageously exploited by the industrialized countries solely to  benefit international capitalism. Therefore it is imperative to prepare a code for international trade relations which would ensure that we could manage our own resources as we saw fit.51.	The first efforts of the countries of the third world  therefore  should be directed at the exploitation of our mining resources and potentialities in order first and foremost to serve our populations. This implies necessarily that our sovereignty should be effectively exercised over our natural wealth.52.	The assistance of the industrialized countries to the developing countries  which was far from achieving percentage-wise the figure recommended by the various resolutions of our Organization  is still tending to decline while the conditions for repayment of debts are set very strictly. This has reached such a point that the developing countries are now faced with a situation of indebtedness which does not allow them any possibility for development.53.	The negative effects of these facts on our economies are further aggravated by monetary tensions; and  as if it had not been sufficiently proved that establishing an international order would require the co-operation of everyone  solutions to monetary crises are at present being sought without the effective participation of the developing countries. International monetary reform can be viable only if it is established on the basis of a world indicative plan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2218 (XXI) on the first United Nations Development Decade.54.	The solutions which have been advocated within the context of the Second United Nations Development Decade will have little effect if there is no political will  without which no planning is feasible.55.	The over-all analyses made of the economies of the developing countries  unfortunately  do not enable world public opinion to grasp the serious human realities and social problems of the countries which are considered among the least developed of the low-income countries. The models which were generally put forward to stimulate the economic growth of the developing countries do not take into account the specific nature and the tremendous scope of their needs.56.	Over and above the reinforcement and intensification of the measures already taken for their benefit  the international community should hold free and open discussions with these countries in order to establish precise programs which would make possible the attainment of the goals set in the various resolutions and recommendations.57.	I should like now to take up a very timely question which the General Assembly  acting on the initiative of the Secretary-General of our Organization  has decided to examine. Some have already stated that this question will constitute the central focus of our discussions. Undoubtedly it cannot be denied that this is an important issue which is of concern to all mankind  but let us not forget that it is  above all  a particularly complex question  with multiple ramifications  whose examination should  therefore  be taken up in a spirit of absolute serenity and great objectivity.58.	We should like to put stress on this final wording of the title of the item and thus on the need to study first and foremost the underlying diverse causes of this phenomenon before trying to determine at all costs measures to eliminate it.59.	No one can approve of violence  wherever it may be practiced  particularly if when it is unleashed it endangers or even takes innocent human lives  but it must be realized that we will oppose any attempt thus to jeopardize by this means the actions undertaken by various liberation movements  whether in Africa  in Asia  in the Middle East or elsewhere.60.	Those are the few comments my delegation wished to make about the international situation. We have no doubt that we share these views with most of the delegations present here  which are themselves concerned over the deterioration of the internal relations of contemporary society in the political  economic  social and cultural areas. In point of fact  man  after having revolted against the injustices continuously inflicted on him  has assumed the role of judge. This explains the recrudescence of violence which characterizes the world and the resultant climate of total insecurity facing mankind. Hence for us it is much more a matter of seeking to remedy this state of affairs than of condemning or stigmatizing the phenomenon  which is simply growing because iniquities continue to exist.61.	We realize today that the world is so interdependent that no individual and no country can be sheltered from the consequences of acts of despair and hysteria. Indeed  we have never felt so much as today that the destiny of mankind is a common one. Therefore  let us pool our resources in order to hasten the transformation our society so sorely needs.62.	We must resolutely engage in a great crusade against injustice and against all causes of insecurity which daily jeopardize peace and human lives and which are called imperialism  colonialism  apartheid  hunger  disease  illiteracy  poverty and selfishness  to cite only the most familiar ones. We would thus be contributing to the achievement of a world of peace and happiness to which all our peoples so strongly aspire. Mali is determined to work for the realization of this great project when is  furthermore  in full accord with the historic mission of our generation.63.	Therefore  Mr. President  let us see to it that the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  over which you are presiding with such perspicacity and wisdom  will mark the point of departure of this great transformation. The interest of peace and the survival of humanity should stimulate our efforts to this end. Let us act therefore before it is too late."
"76",4647,"MLT",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I first of all be allowed to offer my sincere congratulations  and those of the Government and delegation of Malta  on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly? Your election to this high office is not only an honor to your great country  Poland  with which my country is proud to share many ties and common aspirations  but is an eloquent tribute to your own statesmanlike qualities. Those qualities have already been amply demonstrated during the short time you have graced the President's chair  and I am convinced that under your continued wise guidance  and with the co-operation of us all  this twenty-seventh session will prove to be one of the most fruitful in the history of the United Nations. As far as my delegation is concerned  you may count on our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of your onerous duties.219.	I should also like to offer a warm tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General  since this is my first opportunity to address the Assembly following his unanimous election. As we all know  Mr. Waldheim is well fitted  by temperament  experience  dedication and ability  to serve this Organization with the utmost distinction. To him  too  I pledge the fullest co-operation of my delegation in the performance of his duties.220.	Every year the leaders and spokesmen of the world's nations gather here from the four corners of the world  and for several weeks these halls resound to the most mellifluous oratory  the most persuasive pleas  the most passionate denunciations all directed towards the most pressing problems facing humanity today. Whether these problems affect some or all of us  whether they are old or new  lasting or fleeting  intractable or seemingly easy of solution  they are all important and must be tackled. That is what this Organization is for.221.	Sometimes  perhaps  one may be forgiven for wondering whether  after the ritual speeches are over  after the annual crop of resolutions are adopted at the end of the General Assembly's annual session  the' world does not go about its business as if nothing had taken place. This  unfortunately  is an image which has gained ground in recent years and which all of us here  who presumably believe in the United Nations and all that it stands for  must do all we can to combat. But the most effective way to restore the image of the United Nations is also the most difficult: it is  simply  to reach agreement on differences which we have so far been unable to reconcile; it is to place the common interest of mankind before national self-interest; it is voluntarily to surrender some tiny part of that cherished sovereignty which this very Organization is dedicated to uphold. In short  it requires a genuine change of heart  a fresh direction to national wills  and a realization that the world is fast changing. This change is often the result of events which are unplanned  uncoordinated and largely unpredictable in their effects. Such a realization will in turn bring about the inevitable conclusion that the old  time worn responses are no longer adequate and that nationalistic concepts must be reset in an international framework  as befits an intelligent race whose main preoccupation ought to be how to ensure the common survival on this small planet of ours.222.	'And yet  some encouragement can surely be derived from the events of the past 12 months. These events  some of which at any rate have their roots in the activities of the United Nations  may hopefully signal the first faint beginnings of a new world order based on trust and international co-operation.223.	Almost a year ago  in this very hall  we took the historic decision that brought the People's Republic of China to its rightful seat [1976th meeting]. Events followed swiftly upon each other  with the historic visits of the President of the United States of America  first to China and later to the Soviet Union. Those visits  and the official declarations to which they gave rise  were a clear indication that the world's largest Powers were moving away from the sterile postures of years of confrontation to a new era of genuine coexistence and co-operation. The reverberations of that historic breaking of the ice have not yet died down  and its effects will continue to permeate the atmosphere of international relations in the years to come.224.	Also during the past 12 months the world has seen the United States and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement on certain measures with respect to the limitation of strategic offensive arms an initial step  soon  we hope  to be followed by more substantial achievements leading towards eventual disarmament. The entry into force of the treaties signed with the Federal Republic of Germany by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and by the Polish People's Republic  together with the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the current moves aimed at normalizing relations between the two German States-both of which  I hope  we shall soon be able to welcome to this Organization-have all contributed to a relaxation of tension in Europe. The next move in this context will be the forthcoming preparatory talks soon to be held in Helsinki leading to a full-scale conference on European security and co-operation.225.	While we fully support all genuine efforts towards stability and security in Europe  it is our conviction that European security will not be completely achieved unless it is extended to the entire Mediterranean basin and accompanied by economic co-operation with all the countries of the region.226.	In other parts of the world  we have thankfully seen the end of the bloody fighting on the Indian subcontinent and the emergence of the new nation of Bangladesh. Although conditions in that part of the world have not yet returned to full peace and stability  the necessary foundations have already been laid by the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan  and it is the hope of my delegation that the next few months will see the way clear to the admission of Bangladesh to this Organization.227.	Elsewhere in Asia  the continued and growing contacts between North and South Korea afford reasonable grounds for optimism that there  too  the legacy of the cold war has been finally laid aside and the goal of genuine peaceful reunification set up in its stead. It is a matter for regret that  for the second year in succession  this Assembly will not be discussing Korea ^during this session. My delegation had hoped that by joining debate in this forum  the United Nations could have added its positive contribution to the bilateral efforts of the parties directly involved.228.	No reference to the Far East at this particular time would be complete without mentioning and welcoming the successful visit of the Head of the Japanese Government to Peking. After so many decades of estrangement it is of the utmost significance that the most economically advanced nation in Asia and the most populous nation in the world should have embarked on the path of peaceful co-operation.229.	If this brief review of positive achievements gives rise to a feeling of optimism  let me say at once that this is overshadowed by the continued persistence of conflict and explosive situations in other areas of the world. In the Middle East  the deadlock which has prevented all efforts for a political solution continues unabated  and the prescription for settlement which is to be found in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remains unimplemented. My Government reaffirms its conviction that a just and lasting peace in the area can be established only within the framework of that resolution  applied in its entirety; and while we cannot condone the continued occupation of territories by force of arms  we also recognize that each State in the area must have satisfactory guarantees to ensure its independence and territorial integrity. It is indeed sad to have to record that any faint hopes we might have entertained last year have  as a result of recent events  receded into the background. We continue to urge  however  that no effort be spared on the part of all concerned to reactivate the mission of Ambassador Jarring. My country is ready to do all it can  in any way acceptable to the parties to the dispute  in order to promote this objective.230.	In Indo-China  the horror of a war which has raged for decades continues to devastate the countries of that area. Is it too much to hope that here at least the lessons of the past will be taken to heart and those positive steps taken which alone can lead to a just solution? Lest there be any misunderstanding of Malta's position on this matter  we repeat our call for the cessation of all bombing and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the area so that all the peoples concerned can freely exercise their right to self-determination and  with their industriousness  wisdom and inexhaustible patience  be enabled finally to turn their talents to the immense task of reconstructing their long- suffering countries.231.	I turn now to Africa. It is humiliating for this Assembly to have to acknowledge that  despite all the resolutions which have been passed  despite all the obeisances made to the principles of the Charter  millions of people are still groaning under the yoke of colonialism and apartheid  the progressive forces of the world will not for ever tolerate such an iniquitous situation and  if an explosion is not to occur  the consequences of which will be as devastating as they will be unpredictable  the chains of bondage which have been fashioned by the minority racist regimes and which weigh heavily on the conscience of the whole world must come asunder. We accordingly join our voices with those of others who have appealed from this rostrum for the United Nations to give a renewed lead to the cause of eradicating colonialism in all its manifestations from the world scene.232.	The solution of the political problems to which I have briefly referred will not of itself bring prosperity to the peoples concerned. Political independence of itself is largely devoid of meaning unless it is accompanied by economic independence. My country  in common with other developing countries  has reason to have learned this lesson well. The efforts of this world Organization must continue to be bent towards the creation of a world order which ensures a fair distribution of wealth. The many programmes of the United Nations family which are geared to tackle  on a multilateral basis  such major economic problems as those which relate to trade and development  international monetary stability  the environment  and the equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed must be pursued with vigour and imagination.233.	Two events which took place this year merit particular attention. The first was the third session of UNCTAD which was held in Santiago in April and May  the other was the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June.234.	It is regrettable that the meagre results which emerged from UNCTAD's third session disappointed many of the expectations of the developing countries. The attitude of some of the more affluent nations was unfortunately coloured by considerations of self-interest  narrowly conceived. Such an attitude hardly conforms to the objectives of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. It is no wonder that the poor and the under-privileged are increasingly pointing to the growing gap between intentions and performance  a gap which is ever widening under the pressure of a fast-growing technology. The third session of UNCTAD did  of course  have its positive achievements  notably in the field of international monetary policy  where agreement was reached to associate the developing countries in the negotiations to take place under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund  as well as in the agreement to accord special assistance to the least developed of the developing countries. On the other hand  no solution emerged to the burning problem of ensuring easy access for the manufactured products of the developing countries to the markets of the developed world and to the question of stabilizing commodity prices. This lack of progress on such fundamental issues cannot but engender a feeling of frustration in the third world  and it is certainly no consolation to know that the passage of time can only compound the problems  especially as the inexorable march of technology will tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.235.	In Stockholm  the issues posed by the threat to the human environment for which this same modern technology is so largely responsible were taken up. Malta was one of the first countries to refer to the problems of pollution in relation to the marine environment when it first raised the issue of the sea-bed in this Assembly some years ago. As such  Malta could not fail to take a keen interest  and to participate actively  in the deliberations of the Stockholm Conference. That Conference recognized that different degrees of development pose different threats to the human environment. In the affluent countries the threat to the environment derives from a high level of industrial activity accompanied by a high standard of living  with all its concomitant demands. On the contrary  in the developing countries the threat to the environment arises from conditions of poverty and under-development. It is therefore important that the aspect of development should not be divorced from the continued consideration of the problems of the environment.236.	In the Mediterranean  an area with which my country is intimately concerned  the problems of pollution derive from each of these two threats. Last July  Malta took the lead in convening a meeting of Mediterranean States  to discuss matters of common concern affecting the Mediterranean  not least the problem of pollution. It is hoped that that initiative will be followed by other concrete steps to strengthen regional co-operation in matters relating to the human environment within the global strategy which was endorsed at Stockholm   among others.237.	One of the recommendations made by the Stockholm Conference concerned the establishment of a 54-member Governing Council for Environmental Programs and the creation of a secretariat to service it. The delegation of Malta  on that occasion  offered the capital of my country  Valletta  as a possible site for the environment secretariat. Today  I should like to repeat that offer.238.	Another field of United Nations activity in which Malta is keenly interested concerns the question of the sea-bed. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  in the work of which my delegation has participated actively  now approaches a crucial point in its existence. The General Assembly at its present session must review the work of the Committee and decide whether the conference on the law of the sea  tentatively scheduled for 1973 in accordance with resolution 2750 C (XXV)  should be convened.239.	While the delegation of Malta cannot express full satisfaction at the rate of progress of the Committee's work  it recognizes the complex causes  both substantive and organizational  that have made slow progress almost unavoidable. Although progress in the Committee has been slow  we believe that it has been sufficient to justify the convening on schedule of the conference on the law of the sea  particularly in view of the adoption by the Committee at its last session of a list of subjects and issues which will form the basis of discussion at the conference.240.	The positions of States on many questions relating to the law of the sea continue to remain far apart; yet we cannot afford to delay the forthcoming conference  for technology is advancing rapidly and the possibility is increasing that options will be closed and solutions imposed by those who have superior financial resources and technological capability.241.	If there is to be an early conference on the law of the sea  the United Nations sea-bed Committee must give its attention not only to negotiation of outstanding issues and to the preparation of draft treaty articles  but also to issues relating to the organization of the conference itself. This will require a broadening of the Committee's mandate  a step which we hope the General Assembly will take at its present session.242.	One of the items on the agenda of the present session concerns a review of the Charter of the United Nations [item 89]. My delegation is aware of the strong feelings aroused in many quarters by this item  and  to be quite frank  we do not believe that the time is ripe for the Charter to be profitably amended.243.	If the provisions of the present Charter are consistently violated  it would be naive to expect that an amended Charter would command greater adherence. Different or even improved procedures provide nothing more than a suitable framework for the interplay of national forces. As has been repeatedly stated  what is needed is not new procedures but a new ""political will"". Procedures in themselves will not function without the willingness to make them work  and  given such willingness  any procedure can be made to work well. None the less  it is pertinent to observe that certain provisions of the Charter not only appear to have outlived their purpose  but could even conceivably be invoked in support of gross violations of international peace and security. This is surely the case with Article 107 and  to a large extent  Article 53 of the Charter.244.	Another item on our agenda this year which has already engendered considerable feeling is that which our Secretary-General has proposed in connexion with international terrorism [item 92J. The Government and people ofMalta  as befits a civilized country  condemn every act of blind violence  ever}' manifestation of hatred between peoples  every recourse to killing and bloodshed. We are also aware  however  that violence and terrorism are frequently symptoms of a disease. We cannot  therefore  seriously expect that by denouncing or condemning these acts  however deplorable they may be  we shall be making any useful contribution towards the more desirable objective of discovering the cure that will eradicate the disease or even prevent the recurrence of further outbreaks of violence.245.	Unfortunately  the question of international violence has become entangled with such burning political issues as the conflict between the Arab States and Israel and the struggle against colonialism. In view of what happened recently in Munich and its aftermath  the issue has assumed even more the aspect of an extension of the Middle East dispute  a dispute from which Malta has kept scrupulously aloof and one which we have always deplored as a conflict between our friends. In the circumstances  much as we condemn acts of international violence and terrorism  we do not feel that we should be contributing towards a solution of this problem by denouncing either one side or the other. The road my Government has mapped out for itself does not lead to any denunciations; it only points towards a possible role of mediation by which the two sides may be brought together in search of a just and lasting solution.246.	In the field of disarmament  progress remains slow and halting  although perhaps there are grounds to hope for more concrete achievements as the spirit of detente gains momentum. Malta certainly welcomes the agreement on the limitation of strategic arms that has been concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union. We hope that this beginning will soon be followed by more significant achievements as a result of continued negotiations between the two Powers. The opening for signature of the new international Convention banning biological weapons signaled another landmark-not so much because of the nature of the weapons that have been banned as of the historical significance of a treaty which for the first time unconditionally bans certain weapons and which for that reason may be called a real disarmament measure.247.	On the other hand  I should be less than frank if I failed to express the disappointment of my Government that  despite all the efforts of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament throughout the year  no tangible progress has been recorded on what is widely regarded as the next front that has to crumble if disarmament is ever to have a chance of becoming reality: I refer to a complete ban on all nuclear testing and to the prohibition of chemical weapons. In the view of my delegation  progress on this front is essential if the proposed world disarmament conference is to be assured of a reasonable prospect of success. Similarly  the proposal before us for a declaration on the renunciation of the use of force and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/L.676]  however appealing it may appear  can hardly be meaningful unless there is a break-through on the important questions of a complete ban on nuclear testing and the prohibition of chemical weapons.248.	I have left to the end of my statement a brief reference to the policies of the Government of Malta and its preoccupations. In pursuit of its fundamental objective of friendly relations with all States  irrespective of ideology  my Government has during the past 12 months dispatched and received emissaries to and from a large number of countries  with all of which we seek to promote on a bilateral basis a form of collaboration that will be of mutual benefit to our respective peoples. All this Is being done with scrupulous adherence to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs  while at the same time promoting greater international understanding. Especially in the Mediterranean  our relations with all the littoral States are excellent  and we for our part shall continue to strive for their further consolidation. If I single out for mention the very warm relations which Malta enjoys with its immediate neighbors to the north and to tine south  Italy and Libya  it is by no means to belittle others but mainly because  apart from the practical and valued co-operation with these two countries  their symbolic geographical position  as viewed from Malta  portrays our keen interest in promoting a dialog between Europe and Africa which inevitably embraces the Mediterranean.249.	Last year  from this rostrum [1965th meeting]  I spoke of Malta's dedication to the cause of peace in the Mediterranean and expressed our unhappiness at the fact that cruel economic necessity forced us to continue to make available the use of our facilities for military purposes. Since that time there has been a radical change in the contractual basis on which such facilities have continued to be made available. Apart from ensuring adequate compensation for the benefit of our economy  it is important to emphasize  first  that these facilities do not extend to fleets of either of the two super-Powers  which we consider extraneous to the Mediterranean. Secondly and this is of great significance-under no circumstances will such facilities ever be used for offensive purposes against anyone  least of all against our Arab friends. Finally  as my Prime Minister has repeatedly and publicly made clear  the presence of foreign forces in Malta is not intended to last for more than the period stipulated by written agreement  which will come to an end in 1979. By that time we hope to have progressed sufficiently in the restructuring of our economy to be able finally to do away with the necessity of having to host foreign forces under the pressure of sheer economic necessity. To help us achieve that goal  we confidently look to our friends in Europe and elsewhere and in particular to the European Economic Community  with which we are already associated  for the necessary moral and material support."
"77",4691,"MMR",27,1972,"Mr. President  allow me first of all to extend to you the warm congratulations of the Burmese delegation on your election as President of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly. Notwithstanding the heavy responsibilities of your official duties at home  you have come here to be with us and to lend your eminent services to this Assembly in a truly international spirit of co-operation. We are confident that your wide experience and the perception and statesmanship which you have shown in the service of your country will prove valuable to you in guiding the challenging tasks of this Assembly towards a successful outcome  thereby giving added impulse to the cause of international peace  cooperation and progress.2.	I am particularly pleased to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  for the admirable manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The wisdom  dignity and good sense which he brought to this office will long be remembered.3.	I wish also to express to the Secretary-General the congratulations of the Burmese delegation on his able and penetrating appreciation contained in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/ Add.l] -of the realities of the present international situation and the future role of the United Nations.4.	The interval between the last session and the present session of the General Assembly has been a period marked by events of historical and political significance events that have fundamentally changed the configuration of international relations and have brought us to the awareness that the post-war structure of international politics has come to an end. Altogether  a new era in the international order is now taking shape before us. After having passed through over two decades of a structure of bipolar world politics imprinted with a highly charged ideological conflict  a cold war  that constantly verged on the brink of a potential nuclear outbreak  the protagonists on the world's political stage are now coming to acknowledge the realities which have emerged in the international system and seemingly are moving towards a more pragmatic relationship based upon the demands of very real mutual national interests that far transcend their differences.5.	In our view  this is clearly a welcome process. It is an evolution that fosters international detente. The more steps the major Powers take to blunt the sharp edges of ideological hostility and move towards realistic accommodation  the less justification will there be for the existence of Power blocs and the delimitation of the international community. The more the major Powers regulate their relations on the pragmatic basis of coexistence and recognize their global responsibility by reason of their great destructive capacity  the less likely are the chances of provoking a nuclear war. The world follows the current changes with great interest and with the high expectation that the major Powers will not fail to show a way out of the impasse of the last 26 years. For this to be achieved  it would obviously be necessary for any detente  any accommodation between the major Powers  to extend beyond them in order to embrace all regions  especially those where conflicts and tensions continue to exist and where the presence of such Powers is most felt.6.	The new events that have occurred are familiar to all of us and I do not propose to burden the Assembly with a detailed commentary. In summary  they include the dramatic shifts in the position of rival major Powers. After more than 20 years of hostility the first contact  established this year in Peking  between the President of the United States and the leaders of China marked a historic world turning-point. The Moscow summit last May between the President of the United States and Soviet leaders was of major political significance. These developments have led to greater flexibility in international relations.7.	The benefits of the changing international circumstances have also been felt in some long-standing areas of tension and conflict. On the Indian subcontinent and in the Korean peninsula there is a tendency on the part of the opponents to enter into a process which could  phase by phase  restore durable peace and security in their respective areas.8.	The recent Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan has contributed considerably to the lessening of tension and the promotion of peace and stability not only in the subcontinent but also in Asia as a whole. The Governments of the two countries have agreed to put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have marred their relations and to work for the promotion of a friendly and harmonious relationship and the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent so that both of them may henceforth devote their resources and energies to the pressing task of advancing the welfare of their peoples. The Burmese delegation very much welcomes this positive development.9.	In Korea  a significant breakthrough has been achieved after years of misunderstanding and mistrust  hostility and conflict. North and South Korea have agreed that the reunification of their country shall be achieved through independent Korean efforts without being subjected to external imposition or interference  that it shall be achieved through peaceful means and not through the use of force against each other  and that a great national unity shall be sought above all  transcending differences in ideas  ideologies and systems. Appropriate measures are now being taken by the two sides to achieve this national objective.10.	I cannot help also mentioning that elsewhere in Asia significant movements are under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  and the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of intervention by outside Powers. We believe that the prospects for the success of these movements would greatly improve if the major Powers would cease using the region as an arena of influence and abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence-notably the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.11.	All in all  these developments of historical and political import hold forth greater promise for the future than the last 26 years of crisis and hostility. They represent great decisions in terms of overcoming one's self and in terms of the exercise of a high degree of moral responsibility and statesmanship by the leaders of our contemporary world.12.	All countries have a clear interest in the evolution of a world which allows for peaceful and stable coexistence. The past year has seen the basic principles of peaceful coexistence gaining more and more ground among the major Powers. In this connexion it is of particular significance that the United States of America and the People's Republic of China  in their joint communique issued at Shanghai on 27 February 1972  and the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  in their statement of basic principles on their mutual relations issued at Moscow on 29 May 1972   pledged themselves to abide by the basic principles of peaceful coexistence  thus expanding the area of acceptance of those principles in international relations. As a country that has upheld those principles and applied them in pursuing a policy of active friendship with ail nations  Burma naturally welcomes their application to the fullest extent in international relations. For humanity to prosper without fear or suspicion  we must engender in the world community a sense of faith and confidence in inter-State relations. The prerequisite for this is the willingness and determination of all nations to live together as good neighbors  irrespective of each other's political  economic and social systems  and to observe the principles of peaceful coexistence namely  mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit.13.	In spite of the tangible results of the international detente now unfolding before us  we do not overlook the fact that in IndoChina and in the Middle East the situation is one of sharp contrast  and it is a sad commentary on our times that it should remain unsolved for years on end.14.	The continued rivalry and intervention of outside Powers in the States of IndoChina still threaten the peace and security of the South-East Asian region. This intervention has resulted only in untold suffering  the loss of countless lives and massive material destruction. As a nation belonging to the same region and having experienced the senseless rigors of war on its soil during the Second World War  Burma is deeply concerned with the tragic plight of all the peoples of IndoChina. In particular  the situation in Viet-Nam continues to weigh heavily on the conscience of nations. The tragedy is that for 30 years the people of VietNam have been subjected continuously to violence and untold misery. We cannot but be struck by the scale and intensity of the hostilities that continue and the devastating proportions of the modern weaponry employed. The delegation of Burma believes that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the States of IndoChina  a firm commitment by outside Powers not to intervene in any manner whatever  under any circumstances  in the internal affairs of those States  and direct negotiations between the indigenous parties concerned to achieve national reconciliation all these conditions are necessary to enable the peoples of those States to work out peaceful solutions to their problems by themselves.15.	As far as the Middle East situation is concerned  Burma views the stalemate as capable of sowing seeds of discord and generating unrest among the peoples of the region. This could erupt into violence and threaten the stability of their own countries  as well as the peace and security of the world. In a year in which so many sharp modifications have occurred in other areas of tension  it would be to the general relief of the international community if the opponents in the Middle East were to rethink their positions and respond to the trends of world detente. The problems of the Middle East are highly emotional and complex and can be solved only by peaceful means and not by means of armed force. To our mind  Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to provide a sound basis for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem.16.	Although there have been significant changes in the nature of the international system in the course of this year  three major features of the world that developed in the post-war period are destined to dominate the life of the international community for a considerable time. These are the issues of the prevention of nuclear war  the bridging of the economic gap between the developed and the developing nations  and the racial conflict over color. All three issues  which plague humanity  are matters of man's struggle for survival free from fear of the nuclear bomb and on the basis of equality and justice.17.	The Burmese delegation has always been of the view that the ultimate goal of the entire human race in the field of disarmament must be the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Indeed  we believe there is no alternative to that.18.	But  as we all know  general and complete disarmament raises a multiplicity of complex and delicate issues which strike at the very heart of the security and sovereignty of nations. It presupposes the existence of an effective system of universal collective security  without military alliances  such as that envisaged in the Charter as well as a further maturing of the spirit and ideals of internationalism. Therefore the achievement of general and complete disarmament would necessarily take time. In the circumstances  the Burmese delegation feels that the immediate efforts of the international community could more gainfully be directed towards achieving agreements on what are commonly referred to as collateral or partial measures of disarmament designed to contain and reduce the dimensions of the armaments problem and thereby to bring the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament that much nearer. In this context the Burmese delegation is of the view that arms control and disarmament measures related to weapons of mass destruction should be given first priority.19.	The ominous implications of nuclear weapons will continue to impinge upon our lives; and the foremost problem  the prevention of nuclear war  can be solved only through the pursuit of measures of arms control and disarmament specifically in the nuclear field. The life of man today is corroded by his fear of the nuclear weapon  which if let loose would mean his annihilation. A world dominated by nuclear-armed super-Powers is not a pleasant prospect and each small step those Powers take towards control of their nuclear weapons should be welcomed in the context of progress in the disarmament talks.20.	The first tentative opening towards limitation of their strategic arms has been made by the United States and the Soviet Union. The Moscow agreements of 26 May 1972 of those two foremost nuclear Powers on  respectively  the limitation of and a moratorium on their defensive and offensive strategic weapons provide prospects for the inauguration of further nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. In order to underpin the viability of the Moscow agreements on strategic arms limitation  the conclusion of an underground test-ban treaty has clearly assumed greater urgency  since such a measure can help arrest the further qualitative development of nuclear weapons. Burma would urge that the first productive outcome of the Moscow agreements should lie in the direction of a ban on underground nuclear tests to complement the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty and thus finally to achieve a comprehensive test ban.21.	Another matter which needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency is the elimination of chemical weapons from the arsenals of all States. In the view of the Burmese delegation the aim of the negotiations in this regard should clearly be the complete and effective prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all types of chemical weapons and the total destruction of existing stockpiles  and the working out of the adequate and effective verification procedures that would make such a comprehensive prohibition possible. We therefore favor a comprehensive approach to the problem  since a partial approach cannot lead to a comprehensive solution.22.	As regards the task of bridging the economic gap between the developed and the developing nations-the situation of the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" all that can be said at present is that there is as yet no evidence of a break-through. Despite all the efforts at the national and international levels  the phenomenon of a widening disparity continues to exist. When the United Nations was conceived in 1945 it was not envisaged that the conscious aim set forth in the Preamble to the Charter ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom"" would have special relevance to the developing nations. Few then gave so much as a thought to the possibility that the problem of the developing nations would assume primacy in the economic and social work of the United Nations. But two thirds of the world's population belong to the developing world and their physical needs have to be met and their hunger for human dignity satisfied.23.	We are all aware that the trends have not been in favor of the developing countries. The decline in their share of world exports  their rising burden of debt and their slow rate of growth are amply documented in United Nations reports  which bear testimony to the sad state of international co-operation in this field. The outcome of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ held at Santiago  Chile  also provides us with an important case in point. UNCTAD has been useful in providing a forum for the discussion of a wide range of economic problems of interest to the developing countries. It has no doubt helped to define the issues more clearly and  as a consequence  has contributed to a better understanding and appreciation of the problems of the developing countries. However  despite this greater understanding  a more concerted international effort to overcome the difficulties was not in evidence at the Santiago session. It is common knowledge that no significant progress was made on substantive issues and that the achievements fell far short of the aspirations of the Group of 77 developing countries as contained in the Lima Declaration. 24.	The past year has also witnessed further upheavals on the international monetary scene. It is not necessary to emphasize here that a new and equitable international monetary arrangement to meet the needs of world trade and development is an urgent necessity at this time. We hope that such a system will soon be implemented with the full participation of all interested parties.25.	It would be an illusion to believe that the developing nations could catch up with the developed within a few decades. What is imperative  however  is a continuing narrowing of the gap  instead of a widening of it. Obviously  no nation can be developed solely from external resources; in the final analysis the prime mover in development will always have to be a country's own effort and its will to rely on its own resources. But  the world being interdependent  the problems of the developed and the developing are in a state of permanent interaction  and progress in development can be achieved only on the basis of collaboration between the two.26.	Another challenge of our times is the problem of racial conflict over color. Vestiges of the most virulent forms of colonialism and its concomitant evils  racism and racial discrimination  are still a live phenomenon which permeates the relation of man to man in certain parts of southern Africa. It is hardly necessary to stress that the subjection of peoples to alien domination and exploitation constitutes not only a violation of the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples but also a denial of fundamental human rights. TTie persistence of repressive measures to deprive peoples of still dependent Territories in southern Africa of their right to self-determination  freedom and independence is of growing concern. The situation there is one of conflict  with international ramifications. So long as the Governments concerned continue to react against the tide of world opinion  and so long as certain important PcweiS tend to indulge in covert evasion of United Nations sanctions  the tension in Africa is bound to increase both in range and in intensity and to impede the attainment of the United Nations ideal of peace and security.27.	The current worldwide movement of political and social changes will inevitably have their impact on the United Nations. The challenge the Organization is faced with may be greater than in the past and every effort will have to be made to strengthen and develop the United Nations in consonance with the changed conditions and needs of the world. The work of the United Nations must  therefore  be conceived and devised against that background. Significantly  the rigid power structures of the past are giving way to a diversity among nations and new power centers have emerged  allowing for greater freedom and flexibility among nations. Simply stated  this means that the time is not far off when the Charter of the United Nations will be due for revision and for adjustment to these broad forces. In dealing with the rising concerns of the population explosion  environmental pollution and ecological imbalance  the Organization's area of work and activities will continue to grow in volume and complexity and inevitably entail increased expenditures. If we are to succeed in them  it will be necessary for the United Nations to take appropriate steps and measures for a more rational division and co-ordination of work among its network of agencies and organizations  in order that the available financial resources of the Organization may be kept within reasonable and controllable frontiers. The Burmese delegation shares the general concern at the dour ting expenditure of the United Nations  particularly its administrative costs. We are therefore highly gratified that the Secretary-General has personally taken this matter in hand. We should like to commend him for the determined and decisive manner in which he has been enforcing economy measures in the Organization  which have already yielded considerable results  and to assure him of our support and co-operation in his further efforts in the same direction.28.	In conclusion  the Burmese delegation feels that the international community is now entering upon a new era of negotiation and accommodation  leaving behind an era of confrontation and conflict. The methods of diplomacy will in our view again become of vital importance to nations which seek to pursue their interests successfully and peacefully. There can be no doubt that  in solving international problems of a political  economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character  multilateral diplomacy becomes a necessity. The United Nations  as the center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of that objective  is the best forum for the conduct of multilateral diplomacy. The Burmese delegation hopes that the major Powers will abandon their tendency to by-pass the United Nations in seeking solutions to international problems of vital importance and will make full use of the United Nations and its organs for this purpose. To the extent that the States Members of the United Nations actively participate in working out solutions to international problems  they are bound to have a greater sense of involvement and responsibility  thereby lending greater impetus and effectiveness to the work of the United Nations."
"78",4747,"MNG",27,1972,"Comrade President  first of all I should like on behalf of the	delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic to offer you our warm congratulations on your election to the lofty post of President of the present session of the General Assembly and to wish you great success in carrying out yourresponsible duties. Your election is evidence of the generalrecognition of the great effort which socialist Poland iscontributing to the improvement of the situation in Europeand the strengthening of peace and international security.98. My delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  Mr. Waldheim  and wishes him everyI success in carrying out the difficult but noble tasksentrusted to him in working for the establishment of universal security and the strengthening of the United Nations as the main instrument for the maintenance of peace.99.	The present session of the General Assembly is beginning its work at a time when the world is witnessing positive progress towards detente and the strengthening of the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation among States. This positive development in international life is the result primarily of a deep and irreversible change in the general alignment of forces which is promoting the cause of peace  national independence and the social progress of peoples.100.	The consistent and purposeful policy of peace pursued by the countries of the socialist community and vigorous activities of all peace-loving  anti-imperialist and democratic forces are a determining factor in this improvement in the world political climate. Those States which take due account of present political realities in carrying on their international activities are also making their contribution.101.	The principle of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems is gaining increasing recognition as a generally accepted norm of contemporary international life. It is reflected in a spirit of better mutual understanding  good-neighborliness and business-like co-operation be-tween States.102.	We consider that the outcome of the Soviet- American summit meeting  the entry into force of the treaties between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  and the four Power agreement on West Berlin   and the signing in December 1971 of the celebrated agreements between the German Democratic Republic  on the one hand  and the Federal Republic of Germany and the West Berlin Senate  on the other  can be viewed as among the most important international events which clearly reflect the present trend towards detente.103.	The Government of the Mongolian. People's Republic considers that these events are in the long-term interests of the peoples of the world.104.	However  there is no room for complacency. There still exist forces which are unfavorably disposed to international detente  in particular  to progress towards agreement on the crucial issues of our time and an improvement in mutual relations between States  and to the successes achieved by peoples in their struggle for freedom  national independence and social progress.105.	The present international situation is complex and unstable and presents for the world community and  especially  the United Nations  the urgent task of increasing and making more effective the efforts aimed at maintaining and strengthening international peace and security and averting the threat of a thermo-nuclear war.106.	It is for these reasons that Mongolia considers  as does the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations  that the problem of strengthening inter-national security should become the main subject for consideration at the present session of the General Assembly. The discussion of this urgent problem should reveal the root-causes of the perpetuation of the abnormal conditions prevailing in the world and once again draw general attention to the urgent necessity for the immediate elimination of hotbeds of war and crisis situations in various parts of the world. It is no secret that the explosive situations in one part of the world or another are due to the violation by certain States Members of the United Nations of the principle of the Charter enjoining States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other State.107.	In this connexion  the Mongolian delegation would like to draw special attention to the timeliness and great practical significance of the item entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [item 25] proposed by the Soviet Government for consideration at the current session of the General Assembly [A/8793].108.	We consider that in the present circumstances the consistent application of the principle of non-use of force will undoubtedly contribute to the elimination of existing armed conflicts and the creation of more favorable conditions for ending the arms race and bringing about general and complete disarmament.109.	The Mongolian delegation fully endorses the basic provisions of the draft resolution submitted yesterday by the Soviet delegation [A/L.676] for consideration at the present session concerning the renunciation by States Members of the United Nations of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons. The adoption and practical implementation of such a resolution would be an important contribution to the carrying out of one of the basic provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].110.	It is our view that the immediate halting of United States aggression in Indochina and the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression in the Middle East are essential preconditions for the strengthening of universal peace and security.111.	The United States Government has not only failed to put an end to its neo-colonialist war against Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos but is escalating it by renewing the barbarous bombing of vital centres  dams and dikes in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and by blockading its ports and other lines of communication. Under cover of the much-publicized troops withdrawals from South Viet-Nam  the United States is  in fact  building up its armed strength and increasing its military presence in Indo-China.112.	The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic have consistently supported the just struggle of the heioic Viet-Namese people and the patriotic forces of Cambodia and Laos. They have always considered that the problem of Indo-China should be settled by peaceful means on the basis of the unconditional recog-nition of the inalienable right of the peoples of those countries to self-determination and independent devel-opment without outside interference. The United States must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from South Viet-Nam and put an end to the ""Viet- Namization"" of the war. It must discontinue its support of the anti-popular regime in Saigon and recognize the political realities of the situation in South Viet-Nam. This will be a decisive condition for the settlement of the problem of Viet-Nam on the basis of the well-known and constructive proposals of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.113.	The Mongolian Government considers that the perpetuation of the crises in the Middle East constitutes a growing threat to universal peace and security. It is common knowledge that the basic cause of the continuing tension in that region lies in Tel Aviv's stubborn refusal to carry out the Security Council resolutions and  in particular  to withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Israel's recent acts of aggression against a number of Arab countries serve as a stern reminder of the real danger of a new outbreak of fighting. Israeli ruling circles have dared to throw down an open challenge to world public opinion because they can rely on the growing financial and military support of the United States.114.	It is essential to make new efforts to implement the well-known Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  and to reactivate for that purpose the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It must not be forgotten that the united actions of all peace-loving forces are of decisive significance for the just and peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. In this connexion  we think that the United Nations must be more active in seeking out ways and means of utilizing all positive factors which may contribute towards such a settlement.115.	The Mongolian People's Republic considers that the establishment of regional security systems will undoubtedly be an important factor in the safeguarding of universal peace and security.116.	In the present - circumstances  collective efforts towards that goal may bring practical results. Evidence of this may be found  in particular  in the positive progress achieved in Europe  which may  subject to further favor-able development  provide the basis for lasting peace and co-operation in Europe. The lessons of two devastating world wars have taught us that the international situation in Europe has a very direct bearing on the interests of the peoples of other continents  too. For this reason we welcome any step towards improving the political climate in Europe.117.	In this connexion  our delegation is gratified to note the normalization of relations between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The normalization of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  on the basis of the recognition of the Munich Agreement as invalid from the outset  will undoubtedly serve to improve the general European situation.118.	The Mongolian People's Republic supports the idea of convening an all-European conference on security and co-operation. The holding of such a conference will be an important milestone in the efforts to establish a collective security system in that part of the world.119.	As events have shown  Asia is a continent badly in need of a stable and lasting peace.120.	Our Government responds actively to  and supports  any constructive proposals and specific measures designed to eliminate hotbeds of tension and promote the development of good-neighborly relations between all the countries of Asia.121.	The Mongolian People's Republic has always sup-ported the idea of establishing a collective security system in Asia. It may be said that recently  when the Governments of many Asian countries have been taking a new look at  and critically assessing  their positions on the problems of lasting peace and security in that huge region  increasing interest has been shown in the idea of collective security. We are in favor of the establishment of such a security system  which would be based strictly on the principles of the Charter and would embrace all States of the continent regardless of their different social systems.122.	Our delegation is pleased to note certain progress which is currently being made in relations between Asian States towards the creation of a stronger spirit of realism and mutual understanding.123.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic has welcomed the positive outcome of the meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Pakistan at Simla  which has cleared the way for the normalization and improvement of the situation in the Indian subcontinent. We hope that the results of that meeting will be consolidated by new positive measures in the interests of strengthening peaceful conditions on the subcontinent and in Asia.124.	The settlement of the Korean question in full accord with the basic interests of the Korean people is of considerable importance for the strengthening of peace and security in Asia. The sine qua non of this settlement still is the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. The United Nations must work towards the positive solution of the problem of the peaceful unification of Korea. That is why Mongolia became a sponsor of a new item entitled ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea"" which was proposed for consideration at the current session of the General Assembly [A/8752/AddA].125.	The postponement of the consideration of this important item once again deprives the United Nations of the opportunity to have a business-like discussion on the question with a view to the normalization of the situation in the Korean peninsula in the interests of strengthening peace and security in Asia.126.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic will continue to support the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the settlement of the Korean problem in accordance with the national interests of the Korean people.127.	The achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict international control  and in particular nuclear disarmament  is a decisive material and moral precondition for the establishment of universal peace and security on earth and the banishment of war from the life of human society.128.	In this connexion  the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes with great satisfaction the signing at Moscow on 26 May 1972 by the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America of the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with Respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. The signing of these agreements represents real progress towards a solution of the problem of the limitation of the arms race. They can open up great possibilities for agreement on further measures in a vital aspect of arms limitation and disarmament  namely the banning of nuclear weapons.129.	It seems to us perfectly natural that other nuclear Powers  too  should display some initiative of their own and attempt to consolidate and multiply the results of these measures which  although the first in the field  are of far-reaching importance. The interests of all humanity demand that they do so.130.	The position of our Government on the convening of a world disarmament conference has been set forth in detail in its reply to the Secretary-General's letter [see A/8817]. Recognizing the great importance of such a conference  our Government is in favor of an immediate start being made on practical preparations for the convening of the conference in the near future. It is our view that the present session of the General Assembly should  in fact  set in motion preparations for this forum  at which all the States of the world will take part in discussion of the most crucial issue of our time-general and complete disarmament.131.	In addition  efforts must be made to reach early agreement on such pressing problems as the cessation of all forms of nuclear weapons tests by all States  the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons  and so on.132.	The Mongolian People's Republic  together with eight other socialist countries  has sponsored a draft convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction [see A/8818  annex B  sect. 5]. Like the other sponsors  we advocate the immediate and complete prohibition of all forms of chemical weapons. The overwhelming majority of States supports this position. Our delegation will set forth in detail its position on this and other disarmament questions when they are taken up specifically.133.	Colonial domination and racial oppression pose a constant threat to international peace and universal security. The United Nations must take effective steps to eliminate colonialism and racism in all their forms and manifestations.134.	The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic express their solidarity and unflagging support for the peoples of Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau)  Namibia and Zimbabwe in their heroic struggle to cast off colonialism and racial oppression and achieve national self-determination and independence. The national liberation movement is winning new victories  but the imperialist Powers are stubbornly resisting the final over-throw of colonialism.135.	The Mongolian peoples expresses its zealous solidarity with all oppressed peoples in their just struggle for freedom and independence. Our Government maintains that the decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning southern Africa should be implemented by all States without exception.136.	The Mongolian People's Republic urges the further development and strengthening of international economic ties and co-operation on the basis of equal rights  mutual advantage  justice and respect for the lawful interests and needs of all countries  in particular developing countries.137.	It should be stressed at this point that recognition of the existence of two world economic systems would serve as a sound basis for the normal development of inter-national economic relations.138.	As the third session of UNCTAD has shown  the main reasons for the extremely abnormal situation in the world economy and in economic relations are the exploitation of the under-developed countries  and the discrimination practiced by the Western Powers in international economic relations and their stubborn resistance to the introduction of just and democratic principles and methods in international economic life. Consequently  the appropriate United Nations bodies  above all the Economic and Social Council  must improve their effectiveness and get down to the job of finding ways and means of normalizing world economic relations on a just and democratic basis.139.	There is  I think  no need to dwell on the weight which we attach to the role and activities of the United Nations as an important instrument for the strengthening of international peace and security. Here we should like to stress once again that the United Nations is still not making full use of the possibilities provided in the Charter. Our delegation considers that the strict observance of the Charter would enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and promote the strengthening of international security. The difficulty lies  not in the obsolescence or weakness of the Charter  but in the fact that certain States Members of the United Nations disregard and refuse to implement its most important provisions. Our position of principle on this question remains unchanged. We are against any attempt to revise the basic provisions of the Charter  no matter what the pretext.140.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic advocates the achievement of true universality in theUnited Nations  which would play an important part in enhancing its role and effectiveness. The admission of the two German States to the United Nations would undoubtedly be an important step towards achieving genuine universality and would put an end to discrimination against the German Democratic Republic  a State which is doing much to strengthen peace and develop international co-operation in Europe and throughout the world. In this connexion  we feel that the first step to be taken towards ending the discrimination against the German Democratic Republic is to grant it the status of permanent observer at United Nations Headquarters  as was done in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany.141.	Our delegation cannot help expressing its regret  too  at the unjust treatment of a young Asian State whose 75 million people recently emerged victorious from a hard and just struggle for freedom and national independence. In our view  the founding of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is a historic fact recognized by the overwhelming majority of members of the international community. In present circumstances  when the majority of Members wish to see the United Nations become a truly universal body and wish to free it from the burden of past errors  opposition to the admission of this sovereign State to the United Nations is particularly distasteful. Obstructive tactics of this kind are not conducive to the normalization of the situation in the Indian subcontinent and damage the prestige of the United Nations. We are confident that the People's Republic of Bangladesh will take its lawful seat in this world organization.142.	It is of particular importance to increase the effectiveness of the Security Council  which bears the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace. In this connexion  measures should be taken to improve the methods of work of that body  making use of the possibilities provided in the Charter. We are of the opinion that the periodic meetings of the Security Council should be held more often  in keeping with Article 28 of the Charter  so that it could give fuller consideration to the pressing problems of international life  including questions connected with the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security.143.	It is also necessary to resolve the question of the speedy elaboration of principles and guidelines for the effective functioning of the Security Council in the field of peace-keeping operations.144.	The Mongolian people views the maintenance and strengthening of universal peace as an important external condition for the successful building of a new life and the solution of the difficult problems of socialist development in our country. In close union with fraternal socialist countries and in co-operation with peace-loving and democratic forces  the Mongolian People's Republic is striving to further the noble aim of strengthening peace  mutual understanding and co-operation between peoples.145.	Our delegation hopes that the present session of the General Assembly will make its contribution to the solution of the urgent problems of international life with a view to strengthening mutual understanding and co-operation between States and consolidating the peace and security of peoples. Allow me to assure you  Mr. President  that the constructive efforts of the United Nations towards those goals will enjoy the full support of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic.146.	Mr. AL-SOWEIDI (United Arab Emirates): ** Mr. President  it is with great pleasure that I extend to you the congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session. Poland and the Arab nation  of which my country is an integral part  have had for many years the closest and most friendly relations.147.	May I also express our appreciation for the brilliant manner in which Mr. Adam Malik  the illustrious Foreign Minister of Indonesia  presided over the previous session.148.	We also wish our new Secretary-General success in the discharge of his important responsibilities.149.	In this first year of our independence  our main task has been to find our proper place and role in the international community  a place and role determined by our history  geographical position  economic resources and  above all  by the desires and expectations of our people.150.	Our Union is open to all Arab countries in the Gulf area and elsewhere. We are firm believers in the ideal of Arab unity and we hope that our example will reverse the trend towards fragmentation and division in the Arab world and herald a new era in which the Arab nation will be able to play a beneficent and significant role in world affairs which its history  its culture and its resources entitle it to play. We have fully identified ourselves with the fundamental positions of principle taken by the Arab countries within the framework of the League of Arab States  of which we are now a member.151.	The question euphemistically called ""The situation in the Middle East"" [item 21]  and which I would prefer to call by its proper name ""the question of Palestine""  remains the central national issue for the Arab people. Essentially it is the plight of a people dispossessed and driven out of its homeland by a colonialist armed invasion. So long as the people of Palestine are denied their fundamental rights in their ancestral homeland  there can be no settlement  nor peace in the Middle East.152.	A good deal has been said recently about the problem of terrorism. Israel  of course  has been attempting to derive some propaganda advantage and to exploit a very serious human problem  so characteristic of our times  to achieve narrow and selfish political gains and to set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and the fulfillment of its well-known expansionist aims. I am certain that the General Assembly will not be diverted by these crude and obvious maneuvers from its duty to discuss the issue with the sense of sober responsibility it deserves.153.	The people of Palestine have waited in vain for a quarter of a century for some redress of the grave injustice inflicted upon them. The international community  whose collective will this Organization represents  has seemed to be oblivious to their plight and through its inaction  over the years  has implicitly acquiesced in Israel's aggression. Israel was founded and has maintained itself by the systematic and ruthless practice of terror: terror which drove the majority of Palestinians out of their homeland  terror which deprived them of freedom and dignity  terror which made the remnants who stayed behind second-class citizens in their own country  terror which pursued them in their unhappy exile  in their wretched refugee camps  and slaughtered them by the hundreds. We do not and cannot condone the killing of innocent people  but how can we equate the desperate acts of a few individuals driven by ""misery  frustration  grievance and despair""  to quote the Secretary-General's words [see Aj8791/Add.l]  with the brutal  deliberate and cold-blooded acts of indiscriminate killing perpetrated by the armed forces of a State? Let us not make the mistake of thinking that these are acts of revenge; they are concerned primarily with the achievement of long-standing strategic and political aims.154.	Our geographical position in the Gulf has given us a vital interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in that important economic and strategic area of the world. We have endeavored to establish the closest relations with our neighbors. It is our firm belief that the peace and stability of the Gulf region can be maintained only with the co-operation of its States and with their respect for one another's independence and territorial integrity. Whatever disputes or differences exist at present or may arise in the future can and must be resolved by peaceful means and in a manner that will recognize and preserve the legitimate rights of all parties concerned without prejudice to their basic national interests. We are ready now  as we have always been  to co-operate with our neighbors to create a climate of understanding and harmony  which is essential for the peace and progress of the region and the welfare of all its people. The peace and security of the Gulf will be greatly enhanced by making the Indian Ocean region a zone of peace. We support the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on this question [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and will welcome any further action at this session to ensure its implementation.155.	We are meeting at a time of rapid and sometimes dramatic change in the world situation. There have been unmistakable and welcome signs of a detente among the great Powers  a development of great importance in view of the fact that under the Charter these States have a primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is our hope that this is the beginning of an irreversible trend towards a greater degree of genuine international co-operation and not merely a temporary interruption in the cold war. Thus  on the central problem of war and peace we are entitled to express some cautious optimism. There are certainly some clear and concrete grounds for such optimism: the agreement on the partial limitation of strategic weapons  the ratification of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland  the four-Power agreement on Berlin and the understanding reached between the two Governments of Korea  which may lead to the unification of that country. These encouraging developments have paradoxically given rise to some anxiety among the smaller countries. There is a feeling that the reduction of tensions among the great Powers may lead to the imposition of solutions to international problems that will ignore the desires and interests of other countries  especially those directly concerned. We hope that these fears are un-founded.156.	As we look at the agenda of this session  we still see some of the problems which have been dealt with by this Organization since its inception  such as colonialism and apartheid. A genocidal war is being waged against the African people who are struggling to free themselves from colonial domination. The racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to flout the will of the international community  encouraged by their undiminished trade with their Western trading partners and the continued flow of investments from abroad.157.	In their meeting held in Cairo earlier this month  the Arab Foreign Ministers issued a declaration on South East Asia affirming the solidarity of the Arab States with the peoples of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos in their struggle for national liberation and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from their lands. The declaration also condemned the aggression to which those countries have been subjected.158.	It will be unnecessary for me to dwell upon the serious economic problems facing the developing countries and the failure of all attempts to narrow the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Perhaps nowhere is the tendency of certain advanced countries to take decisions affecting others more pronounced than it is in economic matters. Problems relating to the international monetary system and trade are discussed and dealt with by the major Powers without much concern for the vital interests of the developing countries. The third session of UNCTAD revealed the problem facing' the developing countries in all its painful dimensions. It is obvious that the developing countries have to strengthen and expand the co-operation among themselves and that they should shift their emphasis from exhortations addressed to the developed countries  which have largely fallen on deaf ears  to the greater possibilities of cooperation among themselves.159.	We have established a development fund with an initial capital of over $100 million to assist the countries of the region in their plans of development. Over and above this  we are also ready to contribute  within the limits of our means  to the various international and regional development activities undertaken by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.160.	There is undoubtedly a close link between the problems of development and disarmament. If only a fraction of the billions being squandered on the arms race were diverted to the urgent needs of the developing countries  then the whole depressing picture which con-fronts us today would be transformed beyond recognition. For this reason we support the convening of an inter-national conference on disarmament  with a view to the reduction and ultimate elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.161.	An event of great importance this year has been the adoption of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and the machinery being established to put into effect the principles and aims of that Declaration.162.	I finally come to the question of the United Nations and the strengthening of its role and efficacy. This has always been a major concern of the smaller countries  such as my own. It stems from the belief that only through the United Nations can we translate into living reality the principles and ideals which bind us together. But it would be idle to pretend that the United Nations is not now  and has not been for some years  passing through a period of decline. The Organization has been purposely and rigorously prevented from playing any role in some crucial international problems. The United Nations has been rendered virtually powerless  through the obstruction of certain great Powers  to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Palestine  the Middle East  apartheid and colonialism. But we must first of all recognize that there are certain inherent weaknesses in the Charter itself. The Charter is  after all  a document which was drawn up before the advent of the nuclear age when a vast number of countries were still under foreign rule.163.	The Charter is also based on two basic assumptions which have been largely overtaken by the spectacular developments of the last quarter of a century. The two assumptions are that the hegemony of the great Powers will always be accepted as a permanent fact of international life and that the great Powers will  more often than not  act together to deal with major international problems. How-ever  in spite of its structural defects and the invalidity of its basic assumptions  the Charter is flexible enough to enable us to transform it into an effective instrument of the international order which we envisage for the future.164.	As a token of our faith in the United Nations and confidence in its future  my Government has decided to respond favorably to the appeal of the Secretary-General and make a contribution which we hope will help to alleviate the financial difficulties facing the Organization."
"79",4834,"MRT",27,1972,"Mr. President  allow me  first of all  to associate myself with the preceding speakers in extending the sincere and warm congratulations of the Mauritanian delegation on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The confidence unanimously shown in you by all States Members of the United Nations constitutes a deserved tribute to your talents and to your statesmanlike qualities and also striking proof of the esteem that the international community holds for your country  its people  and its distinguished leaders. In the accomplishment of your difficult but important mission  my delegation wishes to assure you of its entire and loyal co-operation.79.	My delegation also wishes to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  for the skill  impartiality and patience  and also for the subtlety  dedication and tact  he displayed in presiding over the long and difficult debates of the twenty-sixth session.80.	I should also like to express to our Secretary-General our satisfaction with his efforts to help bring peace to the world and in particular with his eagerness to help the countries of the third world in their struggle to resolve their many problems. We are also following closely his initiatives in reorganizing the Secretariat out of a concern for efficacy and economy.81.	We are also particularly happy to see among us today the delegation of the People's Republic of China  whose presence in this hall we hail after a long wait. I should like to pay a tribute of admiration and sympathy to that delegation and to the great Chinese people. My delegation welcomes the presence of China  and I am happy to say so publicly and sincerely. We are convinced that the presence of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will contribute to the settlement of many problems confronting the Organization.82.	Despite the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China  despite the elements of detente that have emerged in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  and the United States and China  the twenty-seventh session is meeting at a time when grave problems continue to threaten international peace and security.83.	Murderous wars in the purest colonial style continue to rage in various parts of the world. The absence of any real will for general and complete disarmament and the disappointing results of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] are a matter of concern to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and to all countries that love peace and justice.84.	Thus  the African peoples continue to suffer under the savage yoke of Portuguese colonialism  aided by inter-national imperialism. To be sure  these people are organizing themselves and every day the national liberation movements of Guinea (Bissau) and the Cape Verde Islands  Mozambique and Angola  testify to their determination to fight to the end to bring down the illegal Portuguese rule.85.	In Zimbabwe  in South Africa  in Namibia  colonialism is compounded by the contemptible system of apartheid  which arbitrarily condemns the majority of the population to languish in moral and material wretchedness and permits the racist white minority to live with impunity on the natural and human resources of the majority.86.	It is high time that the international community took effective steps to put an end to this intolerable situation prevailing in southern Africa. The United Nations  if it is not to condemn itself for good  cannot fail to take up the continuous challenge thrown down to it by South Africa  Portugal and the racist regime of Rhodesia. No responsible country  no man of good faith  can feel free so long as millions of human beings remain deprived of their most elementary right to a life of freedom and dignity.87.	Similarly  international peace  security and concord can never validly be established so long as all peoples have not had recognized their inalienable rights to freedom  independence and dignity.88.	Confronted with this extremely painful situation  imposed on our brothers in southern Africa by the colonialists and racists  with the effective support of international imperialism  my country would like once again forcefully to reaffirm its support and militant solidarity with our African brothers in South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe  in Mozambique  in Angola and inGuinea (Bissau)  in their heroic struggle against injustice and arbitrary rule  for freedom  in peace and dignity.89.	This arduous but determined struggle will surely triumph despite the fanatic stubbornness of Portugal and the white minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia which refuse to look reality in the face while continuing to offer insolent defiance to the United Nations.90.	Before leaving decolonization  I should like to mention a final problem to which my country attaches special importance since it is of direct interest to ourselves. I refer to the question of the Sahara under Spanish rule.91.	This problem is indeed one of the major concerns of my Government since it is a problem which intimately and deeply affects the Mauritanian people. It concerns us by reason of every kind of tie-historical  geographical  human and cultural-which binds us to this part of the Sahara. It also affects us because between our people and the brother people of the Sahara there is more than one reason for common feeling  more than one link of solidarity and common life. It is precisely because of this common past  this community of life and destiny that my Government  back in 1957  made the decolonization of this north-west part of the Sahara one of the fundamental objectives of its policy  but decolonization in all friendship and cooperation with the administering Power. This policy  decided on immediately following the formation of the first Mauritanian Government still under the colonial regime  has always been ours and we have made it known constantly and consistently.92.	Since our accession to independence and since our admission to the United Nations  we have never ceased  particularly from this rostrum  to make known our determination to safeguard the territorial integrity of our country and to consolidate the unity of our people. It is therefore for valid and legitimate reasons that independent Mauritania concerns itself and must concern itself primarily with the decolonization of the north-west part of the Sahara  known both as Rio de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra. But despite the legitimacy of our position  we have thought and continue to think that the settlement of this problem by peaceful means—that is to say  in understanding and co-operation-remains the path most in conformity not only with the principles and purposes of the Charter  but also with the interests of peace and stability in the African north-west subregion. It is our loyalty to these principles and objectives and our devotion to peace which naturally impelled us to accept the prospect for a peaceful solution through the implementation of the United Nations resolutions concerning this territory. That is why we hope tjiat the Spanish Government  within the framework of the good relations  old and new  which bind our two countries  will at last implement  as it has undertaken to do  the relevant provisions of these resolutions. Such an attitude on the part of the Spanish Government would further strengthen the traditional friendship and the bonds of every kind which exist not only between Spain and Mauritania  but between Spain and each of the other countries in our north-west African subregion.93.	For it was in the framework of this quest for a peaceful solution that my country had the honor to receive at Nouadhibou  in September of 1970  His Majesty Hassan II and Houari Boumediene. The three heads of State  from Algeria  Morocco and Mauritania  resolved to co-ordinate their efforts with a view to bringing Spain  through dialog  entente and co-operation  to implement the resolutions of the United Nations regarding the territory. As far as we are concerned  in Mauritania we remain true to the spirit of that conference of Nouadhibou and to the undertakings there entered into and we continue to believe that this attitude remains that of the other parties to the policy of co-operation and good neighborliness.94.	In other words  Spain  which in the past has conducted itself positively in the matter of decolonization  has every interest in heeding this spirit of understanding between the States of the subregion  and also in accepting the irreversible nature of the decolonization of the Sahara.95.	The continuance in Africa of this dangerous situation must not make us lose sight of another hotbed of tension  which is in the forefront of our concerns: namely  the Middle East crisis.96.	In the Middle East the Zionist authorities of Tel Aviv continue to trample underfoot the fundamental principles of the Charter and the decisions of our Organization. Their troops continue to enjoy the fruits of their cowardly aggression. The vast territories of the Arab Republic of Egypt  of the Syrian Arab Republic  of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  continue to suffer under the most barbaric military occupation. The criminal burning of the famous Al Aqsa mosque over two years ago aroused the indignation of almost all the world. This burning  for which the Zionist occupation authorities are entirely responsible  reminds the world of the very grave threat to the holy places of Islam  Christianity and Judaism represented by the completely illegal decision taken by the Zionist authorities regarding the annexation of the Arab part of the city of Jerusalem.97.	More than five years have elapsed since the Israeli aggression of June 1967. Since that date vast Arab territories have been occupied by an unscrupulous and inhumane army. The Arab population which has not been expelled is living an unendurable calvary. Houses are destroyed and fields are transformed into barracks or military bases. Colonies of Zionists are replacing Arab villages. A major campaign is under way in Europe and America to get the greatest possible number of Jewish immigrants to come and settle in the occupied Arab territories. This colonialist policy was denounced in Israel itself at a protest meeting-held at Kibbutz Kerem-Shalom  where it was emphasized that the Bedouin farmers had been expelled to make way for Jewish settlers. The writer- journalist Amos Kenan stated:""We must stop using these euphemisms such as 'creation of Jewish agricultural agglomerations' when the correct term is 'colonization'.""He continued:""If we want to stop the growth of this colonialist  militarist and Pharisaical Israel that we see taking form before our eyes  we must here and now declare to theleaders of our country that we will not fight in the next war which they are preparing with their own hands.""I repeat: this was not an Arab speaking; it was a distinguished Jewish writer and journalist  Amos Kenan.98.	Furthermore  in support of what Amos Kenan said  a member of the Central Committee of the Labor Party  Mrs. Shulamit Aloni  wrote the following in an article in Yediot Aharonot on 18 April 1972:""... Jewish farmers newly installed in the Gaza zone are employing in the fields Bedouins expelled from their lands.""She concluded: "". .. here we are confronted with a colonialist-type annexation"".99.	The barbarous action of the Israeli army is not confined to those violations of the jus gentium; on the contrary  Israel is still daily violating the air space of neighboring Arab countries. Its naval units regularly bombard peaceful Arab villages  killing innocent civilians. Its incursions across frontiers of this or that neighboring Arab country have become art everyday practice. This situation constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of justice  equality and territorial integrity of States and absolute respect for their sovereignty principles which are the life-blood of our Organization.100.	Everyone in this hall now knows that for the Zionists of Israel principles have no value except in so far as they can use them in the interest of their dark designs. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have applied the pertinent General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the Middle East question  particularly Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which they have nevertheless accepted. If the Tel Aviv authorities had the least respect for principles they would have co-operated with and assisted in the smooth functioning of Ambassador Jarring's mission instead of blocking it. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have accepted the mediation of the 10 members of the Committee of African Heads of State  members of a committee appointed by the OAU and chaired by the Head of State of Mauritania  then President of the OAU. If the authorities of Tel Aviv had the least respect for principles they would have permitted the United Nations commission appointed to investigate the lot of Arab prisoners to do its job.101.	It is clear to us all that Israel has the utmost contempt for the United Nations. As we have seen  Israel remains deaf to all appeals and all memoranda. Today the international community can no longer doubt that this state of affairs exist. Confronted with this situation  the international community must do everything possible to impel Israel  in the interests of international peace and security  to implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)-the only way of definitively and peacefully solving the question of the Middle East.102.	The legitimate liberation struggle carried on by the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland enjoys the active support of Mauritania and all peoples who love freedom and justice. The courage and self-sacrifice of the valiant Palestinian people  which is carrying on the liberation struggle in extremely difficult conditions  merit the admiration and encouragement of the international community. For too long there has been a desire to ignore the Palestinian people and to reduce them to inhabitants of refugee camps. Today they exist and are organized as a dynamic and embattled liberation movement. They are on their feet  weapons in hand  and have taken charge of their destiny. Henceforth it will therefore be futile to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict without their essential participation.103.	No authority-whatever it may be-is empowered to speak or deal on behalf of the Palestinian people. This responsibility will henceforth be incumbent on the liberation organization of Palestine alone.104.	In his speech to the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the Mauritanian Head of State said:""We all know that a final and durable solution cannot be found  whether voluntarily or not  if the Palestinian people are put into brackets. We must also cease using euphemisms and referring coyly to 'refugees'. The Palestinian people  chased from their lands by the Zionists who have taken over those lands by force  has a right to its existence. That people does exist even if this fundamental right  enshrined in the Charter which governs our life  is denied it. The Palestinian people  therefore  is courageously waging its fight for national liberation and refuses the role of accepting international charity and living in camps. There is no doubt whatever that its cause will triumph. Therefore  wisdom and realism demand that we should hasten the realization of that goal  which is inevitable and which will put an end to misery  bereavement  suffering and death  and bring about the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people."" [1877th meeting  para. 13. JThere is the only realistic solution  the only wise solution to the Palestinian tragedy. Any other approach will be doomed to failure. The Zionists must be convinced of this.105.	In a recent book Le pays du cerf  edited by Am Oved  Deputy Arie Eliat  member of the leadership of the Labour Party the Party in power draws up the most complete and most damning indictment of the official line  as follows:""An attempt to ignore this problem is vain  since it is impossible to pass over in silence such a tragedy  both human and national...; the Palestinian problem is at the source of the conflict; it is the root of the evil which has given rise to the Jewish-Arab hostilities. It is a festering and bleeding wound  from which their blood and ours flows.""Eliat adds: ""There will be no real peace  no end to the Israel-Arab conflict  until the Palestinian problem is solved.""106.	The Palestinian liberation movement  like any other liberation movement throughout the world  will continue by every means at its disposal the struggle imposed upon it  until it has recovered all its rights. The attempts of theZionists and their accomplices to alienate from that movement the sympathy of Western public opinion will not weaken its resolve; quite the contrary.107.	All those not blinded by racism and by the taste for domination  all those who believe in equality and fraternity among men  in the right of peoples to self-determination and to live in freedom  all those who cherish peace  all those who reject oppression and the law of the stronger  all those who are aware of the crimes that have been committed and are still being committed by the Israeli Zionists against the Palestinian people  all those will understand that the Palestinian patriots are completely' different from the image that the militarist Zionists of Israel give of them.108.	The terms ""terrorist"" and ""saboteur"" now used to describe those who are struggling in Africa and the Middle East for the independence of their countries and the dignity of their peoples cannot distort the reality they conceal. That is also the view of Deputy Arie Eliat  a member of Mrs. Meir's governing party. Eliat protests against those who describe the Palestinian fighters as ""bands of terrorists"" and he writes:""Israel should not ignore or underestimate the Palestinian armed resistance ... It must no longer under-estimate the morale and the courage of the Palestinian organizations...""And the author adds: ""... the Palestinian Arabs are our fiercest enemies  but that is no reason for not calling them by their name . ..""109.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania cannot but be indignant at the taking of innocent human lives  but it has the right and the duty to say that those who are truly responsible for such acts are those who  by their policy of domination and intolerance  by their policy of the massacre of civilian populations  the destruction of peaceful villages and the kidnapping of persons  those who by their policy of racism and colonialism lead peoples to despair and violence.110.	The United Nations  if it is to be realistic and consistent  must root out the evil or face the consequences.111.	This tragic and dangerous situation in Africa and in the Middle East must not make us forget the extremely grave situation prevailing in South-east Asia  where the peoples of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos are carrying on  with a determination never belied and a courage never equaled  a heroic struggle to secure respect for their sacred right to an independent  free and worthy life.112.	Despite the Paris negotiations and the hopes they have aroused  the Viet-Nam war becomes daily more barbaric  more murderous. The mining of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the stepping up of the indiscriminate bombing of its territory constitute a particularly grave escalation in the war which the United States is waging against the industrious Vietnamese people.113.	Confronted by this situation  in which a small people is in danger of being annihilated by the greatest Power in the world  which insists upon trying at all costs to impose its will on that people  the international community has the urgent duty to do everything possible to put an end to the war so that the people of Viet-Nam may at last live in peace.114.	However  peace will never be effective until the American troops and those of other foreign countries have accepted the peace proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in its statement of 11 September 1972.115.	I take particular pleasure here in reiterating to the valiant people of Viet-Nam the unreserved support and militant solidarity of the party  Government and people of Mauritania. We would like to take this opportunity of expressing our deep conviction that its just cause will inevitably triumph over all the obstacles in the path to its independence and freedom.116.	Our unfailing and unreserved support and solidarity go also to the people and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in the courageous and self-sacrificing struggle they are waging for the dignity and freedom of man in Viet-Nam.117.	The situation in Cambodia deserves  as much as any other  the attention of the international community.118.	In that country  foreign forces are obstinately op-posing the aspirations of the valiant and peaceful Khmer people  struggling for the triumph of their noble ideals of peace  justice  freedom and dignity.119.	The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  under the enlightened leadership of Prince Sihanouk  today controls over 80 per cent of the territory and the population of the country. It ought to have been possible to liberate the rest of the country by now  had it not been for the foreign forces in the country. Therefore  anyone can see where legitimacy lies  and who represents the will and aspirations of  if not the whole  then at least the over-whelming majority of the Khmer people.120.	The international community should draw the necessary lesson from this incontestable reality. For our part  we should like once again to assure the people and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia of our unfailing support and entire solidarity  at the same time expressing our deep conviction that their just struggle will surely triumph.121.	In regard to Korea  my country welcomes recent developments in relations between the South and the North of the country and earnestly hopes that the contacts already made will continue and will result in the peaceful reunification of the country. Nevertheless  it is clear that such reunification  so eagerly awaited by every Korean and by all who love peace and justice  is the exclusive concern of the Koreans themselves and  consequently can only be validly achieved after the cessation of all foreign interference in the affairs of Korea.122.	The United Nations has the right  and above all the duty  to assist in the course of the present session in creating conditions favorable for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. Independent reunification means without any foreign intervention  but peaceful reunification also through the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea  whose presence is not likely to create a peaceful climate in which the talks now taking place between the two parties can usefully proceed.123.	It was the duty of the General Assembly for it had the right and the opportunity  at this session-to help remove all the obstacles to the essential reunification of Korea. It could  at this session  have decided that the flag of the United Nations should no longer be used to camouflage the presence of foreign occupation troops in Korea. It could also have re-examined the mandate and the activities of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  since it is now clear that that Commission  far from promoting rapprochement  is a divisive element and also represents a heavy and unnecessary burden on the Organization's budget.124.	It is therefore exceedingly regrettable that the General Assembly has decided to postpone consideration of this important question of Korea to a later session. My delegation deeply regrets that the* General Assembly did not take the opportunity offered to it of contributing to the solution of a painful problem whose existence is due essentially to political and military intervention by the United Nations.125.	The concerns of my delegation are not confined to the grave problems I have just mentioned; far from it. We think that the problem of disarmament is very urgent  and its importance escapes no member of our Organization. The stockpiling and further improvement of weapons of mass destruction represent a grave danger to development and even to the survival of mankind. The vast sums devoted to armaments dangerously reduce the investments available for the economic and social progress of the developing countries. My delegation  for its part  will therefore support any international effort to bring about genuine general and complete disarmament.126.	If the grave problems I have mentioned are important  since they bear in themselves the seeds of conflict and therefore directly threaten international peace and security  if those grave problems require our attention and the search for solutions in conformity with the principles and purposes of our Charter and the aspirations of peoples  there are others  too  which must also be the object of our concern.127.	My delegation finds it impossible indeed to address this Assembly without referring to the grave economic and social problems with which the developing countries tragically find themselves confronted. It is regrettable that  on this fundamental level of mutual assistance which should characterize relations between peoples and nations  the co-operation of the wealthy countries is cruelly lacking.128.	The disappointing results of the third session of UNCTAD  the failure of the first United Nations Development Decade  the decision-making monopoly held by certain developed countries as regards the international monetary system-all this testifies to the absence of a political will to take the necessary measures to establish  in the interest of all Members  a genuine international economic co-operation profitable to all.129.	In such circumstances  with fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and constant increase in the prices of manufactured products  the already scandalous gap is continually widening.130.	Our Organization has the duty to redouble its efforts and to ensure that the rivalry among the great Powers is confined to the peaceful and elevating field of scientific research in the service of improving the lot of mankind.131.	As has been emphasized from this rostrum  close to $200 000 million are spent annually on armaments  whereas the flow of capital from the rich countries to the poor barely amounts to $10 000 million. This is a scandalous disparity that should not be tolerated in our day and age.132.	For its part  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is convinced that no country can truly triumph over under-development without having a vigorous grasp of the truly gigantic efforts and sacrifices required of both the nation and the individual.133.	That is why from this rostrum we wish to say that we are fully aware of the necessity of bilateral and multilateral assistance  but no less aware that we must first of all count on ourselves before counting on others. In this regard  Mauritania believes that the countries of the third world must not allow themselves to take the easy but dangerous way out  that of looking to foreign assistance for everything.134.	The industrialized countries  in both their own long-term interest and that of mankind as a whole  of course have the duty to work out a genuine international economic co-operation that would serve as a base for peace and understanding among peoples  and also as a powerful factor for a real implementation of the rights of man  whoever and wherever he may be. But as we have just said  such co-operation must be accompanied on our part by an awareness of the obligations of work and sacrifice.135.	With regard to the continent of Africa  the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania see in the rallying of countries around common objectives a potent means for speedily advancing their economic growth. We believe  therefore  in the usefulness of groupings at the subregional  regional and continental levels. Such groupings  through the markets they create  through the opportunity they provide for the member States to harmonize their development plans  represent an adaptable and useful framework the creation of which deserves to be encouraged by the United Nations. Such activity is perfectly consistent with the social and economic programs of our Organization.136.	Reference to the political and economic difficulties and the conflicts that sometimes darken the international horizon should not cause us to forget the positive role played by our Organization in the restoration and maintenance of peace in the world.137.	We express the sincere hope that we may see every Member State work for respect for the principles of the Charter and for application of the decisions taken by our Organization. Thus there will be a rebirth of the confidence now somewhat shaken-of peoples in this world Organization  for the greater good of all humanity."
"80",4880,"MUS",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I first of all congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the Assembly and assure you of the whole-hearted co-operation of my delegation and its Permanent Representative in the arduous task ahead of you.143.	I should also like to thank the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  for the way in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly.144.	I am very happy to see sitting on your right  Mr. President  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the new Secretary- General  who has already shown keen interest in the affairs of the United Nations by apprising himself personally of the views and aspirations of the peoples of the world. Mr. Secretary-General  may your endeavors bear fruit.145.	I do not think it would be out of place to pay a tribute to U Thant  who retired last December after years of untiring efforts to enhance the power and the prestige of this Assembly. He had always pursued his duties with utmost understanding and devotion.146.	Speaking at this rostrum at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations [1875th meeting]  I pointed out that the Organization had not fulfilled all the hopes and expectations which the poor  the weak and the disinherited of the earth had placed in it. While we recognize that it takes time to establish a new world-wide order of peace  justice and prosperity  to which we aspire  there has been good progress for peace and international agreements during the past months. The fact that the United States of America  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China have come nearer to one another augurs well for the world; and the dialogsbetween West and East Germany and the discussions between North and South Korea are no less significant.147.	I believe that we all share the Secretary-General's view that ""the United Nations ... remains the best long- term basis on which the international community as a whole can opt for survival  justice and progress"" and that ""in the long run there is no substitute for such an instrumentality"" [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 2]  I submit that the Member States should endeavor to make the United Nations more and more effective with each passing year and that it is incumbent on the General Assembly at each regular session to see to it that we progress steadily towards the goals that we have set for ourselves.148.	I should like now to come to a few specific points. There is no doubt that by restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China and by admitting five new States the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session took a decisive step towards ensuring conditions for the increased effectiveness of the United Nations.149.	Mauritius welcomes the initiative of Member States to request the General Assembly to consider the question of the admission of the new State of Bangladesh into the comity of nations. This question should not be tied up with any extraneous issue but should be considered by itself and on its own merits. Mauritius-like other countries-is of the view that with the admission of this important country to the United Nations most of the issues which are now pending between Pakistan and Bangladesh would be resolved.150.	In this connexion we are gratified that under the Simla Agreement of last July India and Pakistan have agreed  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  to renounce the use of force to settle their disputes. The normalization of relations between these two countries will contribute in a large measure to the solution of outstanding differences between Pakistan and Bangladesh. All three nations should be encouraged by the United Nations to restore conditions for a durable peace on the subcontinent. It is our view that it is not by keeping Bangladesh out of the United Nations family that we shall contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes that affect peace in South Asia.151.	I appeal to the People's Republic of China to look on the admission of Bangladesh with sympathy and generosity and not to pursue the path of ostracism  for through ostracism it was itself denied for over a quarter of a century its rightful place in this Organization.152.	Now I come to the very delicate issue which preoccupies the minds of most Governments at present. We have from time to time censured South Africa for its policy towards the black peoples of Africa; but to my mind South Africa's policy of apartheid and discrimination against our brothers and sisters in Africa has paled into insignificance against the recent action of Uganda  namely  the expulsion of Asians from that country and the expropriation of their property. We have all been put to shame  and in the name of humanity and peace I appeal to President Amin to search his own heart and reconsider the situation. Otherwise there will be no distinction between the policies adopted by Uganda and those adopted by South Africa. After all  South Africa has not dispossessed and expelled people because of their origin or race  thus bringing about the great hardships which would have followed such a policy of utter disregard of the principles on which this world Organization is based.153.	Without interfering in the internal policy of any State  I should like to deal now with another problem facing our brothers still struggling for their respective independence.154.	In our own lifetime peoples of all countries have fought two World Wars for justice and freedom and for equality of opportunity for all  and the last World War has now been behind us for over 27 years. Yet  despite the efforts of this great Organization and of the economically backward peoples of the world  there are still colonial Territories struggling for their rights. Four years ago I touched upon this problem in the Assembly [1765th meeting]  and we are still in a dark tunnel groping our way towards a dawn that we should like to see for each of these Territories.155.	There can be no justification today for a country to be under the domination of one colonial Power or another. I am not making an indictment of these Powers; my purpose today is to appeal to their conscience and to countries.represented in this Organization. I feel that the big Powers which are now holding large tracts of territories inhabited by other peoples should relinquish their hold over these territories  preserving  if they so wish  their economic  cultural and other ties with them.156.	Friendly Governments to which I am appealing must not take my remarks amiss  but rather search their own hearts to see whether there is any more justification whatsoever for keeping colonies in this decade. There are ugly aspects to these dominations of territories  for such territories are used as bases for the economic and political subversion of the neighboring countries which have become independent. If freedom per se cannot come to these countries  I again suggest to this Assembly that we .should revive the Trusteeship Council  under whose umbrella all the remaining Territories should live and be enabled to secure their independence at some future time; otherwise I see no hope for them. I know that I am touching on a very sensitive issue  but in the name of God and in the name of justice I ask the Powers concerned to pursue a policy of live and let live. I leave this problem to the representatives here for consideration and action.157.	I am glad that the subject of terrorism has been discussed. Let us hope that moderation and wisdom will bring about a better state of affairs. But it will be necessary in the first instance to define terrorism and to exclude from its connotations the freedom-fighters and liberation movements for which the Organization of African Unity has doubled its contribution this year. But after they have been excluded  to whom will terrorism refer? To the Arabs and the hijackers? We can see immediately how delicate the problem becomes. We all deplore and condemn terrorism  and I am glad that in his statement at the 2038th meeting Mr. William Rogers  Secretary of State of the United States  has defined at great length the several aspects of terrorism and given a new and  no doubt  acceptable orientation to this problem. I am convinced that all States will consider favorably the draft convention submitted by the United States for the prevention and punishment of certain acts of international terrorism [A/C. 6/L.850].158.	While on my way to the United Nations I had the opportunity of visiting the Middle East  and I am more than over convinced that it should be the first aim of this Assembly with the help of the super-Powers  which are really responsible for the tension in that part of the world-to bring about peace with honor. I am sure that it should be possible for the Federation of Arab Republics and other neighboring Arab countries to recognize the frontiers of Israel and live in peace with it  provided Israel withdraws from the territories it is occupying against the wishes of its neighbors. Otherwise  the peace of the world will continue to be threatened without any hope of reconciliation.159.	As I have just emphasized  the main concern of this Assembly should be to promote peace everywhere in the world  and it is heartening to think that the General Assembly at its last session declared that ""the Indian Ocean... is hereby designated for all time as a zone of peace"" [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and in that resolution called upon the great Powers and all other States concerned to enter into immediate consultations with each other with a view to halting the further escalation and expansion of their presence in the Indian Ocean and eliminating from the Indian Ocean all bases  military installations  the disposition of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and any manifestation of great Power military presence in the Indian Ocean conceived in the context of great Power rivalry.160.	In the framework of resolution 2832 (XXVI) containing the declaration  Mauritius will continue to cooperate with all other parties concerned in order to make the Indian Ocean a nuclear-free zone and an area of peace.161.	Further  considering the achievements of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  of which Mauritius is a proud member  we share the conviction of the Secretary- General that ""regional organizations have a vital role to play in any workable world order"" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 3]. Without divesting itself of its prerogatives with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  the United Nations should encourage regional organizations set up in accordance with the principles of the Charter to play their role as agencies of first resort to deal with local disputes and conflicts among Member States. The success achieved by OAU in this regard is important. At our last summit conference   we had occasion to witness once again peaceful methods of solving disputes by negotiation  mediation  conciliation and arbitration. As often as possible the regional organizations should be given the opportunity to maintain regional peace  in accordance with Article 52 of the Charter.162.	Turning now to the main requirement for lasting peace  namely  the question of general and complete disarmament  we have to note that the most decisive measures to end the arms race remain to be taken. Of course  we are gratified that agreements on partial measures of disarmament have been reached and that the talks on strategic arms limitations have been concluded successfully. But as long as there is no comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  we cannot genuinely speak of the possibility of peace. It may be that such a world disarmament conference as proposed by the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the answer. We believe that such a conference  if adequately prepared as suggested in resolution 2833 (XXVI)  will bring about the desired results  provided that the fundamental issues  including the stopping of all nuclear testing and the destruction of all existing nuclear weapons  are fully gone into beforehand.163.	If we consider all the problems of social and economic development facing two thirds of mankind  we realize how essential it is to take the bold steps that are called for in order to take measures for population control. Mauritius  as one of the countries plagued by a population explosion and consequent unemployment  is aware  perhaps more than most countries  that lack of economic development breeds social unrest which may result in serious internal conflicts. Accordingly  Mauritius .is engaged seriously in mobilizing all its population-controlling institutions under the aegis of the State. It is in this way that Mauritius hopes to provide increasing opportunities to its people for a better life  by removing obstacles to their economic and social progress.164.	Finally  it is our firm belief that the United Nations could best serve mankind if it could become the center for harmonizing human endeavors in the political  economic and social fields."
"81",4925,"MWI",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of my President  and therefore of the Government and the people of Malawi  I wish to associate myself with the warm tributes and sincere congratulations addressed to you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. From what we know of you  from what we have seen of your ability and from what we have witnessed of your exemplary performance in directing and supervising the debates and the discussions that have taken place so far  I can say with honesty that we could not have chosen a better President for this session than yourself. Naturally we are happy and delighted that a candidate whom we supported succeeded in being elected. The Malawi delegation will therefore continue to render every assistance and to co-operate with you in the very important task that lies before you.240.	I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  who has finished his term of office and returned to concentrate his many talents on the affairs of his great country  Indonesia. My delegation watched with appreciation and admiration the high standard of direction of last year's session  when Mr. Malik was its President. Once again I wish to pay our most sincere tribute to him for a good job very well done.241.	May I also take this opportunity to pay a further tribute to the former Secretary-General  U Thant  for his modesty  integrity and unassuming character which  among other things  greatly contributed to making him an ideal international civil servant. His devotion to duty and his relentless search for solutions to puzzling problems deserve our unreserved praise. Although he is no longer with us  I can assure him that we wish him continued health and much happiness in the years that follow his well-earned rest and retirement.242.	To the new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  we extend our heartfelt appreciation for his performance which  so far  has revealed that his ability and experience as a former diplomat and Foreign Minister of a medium-sized neutral country is  indeed  an added asset to his credentials. He can count on our co-operation and support in the discharge of his duties  as his country did when he was being considered for election.243.	We are meeting here in the Assembly to try and find solutions to the many problems facing the world today.The very fact that we are meeting and airing our views contributes very considerably to reaching a stage where different points of view can be listened to  considered  analyzed and decided upon. Clearly what decisions we arrive at in regard to the many problems we will discuss may represent no more than a consensus of views and ideas from different human beings exposed to different environments  circumstances  philosophies  and so on  all of which are factors influencing their thinking. It is in that context that all that I shall say with regard to the problems we are currently facing should be viewed.244.	Malawi is in southern Africa. It lives with the problems that are inherent in the political climate and situation that prevail in the region. What we are going to say here is not based on what we have heard and read from expatriate scholars or journalists who are regarded by most non-Africans as specialists or experts on African affairs  but on what we have seen and experienced.245.	The Government of the Republic of Malawi wishes to associate itself with Member States in expressing sincere appreciation for the manner in which the United Nations has continued to address itself to the chronic problems of southern Africa. It is a matter of deep concern to us that  despite those efforts  southern Africa  remains a problem area and  as such  a continual threat to international peace and security. As one of the countries that believe that international peace and security are necessary prerequisites for the economic development and social progress of any nation  Malawi will continue to exert its efforts towards the achievement of peace and the creation of a political climate that is conducive to economic development with its concomitant social progress and the resultant happiness for mankind.246.	We believe that  basically  the problems of southern Africa have been those of decolonization and racial discrimination. Although our Organization has discussed and debated those problems for the past two decades or so  so far little conspicuous success has been achieved that could directly be attributable to the rhetorical efforts of the United Nations. It was as a result of that realization that we began an earnest search for a possible solution that could be either supplementary or alternative to all previous attempts at resolving the problems in question.247.	Malawi's approach to the question of racial discrimination has not changed. We are as opposed to it as any Member State here present. However  we are convinced that the most effective and positive way to combat such policies is to seek changes in people who hold such attitudes by example  by persuasion and by social contacts  as well as by diplomatic exchanges. It is in an attempt to initiate those changes that Malawi has formulated and consistently followed the policy of contact  dialog and association with the rulers of southern Africa. Indeed  it was in that spirit that my President paid a State visit to the Republic of South Africa in August last year-a visit that was reciprocated in March this year.248.	During these visits much was discussed about what diplomats term ""matters of mutual interest"". What these matters were must be left to diplomatic discretion but suffice it to say that some aspects of them involved discussions of problems between black and white South Africans from all walks of life. We followed this method of approach because we feel that it is more effective to tell Governments about one's thinking concerning their policies through contact and quiet diplomacy than through mere rhetoric from a distance. Indeed  we are happy to say that  since we embarked on our policy of contact at different levels of the political and social strata  the racial situation in South Africa has shown some signs of slow but conspicuous change. This method may be slow in producing appreciable results  but we feel that it is more positive  more effective and more peaceful than are isolation  denunciation and force  which would lead to bitterness and long-lasting hatred among all the parties concerned.249.	On the future of the Trust Territory of South West Africa  we welcome the major break-through that has been made through the efforts of the Secretary-General in opening up a dialog with the Government of the Republic of South Africa. The fact that South Africa is willing to talk to representatives of the United Nations is in itself a positive development towards finding a solution to the problems of southern Africa. In wishing the Secretary- General's representative every success  we sincerely hope that a just and equitable solution will be found which will lead to the attainment of self-determination under a government acceptable to the majority of the people of that Territory.250.	As for the Portuguese Territories in Africa  Malawi has continued to have discussions with the Government of Portugal  particularly in regard to Mozambique. We believe that only by talking to Portugal  by persuading the Portuguese Government that its lasting interests lie in a Portuguese commonwealth formed of tree and inter-dependent sovereign States  and by proving that what happened in Brazil can easily be repeated in Africa can a greater impact be made with regard to changing the attitudes and mentality of Lisbon.251.	It is not without significance that some change of attitude is taking place in Portugal's colonial policy. I know that in some quarters the change has been interpreted as a token gesture to quell criticism. But our Organization would be doing the Government of Portugal an injustice if it did not recognize this change as a political step with great potentialities.252.	By ""changes""  I am referring to the recent constitutional legislation which the Government of Portugal has just promulgated in its Organic Law.  It has been learned that  according to these changes  the Portuguese Territories of Angola and Mozambique will no longer be referred to as ""provinces"" but as ""states""  which implies organic separation from metropolitan Portugal. In addition  legislatures are said to be in the process of being established in each State  with the membership of the legislatures to be drawn from all races of the local population. It is probably plausible to argue that for the first few years the elections to these legislatures may not meet the basic tenets of the principle of ""one man  one vote"". However  we hope that whatever qualitative standards Portugal may prescribe as a prerequisite for membership in the legislatures will be such that they will be able to be improved to a point where Angola and Mozambique can become cosmopolitan States in the style of Brazil   that people of all races can in those countries genuinely regard those States as their own.253.	On the question of Rhodesia  it is a matter of great concern that the deadlock still continues. But in reaffirming our conviction that the Rhodesian problem is primarily a British responsibility  we wish to express the hope that the door to negotiation will remain open and that all efforts will be made to induce the two sides to come to the conference table again.254.	There is no dispute among States Members of this Organization that what is required in the Rhodesian problem is a constitutional arrangement which will prove to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole and which will eventually lead to the attainment of democratic independence. There are those who still register their impatience because force has not been used by Britain against Rhodesia. They insist that only boycott  isolation and force will bring the Smith regime to its knees. In this regard  Malawi's position has.not changed. We are still opposed to the use of force against Rhodesia  both from a practical point of view and from a consideration of simple military logistics. Similarly  economic sanctions are not very effective unless they are comprehensive  mandatory  effectively supervised  and complied with by all States. Indeed  isolation and boycott have only helped to make the Smith regime more intransigent  and the victims of this have been mainly our African brothers.255.	Malawi believes that different tactics should now be used if the Rhodesian crisis is to be solved. We remain convinced that the responsibility of everyone who would like to see an acceptable solution to the Rhodesian crisis is to assist the British Government in every possible way in its search for constitutional changes acceptable to the majority of the Rhodesian people.256.	If we move from southern Africa and come to the next area to the north of us  we arrive in Uganda  where a lot has happened recently. While we respect the right of the Government of that country to initiate and execute its policies in the way it sees fit  I think most of us are agreed on the fact that the hardship and the distress now being experienced by Ugandan Asians holding British passports must be a matter of concern to humanity at large  in the context of some of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.257.	I am making this point because during the eight years that we have been privileged to be a Member of this Organization we have heard time and again that  while certain Governments in southern Africa have the right to legislate on matters that concern their countries and territories  the effect of their legislation and the practices arising therefrom are matters of concern to the whole world. Surely  what is unjustifiable in respect of one country must equally be unjustifiable in respect of any other country. If we in Africa are not to be accused of double standards  we must view world problems in an objective perspective and act accordingly. It is for this reason that we in Malawi did not consider it proper to comment on what the Government of Uganda found it necessary to do but  nevertheless  we found it desirable to open the door of our small country to some of the suffering members of humanity  so that the modest resources at our disposal could be utilized by some of those people who we believe  and sincerely believe  were in need of help.258.	We are also aware that problems that seem localized in nature have in reality great implications for international peace and security. The problems of the Middle East and South-east Asia  and the German question  are such that this Organization cannot afford to disregard them. In the Middle East  we would like to see Security Council resolution 242 (1967) implemented. This is because one of the most important aspects of that resolution is that the parties concerned were asked to establish contacts  under the auspices of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring  in order to achieve a peaceful and accepted settlement. Although these efforts by the Organization have so far not been as successful as originally anticipated  we feel that through contact it will be possible to come up with some acceptable compromise if the parties concerned avail themselves of Mr. Jarring's services. We are not underestimating the seriousness of the problem in the Middle East  but if the States in the area are to live in peace with each other  it is essential that contact and dialog be established between the two groups.259.	With regard to South-east Asia  Malawi has always maintained that the parties involved should together find ways and means of coming to acceptable answers to the problems that prevail in the area. We are pleased to note that the Paris peace talks on the question of Viet-Nam are still going on and that North and South Korea are slowly establishing contacts aimed at solving their mutual problems. It is our hope that these efforts will not have been made in vain  but that some solutions will be found to the almost chronic problems of the area. We are as anxious to see a solution to these problems as are the parties concerned.260.	The German question has been with us a long time now. However  this does not mean that the world has lost hope for an answer to the problem. It is gratifying to know that the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin was signed last year and was aimed at lessening the tensions created by a divided Berlin. We feel that this was a landmark agreement that may be a remarkable beginning towards finding answers not only to the question of Berlin and Germany  but also to some of the most pressing questions on the continent of Europe.261.	Last but not least  we appreciate all the efforts being made by some of the major Powers in an attempt to make this world a safe place for mankind. We hail with great enthusiasm the contacts established between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. We welcome the continued dialog between the Soviet Union and the United States. Indeed  we cannot remain indifferent to problems that affect the well-being of humanity.262.	These problems involve international peace and security. If the United Nations is to devote ample time to the problems of colonialism  discrimination and other conflicts  it should operate within a world that is relatively free from the dangers created by such things as the arms race. This is why my Government regards the question of the arms race and disarmament as one of the most important prerequisites for the maintenance of international peace and security. Thus Malawi has followed the progress of the various conferences and talks on disarmament with great interest.263.	Malawi would like to see progress in respect of bilateral as well as multilateral agreements leading towards complete disarmament. There is  indeed  a great need for more information and publicity regarding the question of disarmament so that Member nations could be kept informed about developments that are taking place. We are aware that  although this Organization and a few other well-intentioned nations are striving hard to reach an agreement over the question of disarmament  there are still obstacles to an acceptable agreement for complete disarmament. Malawi would like to appeal to those concerned to rethink the matter and to align themselves with the wishes of all mankind for the sake of peace and security  which would eventually create a favorable atmosphere for the implementation of measures dealing with the problems of disease  hunger and poverty. We believe in a policy of contact and dialog in order to achieve this end. Malawi believes that a settlement can be achieved not through the show of arms  but through peaceful coexistence for the maintenance of peace and security  the cardinal principles of this Organization.264.	Malawi has also noted with satisfaction the destruction of bacteriological weapons by some Member nations and hopes that many of those which own such dangerous and destructive weapons will do the same. It is hoped that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)] will help to make many nations destroy what they already have and completely stop the manufacture of such weapons.265.	We welcome the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union on the bilateral Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for the limitation of the production of certain arms and the destruction of at least some of the stockpiles of such dangerous weapons. We hope that reason will prevail. It is time that mankind began to be convinced of the futility of the existing arms race.266.	I should like to state also that Malawi would like to see the observance by all nations of the .Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. For this Treaty to be fully meaningful  all of its provisions must be fully implemented and the proliferation of nuclear weapons must stop. Greater efforts should be made towards the application of nuclear energy for peaceful uses as well as for the exploration of outer space for the benefit of all mankind.267.	Before I come to the end of my address  I want to thank the Assembly very much for its patience in listening to my country's views on some of the most pressing problems of our time. On my part  I wish to put on record that my delegation has been enriched by the deliberations and will continue to benefit from the views of representatives gathered here during this session. May the spirit of contact between nations and the communication of ideas practiced here in this Assembly find an echo in the world that we by our joint efforts represent!"
"82",4963,"MYS",27,1972,"Allow me at the outset to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by those before me and to offer my congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is an eloquent tribute not only to your great country  Poland  but also to your eminent personal qualities of statesmanship  which make you highly qualified for this high office. The task before us is a heavy and a responsible one. As you have eloquently stated  we are meeting at a time when ""signs of a good augury have appeared on the international horizon"" [2032nd meeting  para. 30]. Despite these encouraging signs there are still great problems facing us at this session. I am more than certain  however  that with your wise guidance the deliberations of this Assembly will be conducted briskly and effectively. Indeed  Mr. President  you have already set the tone and the tenor of our deliberations by your inspiring address at the opening of the session. May I therefore assure you of my delegation's utmost co-operation in the execution of your task.36.	I would like to take the opportunity here of expressing  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  our warm admiration and great appreciation to your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Mr. Adam Malik  whose patience  wisdom and statesmanship guided the historic twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion. The admirable manner in which Mr. Malik had conducted that difficult and historic twenty- sixth session is  indeed  a clear reflection of his qualities of statesmanship and leadership. I would just like to add that his untiring efforts and dedication to work towards peace  stability and progress in the region of South-East Asia exemplify further this quality of leadership of which Indonesia in particular and we in South-East Asia in general are justly proud.37.	May I also extend on behalf of my delegation our tribute to the Secretary-General  for whom this General Assembly session is his first full session since taking office. Mr. Waldheim  as we all known  is not new to the United Nations. His vast experience with this Organization should enable him to serve in his office with distinction. I would like to take this opportunity  therefore  to wish him every success in the execution of his immense task and to pledge our fullest co-operation with him in the performance of his duties and responsibilities.38.	We meet today in a world that is fast changing- changing amidst the visible signs of detente and reconciliation that have emboldened us to hope and believe that we are moving to a more stable order  and if I may add  to the beginning of a sober and rational international world order based on peace and co-operation.39.	Perhaps the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly was the turning-point. In the General Assembly at its last session and in this very hall we witnessed the seating of the People's Republic of China. And then  in quick succession  we witnessed the visit of the President of the United States of America to the People's Republic of China and  subsequently  to the"" Soviet Union. The Shanghai communique of 27 February 1972 and the declaration entitled ""Basic Principles of Relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" issued on 29 May 1972  at the end of the Moscow summit  had at once given us encouragement in our belief that we are indeed moving from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations  accommodation and of peaceful coexistence. This is indeed an encouraging and powerful trend  which holds the promise of a bright future for us and the generations after us.40.	But  as we are caught up in this general excitement  let us not be led into a state of over-optimism. Encouraged as we are  we are also aware that this trend could very well lead us into an era of big-Power collusion in which there would exist a multi-polar world broken up into spheres of influence and in which the fate of the smaller countries are decided not by themselves but by others. What we would like to see and what we seek is a non-polar world where universality of action and the process of democratization of the conduct of international relations prevail.41.	I do not want to sound pessimistic or over-optimistic  but the trend towards detente between and among the big Powers is certainly an important and encouraging one  encouraging because we see today that it is not impossible to resolve outstanding problems through consultations and negotiations. For the present the impact of this important and noteworthy aspect of the trend  however  is a healthy one and is already being felt throughout the world. I refer to the renewed efforts for the relaxation of tension between East and West Europe. Then there are the agreements to limit the stock of nuclear armaments and other logistic weapons signed by the United States and the Soviet Union  which no doubt have far-reaching implications  leading us to hope that the end of the armaments race is not too far ahead.42.	Of closer interest to us in Asia is the Simla Agreement reached between India and Pakistan  an understanding which  we hope  will move towards eliminating antagonism and confrontation from the Indian subcontinent.43.	And while on the subject of the Indian subcontinent  if I may be allowed a little deviation  that one of the problems which confront us is the acceptance of Bangladesh by the United Nations. We hope that at this session the principle of universality will be upheld and the problems in the way of Bangladesh's admission into the United Nations and into the world community will be overcome.44.	We welcomed and were also encouraged by the initial contacts made between North Korea and South Korea  and the Joint Communique issued on 4 July 1972 [A/8727  annex I] bears testimony to their desire to work towards the peaceful settlement of the problem in that important area.45.	Further  while I am addressing this Assembly  another historic occasion in this chain of events is taking place. I refer to the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to China which  we hope  will begin a new era in the relationship between the two countries and which will have far-reaching and  we hope  beneficial effects  particularly in our region of South-East Asia.46.	We see that bilateral contacts and dialog are already becoming accepted as one of the high points in our search for peace and stability  and it is the hope of my delegation that this significant trend will continue in the future. While we are concerned  and continue to concern ourselves  with problems that remain unsolved  problems that tend to endanger international peace and security  we should not  however  allow ourselves any action that would jeopardize efforts made by those concerned to solve their problems by themselves. Indeed  the only action that we may allow ourselves is that which would encourage further the present trend towards bilateral talks and negotiations.47.	The Government of Malaysia therefore welcomes this present development of the international scene. It is particularly meaningful to us in Malaysia and all the countries of South-East Asia.48.	I need not remind the Assembly that there is a tragic and devastating war raging in parts of South-East Asia. We in South-East Asia have been living with this war for over two decades. A generation has grown up in our parts for whom war has been accepted as the natural order of things and peace has been a complete stranger. However  we are not sitting idly. Encouraged by the present trend in international relations  we are ourselves working to speed the wheels of change towards peace in our area and are making proposals with the object of bringing about lasting peace and stability within our region.49.	You will recall that at the last session of the General Assembly my Prime Minister had at some length discussed the proposal for the neutralization of South-East Asia [1948th meeting]. Since that time Malaysia  in association with its neighbors the Kingdom of Thailand  the Republic of the Philippines  the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Singapore have worked closely towards bringing into reality the ideals and aspirations of this purpose.50.	Our determination and resolve in this endeavor finds its fullest expression in the Declaration issued by the meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN]  held at Kuala Lumpur on 27 November 1971. in which the five countries of the region declared their determination ""to exert initially necessary efforts to secure the recognition of  and respect for  South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers"".  By this modest beginning the five States of South-East Asia have  for the first time in recent years  boldly and imaginatively sought  through their own efforts  to bring home the ever-elusive dove of peace to our peoples. Whether our efforts will be reduced to nothing more than just an eternally dim and flickering hope or whether they become a catalyzing agent ushering in a peaceful era for South-East Asia depends to a very great extent on the willingness and resourcefulness with which we in the region grasp the full significance of this singularly unique opportunity  which the present pervasive climate of peaceful dialog and detente affords us  to initiate immediate and positive actions for our own security and well-being. The proposal for the neutralization of South-East Asia demonstrates the recognition by the States of South-East Asia of the importance which such an opportunity affords them for the creation of a viable and efficacious security arrangement for the region. It is an eloquent testimony of their strong involvement in the world-wide efforts towards creating the conditions for a better and more peaceful world and reflects our optimism and faith in this new world order which has yet to blossom to its fullest extent. We are secure in the thought that our proposal  which is so much in harmony with the spirit and the ideals which have motivated the many historic and epochal events of our time  will find easy acceptance and recognition by everyone who shares and cherishes these values.51.	In pursuance of the provisions of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration efforts have been and are being made to bring its contents to the attention of the non-signatory States of South-East Asia and to encourage them to associate themselves with the aspirations and objectives expressed therein. Initially a committee of senior officials of the countries members of ASEAN was appointed to study and consider what further necessary steps should be taken to bring about the realization of their objectives. The committee has already had its first meeting and will continue its studies with further meetings in future. Since the signing of the Declaration  the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries have met on several occasions for mutual discussion and an exchange of views on matters affecting the region. And it was at the last of such meetings  which was held in Manila from 14 to 16 July 1971  that the ASEAN countries agreed to request the Foreign Minister of Indonesia to take certain initiatives on their behalf which we hope could contribute towards a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict in Indochina.52.	All these initiatives that we in South-East Asia are at the moment undertaking could not have been possible had there not existed today a sense of regionalism  political cohesion and solidarity. The desire to co-operate in matters of common concern and to consult with each other and the need to work towards a common objective have been manifested in the formation of ASEAN  a regional organization indigenously initiated and inspired.53.	Through the co-operative and joint actions that I have exemplified we hope to create conditions for the attainment of peace and stability. Because in the final analysis international security is the sum total of the prospect for peace and security in each and every country  each and every region. Hie trend towards detente has therefore a considerable effect on us. Indeed we believe that the move towards detente should not be the monopoly of the super-Powers alone. It should be the property of us all who set high in value the attainment of global peace and stability.54.	While noteworthy and important developments are taking place on the political front  it is dismaying to find that this is not matched in the field of economic and social development. The picture we get here is one of gloom and pessimism. The world is still divided between the developing and developed countries. In this respect  it is still very much a bipolar world. Owing to the vast strides made by the developed countries in the technological and industrial fields the developed countries are far ahead of the developing countries and the gulf between them is ever widening. It is becoming increasingly clear  that the burden of the world's poverty is increasing rather than declining. Such a situation will not promote peace and stability  unless it be accompanied by economic and social progress as well.55.	The subject I am referring to is not a new one. It has been raised and will continue to be raised at every opportunity not only to demonstrate our concern and anxiety but also to bring home the point that such an unbalanced international growth will not be conducive to a stable world order. We therefore cannot continue to be apathetic or unresponsive to problems of the developing world  which is still facing mass poverty  unemployment and illiteracy -problems which appear to be intractable although we are now in the Second Development Decade. In addition to these problems  we are threatened by growing trade protectionism  when there is a need for expanding markets for the primary products and manufactures of developing countries  signifying the reluctance of richer nations to help the poorer. This reluctance has been reflected in the falling off of official development assistance to developing countries  thereby increasing their debt- servicing problems  which are becoming crucial  and it strikes at their national efforts for greater income distribution and the alleviation of poverty and mass unemployment.56.	The third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  held at Santiago in April and May 1972  was characterized by the unwillingness of the richer countries to face up to these problems and to commit themselves to the attainment of the aid targets laid down in the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)J  both in respect of the 1 per cent of gross national product volume target by each economically advanced country and in official development assistance flows of 0.7 per cent of gross national national product  which are now almost less than half their stated target. One of the goals and objectives of the Second Development Decade is the attainment of a 6 per cent average annual rate of growth in the gross product of the developing countries as a whole. However  this growth rate cannot be achieved if official development assistance continues to decline. I might point out here that three quarters of the world's resources go to one quarter of the world's population where per capital income income averages $US 1 000.57.	It might be appropriate to recall resolution 2880 (XXVI)  on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  which emphasizes the close connexion between the strengthening of international security and development and which calls on the United Nations to evolve a. concept of collective economic security designed to promote the sustained development and expansion of national economies.58.	In this context  in the interests of both the developed and the developing worlds  we look forward to a greater liberalization of trade  since that would accelerate expansion of international trade to the mutual benefit of the developed and developing nations. Only in this way -by a collective effort on the part of both developed and developing nations- can we all tread the path to collective economic security called for in resolution 2880 (XXVI). We are living in an interdependent world where what affects one affects the other. For the developed as well as the developing countries  the interest is mutual and the stake is common. If it has been possible to improve the political climate of the world after years of antagonism and mistrust  it is surely timely now for us to take stock of the economic scene and to look forward to an era of greater and more meaningful international economic co-operation between the developed and the developing worlds.59.	What is needed here is the political will on the part of the developed countries to come to the assistance of the developing countries  for their assistance is crucial in the International Development Strategy. I would not like to give the impression that the developing countries are seeking charity from the developed countries. What we are trying to achieve is the bringing about of a sound investment in global peace and progress consonant with the views and ideals of the United Nations Charter.60.	That we have arrived at an era of reconciliation and accommodation is timely as we have spent time long enough to arrive at an attitude of mind that we have today. Although we anticipate far-reaching consequences  I do not at this somewhat early stage entertain visions of a profound and immediate change for peace. For in the behavior of nations  as in man  antagonism  rivalries and competition will continue to remain a feature of life. What we must do is to blunt these features and minimize the threat to international peace and security. At the same time  I do not  however  minimize the golden opportunity that today's developments present to us. Our only course of action is to seize this opportunity and to build upon it a strong framework for peace and stability to prevail  a peace with progress and justice. Indeed  we believe the United Nations can guide the new changes in the international scene and lead it to the realization of the ideals of the Charter. This is an opportunity for us and for the United Nations. We cannot miss it. Towards these ends  my Government continues to pledge its sustained effort to play its part. These are the thoughts that are the uppermost concern of my Government  and despite my note of caution we look forward to that brighter future.61.	In conclusion  I wish to thank the Assembly for the patience and understanding with which it has listened to my remarks  lengthy though they may have been. But I do so with the humble hope that they will contribute in some small way towards the search for peace and security  which we all fervently aspire to attain."
"83",5036,"NER",27,1972,"President  may I be permitted first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Niger  to convey to you warm congratulations on the confidence placed in you and your country by your brilliant election to preside over the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your personal qualities and your long experience with international problems provide  in the opinion of my delegation  firm assurances of the fruitful development of our work.2.	May I be permitted also to associate my delegation and my country with the so well-deserved tributes that previous speakers have addressed to Mr. Adam Malik for the courtesy and efficiency with which he presided over our twenty-sixth session  which proved so delicate in so many respects.3.	I should also like to convey to the Secretary-General of the United Nations an expression of the confidence that the Government of Niger places in him. Since he was appointed to this high post he has demonstrated by his energy and his courageous initiatives that he intends to assume to the full his exceedingly difficult role.4.	Year after year we meet in this august Assembly with representatives of an ever-increasing number of nations. But year after year we find ourselves grappling again with the same serious problems that still have not been solved. What is even worse  some of the most burning questions  questions on which the peace of the world depends  do not appear on the agenda of our session.5.	Once again we must note the ineffectualness of the United Nations in an area considered as of primary importance by its founding fathers and affirmed in Article 1 of the Charter: that is  the area of the maintenance of international peace and security. Increasingly  this has appeared as the privileged preserve of the super-Powers. We must accept the evidence. Everywhere where there is no convergence of interests among the super-Powers disputes remain unsolved. That is a situation whose seriousness escapes no one. Thus  certain serious problems have been frozen for decades: here  large countries remain artificially divided in two; there  entire nations see themselves refused the right to self-determination or to the free choice of a government; elsewhere  cruel wars are raging with no end to them in sight.6.	During the past year  however  we have witnessed some encouraging signs. The two parties in Korea have sketched out a rapprochement  or at least a relaxation of tension. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have begun conversations. The Governments of India and Pakistan  despite a particularly painful dispute  have met together again. At the great-Power level  we have witnessed some events but we cannot yet estimate their implications. However  as of today we can congratulate ourselves on the arrangements concluded at Moscow on the limitation of strategic weapons. We would like to hope that this will come to represent a first step towards more general disarmament  which will relieve humanity from the specter of war and free for peaceful and constructive work the vast sums swallowed up each year in military expenditure in almost every country.7.	But these few signs of relaxation of tension cannot lead us to forget the troubled areas. In Viet-Nam  where last year we thought we saw a glimmering of hope for a peaceful settlement  the fighting resumed a few months ago  intensified beyond any level we had witnessed before  causing incredible destruction and human suffering. And we still do not see any end to this tragedy of a whole people  while the United Nations  for a whole series of reasons  hardly participates as effectively as could be desired in the efforts made in various quarters to achieve a negotiated solution.8.	Neither can we discern any gleam of hope in the Middle East. Last year  at this time  we hoped at least for a partial  temporary solution concerning traffic through the Suez Canal. Unfortunately  this feeble hope seems today to have been abandoned. The Jarring mission appears to have been compromised. Now it is absolutely essential to reactivate that mission or find some other approach likely to get the negotiations out of the impasse in which they are bogged down now.9.	Niger for its part abides by Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and considers that the great Powers should be in a position to impose its strict application  with all the desired guarantees for the establishment of an equitable and lasting peace. That is a responsibility which they cannot evade.10.	Niger is aware that it has always sought to maintain the best of relations with all the independent countries of the world  at least so long as others refrained from intervening in our domestic affairs.11.	What is more  President Diori Hamani has acquired the reputation of being an impartial and wise mediator and his action to restore harmony among the African States has been decisive on more than one occasion. Quite recently we had the pleasure of helping neighbors and brothers to clear up a painful misunderstanding which had developed between their Governments.12.	Moreover  we try to work as closely as possible with our African neighbors in order to pursue  by successive stages  the ideal of African unity. Whether this be within the framework of the Council of the Entente or in the wider framework of the African and Malagasy Common Organization [OCAMJ  or the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  Niger is convinced that it has chosen the path of realistic and brotherly co-operation. At this very moment it is seeking to create with its neighbors of West Africa  a large economic community which would be in a position to encourage the development of this vast geographic area by binding more closely together the nations that make up this region.13.	In North Africa  in Central Africa and in East Africa  similar groupings are emerging. We welcome these realistic events with hope and confidence.14.	It is with the same hope and the same confidence  and in the same spirit of essential solidarity  that my country  adding its voice to the already numerous voices of so many others  appeals with all its strength for the holding of a world conference on freedom of navigation and the common exploitation of resources of all sorts which lie on the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the territorial waters established by each State. It is in this way and this way alone that the land-locked countries will be able  injustice  to play their full role in international trade.15.	Unfortunately there is another vast region of our African continent  southern Africa  which is a matter of concern and scandal to us.16.	Although world public opinion is becoming increasingly sensitive to the problems of decolonization and racial discrimination  and although from time to time it has succeeded in imposing its will on international bodies  we are compelled to note that the Portuguese Government  the racist regime of Pretoria and the illegal Government of Southern Rhodesia have in no way altered their attitude and their policy. For more than a decade now despite innumerable debates  despite all the resolutions adopted by the Assembly on apartheid  on decolonization  on Rhodesia and on Namibia  these colonial Governments  which are the remnants of an era that we had thought long past  are flouting international public opinion and making a mockery of the United Nations community.17.	But it is obvious that this incredible arrogance  this permanent affront to international morality is made possible only by the culpable inertia of the big Powers  inertia which sometimes extends to complicity. There is no doubt in our mind that if the principal Western Powers  by common agreement  would withdraw their overt or covert support from these regimes and their support of Rhodesia is the most scandalous-they would quickly be brought to terms.18.	We call upon the great Powers to understand and to seize this historic moment and to cease their support of these anachronistic regimes  support which they justify by what are often fallacious arguments. We call upon them to find a solution to these painful problems. They have just been given a fine lesson in this sense by the World Council of Churches at its recent meeting in Utrechi. It decided to boycott companies and banks operating in South Africa  in Rhodesia and in the Portuguese colonies and has called upon all churches to support the appeal of the African Council of Rhodesia for the convening of a national convention in that country. We congratulate ourselves on these initiatives of this eminent international body  which enjoys vast moral prestige. In the long run  they will certainly not fail to have a decisive influence at least we should like to hope so-on the Governments on which in the final analysis the solution of these problems will depend.19.	The Government of Niger expects the South African Government to respect the resolutions of the United Nations  particularly that which set up a committee on the question of Namibia. It firmly expects that this committee will be set up without delay and that it will facilitate the access of the people of Namibia to full sovereignty in the shortest possible time.20.	As for the Portuguese Government  which stubbornly insists on pursuing its inhuman and anachronistic colonial policy  when will it understand  and when will its Western allies finally make it understand  that it is vain to try to hold back the inexorable course of history? The independence and accession to full sovereignty of Angola  of Guinea (Bissau) and Mozambique are inevitably inscribed in the records of the world's history. Any attempt to set back the date not only affronts the universal conscience but also submits the people of Angola themselves to the most criminal deception in its history.21.	With respect to Southern Rhodesia  my Government calls upon Great Britain to take the full measure of its responsibilities and to draw the necessary conclusions from the recent failure of the agreement concluded with the illegal regime of Ian Smith. It immediately became obvious that the terms of that agreement had been rejected by the vast majority of the population. To continue to close one's eyes to the state of affairs is tantamount to forcing the black majority to have recourse to violence as the only way out of this unjust situation.22.	Turning to the item inscribed in the agenda at the request of the Secretary-General  namely  international terrorism [item 92]  the Republic of Niger  while rejecting terrorism as a means of combat  believes that it must be defined very carefully in legal terms because we must not confuse terrorism with the legitimate struggle which people are waging  as an extreme solution  to conquer the rights of which they have been deprived.23.	Any effective measure should in our opinion strike at the roots of the evils known as armed struggle throughout the world  colonization and apartheid in Africa in a word desires for intolerance  hegemony and human passions.24.	Finally  in an area which is very dear to our hearts  our disappointment has been very great indeed. 1 refer to the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ which was held a few months ago in Santiago  Chile. Despite intensive preparations  despite the appeals and the warnings from all sides  uttered not only by the representatives of the poorer countries  but also by enlightened minds within the group of industrialized countries  that confrontation at the world level  which could have resulted in a global development strategy  ended in a thinly disguised failure.25.	None of the major claims of the developing countries was accepted: neither the commitment of the wealthier countries to devote a greater part of their gross national product to investments in the third world  nor the promise to associate the poorer countries more closely with far- reaching monetary decisions that affect them as much and even more than the developed countries  nor even the glimmerings of an organization of the trade in commodities which would halt the continuing deterioration of the terms of trade between the industrialized countries and the poor countries.26.	To what extremes  therefore  must the poor be reduced before the wealthier countries  suddenly enlightened as to their true interests  will finally agree to come to grips with these problems with all the urgency and seriousness that they require?27.	The only positive decision taken by the Santiago Conference was the selection of the 25 least favored countries which should receive preferential treatment. Since Niger was placed in this category some might tell us perhaps that we are ill-placed to complain about the results of the Conference. To this I would answer that it is our duty to speak in solidarity  in the name of all of the States members of the group of under-developed countries  since it is precisely because of a lack of solidarity that we have not succeeded in having our just claims recognized heretofore.28.	Those are the few brief thoughts that my Government instructed me to put before the General Assembly because  in Niger  despite the inevitable setbacks encountered along the way  our hope in the United Nations remains firmer and more resolute than ever."
"84",5081,"NGA",27,1972,"Mr. President  it is for me a pleasant duty to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your long experience in the service of your country  as well as your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat  eminently qualify you to discharge effectively the duties attendant upon your high office. The record of your service since the opening of this session has already justified the confidence reposed in you by the Members of our Organization.99.	I want also to place on record the Nigerian delegation's appreciation of the services rendered as President of the Assembly during the last year by Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  whose occupancy of the presidential chair not only did great credit to his own country but also enhanced Afro-Asian co-operation in tackling very explosive world crises and delicate situations in the General Assembly.100.	Permit me further to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on the energetic and efficient manner in which he has started to grapple with the heavy burden of his office.101.	Since the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly there have been some positive trends towards an improvement in the world situation. The era of detente  which was ushered in by increased contact between the super-Powers  is gradually lessening international tensions; the balance of terror which had formed the basis of the uneasy peace between these super-Powers and their allies is gradually giving place to a reconciliation of interests. The People's Republic of China  following the historic decision taken by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2758(XXVI)]  has assumed its legitimate place in the community of nations and its representative had the opportunity  only last month  of presiding over the most important organ of the United Nations  the Security Council. These developments  by reducing the dangers of global war  have made significant contributions to the maintenance of world peace and security  and the realization of the purposes and principles of the Organization.102.	However  we cannot pretend to be unaware of some of the problems which detente may create if we do not consciously guard against them. There will increasingly arise the tendency on the part of a few to see themselves as the sole arbiters of international peace and security and to seek solutions outside the United Nations to world problems which affect us all  great and small alike.103.	While the recent Moscow agreements  for instance  have been hailed as a positive step towards disarmament  there is no denying that their significance would have been even greater had they been worked out within the United Nations Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. We realize  of course  that even within that Committee the necessity for ""political realism""  to quote a common phrase  is increasingly being invoked as a justification for special privileges for some members  thus restricting the role of others.104.	The small  the medium-sized and the developing countries as a whole must seek active participation in the development of a world order in which all countries will be secure  and the interests of all peoples safeguarded. For us in Africa  the improvement in the world situation will be more meaningful if and when it brings the wind of change to the colonial and racial situation in Southern Africa. As far back as 1960  this Organization  by its resolution 1514 (XV)  committed itself to the total liberation of colonial Territories and the granting of self-determination to their peoples. Twelve years after this lofty commitment  and in spite of improvements in other areas of international concern  it is most regrettable that the situation in southern Africa has not changed.105.	The colonialist and minority regimes  firmly backed by some NATO powers and international capitalism  continue to suppress African freedom movements savagely  to ignore United Nations resolutions  and to promote subversion against countries which support the freedom movements.106.	The question of colonialism affects Africa more than any other part of the world  and the continued existence of colonialism in Africa is an infraction of our dignity as Africans and a threat to our national security and sovereignty. That is why we in Africa have had to take a lead in concerting international efforts against colonialism where- ever it exists and in giving substantial material and moral assistance to freedom movements.107.	To us  therefore  it is a matter of great disappointment that the dedication to the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) shown by the OAU has not been matched by whole-hearted support of it by some Members of the United Nations  because of their mistaken belief that their national interests would be adversely affected by the total implementation of that resolution. For example  only a few days ago  on Friday  29 September 1972  we witnessed a deplorable use of the veto by the United Kingdom to thwart the rightful aspirations of the peoples of Zimbabwe to independence and self-determination and to promote the selfish interests of the racist minority regime in that country.108.	If we are all committed to the liberation of peoples everywhere from the indignity implicit in colonialism and racism  we ought to be prepared to back our verbal commitments with material assistance. In this respect I must express Nigeria's sincere appreciation of the commitment of the foreign ministers of the non-aligned States to increase their material assistance to the liberation movements.109.	I should also draw attention with great appreciation to the decision of the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic countries to provide material assistance to those liberation movements. These offers of assistance  which positively demonstrate the support for human dignity given by theNordic peoples  as well as the non-aligned States  strengthen the determination of the freedom fighters. A tribute must also be paid to the socialist countries for the assistance they have continuously given to the cause of liberation in Africa.110.	What is required is that assistance be given on such a massive scale as to remove without further delay the forces of oppression and racism from the Territories of Angola  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau)  Zimbabwe and Namibia. For so long as the situation in those Territories remains as it is today so long as the peoples of those Territories are denied the opportunity to exercise their rights to independence and self-determination-there will remain an indelible blot on the record of the United Nations.111.	Just as disheartening as the lack of progress in decolonization is the continuation of the deplorable policy of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. In spite of the innumerable resolutions of this Organization  the South African Government has not relented in its pursuit of its racist policy. On the contrary  it has extended that policy more harshly to every aspect of national life in that country. Only recently the Prime Minister of South Africa embarked upon a program designed to cause confusion among black African countries and other mixed societies by advocating dialog with independent black African countries and by increasing facilities for black artists  sportsmen and other personalities to visit South Africa from the United States and similar countries. Even that feeble and insincere concession to world opinion has received a severe set-back through the increasing opposition of the ultra- racist  Fascist wing of his party. The continued failure of the moderate and liberal-minded section of the South African community to secure influential positions in the public life of that country is an indication that no amount of dialog or fraternization will deflect the obscurantist and inflexible advocates of apartheid from their course aimed at the total dehumanization of black people in that country and beyond. For we notice that the South African Government is now exporting apartheid to Zimbabwe  Namibia and the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique  which are still under Portuguese colonial domination.112.	Afraid that independent African countries north of the Zambezi river might become stable  developed and powerful  and thereby disprove the racist white-superiority concept which underpins the policy of apartheid  and concerned that such countries total abhorrence of the policy of apartheid would increasingly contribute to the overturn of the status quo in South Africa  the South African Government has now mounted a program of action designed to create and promote conspiracies  subversion and sabotage in several independent African countries.113.	During this session of the General Assembly the United Nations must look closely into areas in which new initiatives can be taken in the efforts to combat apartheid. It is no longer enough to condemn apartheid as being a crime against humanity. It is imperative that we organize more effectively and efficiently our resources to combat this curse to humanity. A start should be made in the more effective and efficient co-ordination of our multifarious activities against apartheid.114.	I wish to emphasize  as I have on other occasions  the point that Nigeria's policy towards the regimes in southern Africa is not based on racial considerations. It is motivated principally by our firm conviction that all men have the right to freedom and to economic and social justice. Apartheid is to us an abominable and repugnant State policy. If it were imposed on any other race in the world we should condemn it in equally strong terms. Above all our attitude is determined by our awareness that the entrenchment of racialist minority Governments in southern Africa is not only morally wrong but  more importantly  a threat to the sovereignty and security of independent African States and a primary source of international conflict.115.	The hope for bridging the economic gap between the developed and the developing countries which inspired the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  has not been borne out. It will be recalled that one of the basic assumptions of the Strategy is the existence in the developed countries of the political will necessary for the implementation of the measures expected of them in the Strategy.116.	The third session of UNCTAD  held in Santiago  Chile  earlier this year  provided the first opportunity to put to the test the existence or otherwise of this political will on the part of the developed countries. No one who attended that session had any doubt that the bottom had been knocked out of the Strategy. The reluctance of the developed countries to meet even the minimum requirements of the developing countries  as set out in the Declaration adopted at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries at Lima on 7 November 1971   was clearly shown on almost every problem discussed at the session. In the face of this apathy on the part of the advanced countries towards taking the basic step in the implementation of a Strategy which was carefully and elaborately worked out  can we in the third world continue to entrust our economic fortunes to others? It is the view of Nigeria that this situation calls for closer co-operation and deeper consultations among the developing countries to determine what their economic and trade relations with the developed countries should be. To append ourselves to economic units created basically for the development of Europe  for instance  cannot serve the long-term interest of countries on other continents struggling to find their feet. This is why Nigeria is committed to the promotion of regional economic units in Africa which would provide the much-needed co-operation for the rapid development of the continent. The All-Africa Trade Fair held in Nairobi  Kenya  early this year demonstrated the vast potentialities of intra-African trade. But let me hasten to add that Nigeria hopes that the development of regional economic groups will promote  rather than restrict  a free flow of goods and services among all countries.117.	The issues relating to the law of the sea are bound to assume great proportions during this session of the General Assembly in view of our decision at the twenty-fifth session to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 [resolution 2750 C (XXV)]. Naturally  as a coastal State and as a developing country  Nigeria has a special interest in the proposed conference for two reasons: first is the question of our security; second is the link between the exploitation of the resources of the sea and of the sea-bed and our economic development. Not having participated in the First and Second Conferences on the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively  Nigeria will want to take this opportunity to ensure that its vital interests are protected even while helping to facilitate international commerce and scientific research for the peaceful exploitation of the sea-bed. It is  therefore  my view that the time spent by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction in preparing an exhaustive list of subjects for discussion at the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea has not been wasted. It is a matter for discussion whether in fact sufficient preparatory work will have been done by the end of this year to enable us to convene the conference as scheduled  if we are to avoid the fiasco of the 1960 Conference. Patience and careful planning are indispensable to achieving our aim of elaborating generally acceptable regimes for the sea.118.	Just as the Charter of the United Nations is in principle based on the sovereign equality of all its Members  so also must membership in the Security Council and other committees of the United Nations be based on principles which recognize and accommodate ever-changing world attitudes. As the membership of the Organization has increased more than twofold since its inception  it is necessary  in the view of my Government  to readjust the composition of the principal organ concerned with peace and security; for there is no denying the fact that the effectiveness of the Security Council in fulfilling its role cannot be disassociated from its representative character. It is arguable whether or not it is wise in present-day circumstances to continue to maintain a privileged position for those countries which in accordance with Article 23  paragraph 1  of the Charter have permanent seats on the Council and exercise a veto power over its decisions. Basically  the conditions prevalent at the time of the designation of those permanent members no longer apply today  and democratization of our Organization should ideally apply to the Security Council as well. Bearing in mind  however  the present climate of opinion among those permanent members  whose concurrence is necessary for withdrawing their privileges  it may be more realistic to think in terms of the expansion of the system of permanent membership to include representatives from those regions in the world which are at present excluded from permanent membership: for instance  Asia  Africa and Latin America. In any case  Nigeria believes that the need exists for some modest increase in the over-all membership of the Security Council to provide fairer representation of the various geographical regions in our Organization.119.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be ominous and confused. Various attempts and encouraging movements towards a peaceful solution  or negotiations and contacts with a view to seeking areas of possible accommodation in the interest of peace  continue to be frustrated by the intransigence of some of the parties to the dispute  and their encouragement  for narrow selfish reasons  by some of the big Powers supporting various interests and nations in the area. For us in Nigeria  Security Council resolution 242(1967) still represents the best basis for movement towards settlement and a lasting and just peace in the area.120.	The initiative taken last year by the OAU  in which my Head of State participated  was to assist in the attainment of this objective. The OAU's inability to record complete success was due  in my opinion  to the legalistic interpretation by the parties of the wording of Security Council resolution 242(1967). May we on this occasion appeal to the parties to take another conciliatory look at that resolution  for it takes full account of the interests of all the parties to this tragic dispute? It is essential that all parties in the area commit themselves to a peaceful settlement.121.	The issue of terrorism  which has loomed so large during the current session  should be seen in its proper perspective. The unfortunate impression has been created  particularly by the Western press  that Arab and African States are opposed to a discussion of the issue  which  we are told by the supporters of the item [item 92]  has created panic in the minds of a section of the international community. Yet  it is now clear  after the preliminary exchange of views  both in the General Committee and in plenary meetings  that the hesitation expressed on the need for a clear definition of the term ""terrorism"" in the context in which it is to be discussed is wholly justified. For  if not put in its proper context  the discussion can easily degenerate into a total condemnation of the means of implementing principles which are enshrined in the Charter and have been reiterated in innumerable decisions and resolutions of this Organization.122.	No responsible Government or person would condone acts perpetrated by individuals against innocent persons for their own personal gain or for emotional satisfaction. However  we are painfully aware that  in pursuance of ideals enshrined in our Charter  it has become necessary for some persons and organizations to adopt violent methods where all avenues of peaceful settlement have been barred. The exercise of self-determination and independence has been recognized by the United Nations as the inalienable right of all peoples. Yet we see these rights being denied to millions of people in southern Africa by the reign of terror imposed on them by colonialist and racialist regimes. If such peoples resort to armed force  Nigeria cannot be party to a discussion that will seek to equate their activities with those of common criminals who hijack planes and kidnap diplomats and other important people to extort financial benefits for themselves. Certainly  we in Africa  who have endured the most vicious forms of terrorism  have no inhibition in exposing to the world what some of our brothers still suffer. What we cannot condone is to give those who organize the worst forms of terror an opportunity to condemn as terrorists the victims of their inhumanity. It must be made clear that peoples struggling to liberate themselves from oppression and exploitation have the right to use all methods at their disposal  including force. This fact has been recognized by our Organization. We should therefore not leave the door wide open for reactionary regimes to erode the glorious struggles of these peoples. In this regard we hope that the Sixth Committee  to which the item has now been referred  will give a clear definition that will be generally acceptable to Members of this Organization.123.	I wish to conclude this statement by affirming our abiding faith in the ability of the United Nations to contribute to the consolidation of peace among all nations  to the enhancement of justice in all lands and to the promotion of the economic and social progress of all the peoples of the world. We  in Nigeria  shall continue to do all that we can to contribute to the improvement of the methods of the United Nations  in the hope that the Organization will decide to proceed with greater vigor to tackle its unfinished business: to assert the dignity of the human being and his right to self-determination and the enjoyment of freedom  to press forward the elimination of apartheid  to bring about the elimination of force as an instrument for settling disputes  and to concert international co-operation for the furtherance of the economic and social progress of peoples everywhere. This  we believe  will enhance the possibilities of the United Nations to flourish for the good of mankind."
"85",5127,"NIC",27,1972,"We are gratified to see that you  Sir  have been appointed President of the twenty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly. You represent a noble country known for its heroic deeds and its fascinating history  Poland  which for so many reasons deserves universal respect.160.	It is a highly significant coincidence that you succeed Mr. Adam Malik of the Republic of Indonesia  a distinguished and outstanding statesman who also represented a heroic and noble country which achieved its integration and freedom through a decisive struggle for these lofty national values.161.	Both of you remind us of one of the outstanding responsibilities of this Organization in the world of today. When efficiency and magnitude seem to coincide with the need felt by great interests to minimize the meaning of frontiers as an obstruction  our Organization should try to ensure that these frontiers maintain their most significant value: that people need not sacrifice their sons for the world to recognize their right to individuality  to self- determination in terms of their own will and to the free expression of it; for all to participate in deciding and forging the common good; and for all to possess and enjoy fully the heritage which is rightfully theirs by nature and in terms of the mandate of international equity.162.	We also wish to convey our congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose enlightened talent and devotion to the United Nations are singularly outstanding. What could be termed activity and fervor in Trygve Lie  heroism and abnegation in Dag Hammarskjold  caution and foresight in U Thant  is pragmatic and corrective flexibility in Kurt Waldheim.163.	Mr. Waldheim's energetic administrative ability leads us to trust that the financial difficulties of the United Nations will be solved and the root-causes of them will be dealt with  not merely adjusted in their effects. His high-level policy  which is very much in accord with that of personal contacts to which the great statesmen and world leaders have had recourse with such promising success during this second half of the twentieth century  should be viewed as a happy augury for the strengthening of the deliberative capacity of our Organization  since what the United Nations Secretary-General represents will be all the more meaningful and important the more he is identified with the aspirations of peoples expressed here by their lawful delegations.164.	Although on some previous occasions I have had the honor of addressing the Assembly  this is the first time that I do so as the representative of a bipartisan Government in my country headed by a National Government Junta. On the decision of the National Constituent Assembly  the Junta began to govern the destinies of Nicaragua on 1 May 1972  at the end of the period for which General Anastasio Somoza was elected by popular vote.165.	The National Government Junta  made up of General Roberto Martinez Lacayo  Mr. Fernando Agiiero Rocha and Mr. Alfonso Lovo Cordero  represents the union of the two largest political blocs in our country  and that body brings together the broadest majority which could support a government in Nicaragua  and they have joined their wills to promote greater national progress through the civilized means of law  peace and labour.166.	In repeating  on behalf of the National Government Junta  this devotion to peace and justice  nothing gives me more satisfaction than to be able to do so using the very same words as our predecessor in the Government. When President Anastasio Somoza addressed this Assembly in 1970. he said the following:""Nicaragua reiterates and renews its faith in the United Nations. Nicaragua  a country that loves peace  that respects the rights of others  applies norms of international conduct in conformity with the law  and is proud to follow a policy that complies with the Charter of this world Organization. In keeping with these principles  we have peacefully settled our conflicts in the past and scrupulously complied with the decisions of the International Court of Justice. In accordance with the fundamental principles of our political constitution  we have established respect for human rights and for the principle of the self-determination of peoples  and we have proscribed war as an instrument of justice."" [1881st meeting  para. 156.]167.	This philosophy has been the link which has joined together all the administrations of the past 40 years  ever since  at the beginning of the 1930s  Nicaragua decided gradually to strengthen by means of peace and concord its sovereignty as a free nation of the world and its domestic progress based on free enterprise and equitable participation. The same philosophy governs the competitiveness and social responsibility of its private enterprise  the moderation and good judgment of its labor organizations  the respect for the law and public service demonstrated by its armed forces  and the admirable support for civilized means of action felt by the vast majority of its people.168.	The National Government Junta represents the flowering of this heritage of enlightened civil understanding  a lively and calm will for peaceful transformation  described by us as the most encouraging political phenomenon we have achieved  and one which will enable the nation to continue its tradition of peace and law so that the twentieth century may open the door to hope for the future.169.	With this deep-rooted conviction of the importance and stability of what I represent  I shall venture to explain the general lines of the policies which the National Government Junta of my country wishes to bring to this august Assembly.170.	With the principle that ""development is the new name for peace""  Pope John XXIII launched his militant ecumenical message for all men of goodwill. His scheme for economic and social development cannot be conceived without a national order which reveals distributive justice as the foundation of the development of the human person. The second element in this scheme for development is that development cannot be imposed by the criteria of one sector  nor be the subject of secret or dogmatic decisions; on the contrary  it must be the responsibility of human reason in which all the sectors concerned must receive the full impact of the representative democracy of a civil government.171.	But this concept of development also implies a framework of international justice  which will make it possible for it to be carried out. It would serve little to impose on States the responsibility to promote the development of its citizens in an internal order of equitable participation in the benefits of labor; it would serve little to bring about the transformation  even the peaceful transformation  of internal institutions if the energies of the universal movements of the spirit were not to make themselves responsible also for the creation of an international order which ensures that the necessary and sufficient conditions exist so that the heritage of nature  where labor must function  and the patrimony of civilization and culture  with which labor is performed  are equitably distributed among the peoples.172.	The corner-stone of any order should be to ensure the fundamental freedoms and rights of the human person  enabling States to make them effective.173.	To be free from hunger  poverty  disease and ignorance is a fundamental and inherent right of the human person throughout the planet. But hunger  poverty  disease and ignorance are not self-generated by peoples—at least not by those who do not have the right or the possibility of self-determination to avoid them.174.	It is essential for States to have not only an equitable participation in the fruits of nature and the resources of civilization  but also the security of self-determination so that international trade will not put a brake on the achievement of their fundamental freedoms and rights but will stimulate the effective co-operation and solidarity which will make these possible.175.	The thesis of the legal equality of States is upheld by the principle of self-determination and the outlawing of means of violence as a tool of international policy. If one of the first fundamental conditions is lacking  it is not possible to ensure the purity of the results  therefore an international order that is not founded on these concepts is historically untenable. For such reasons the National Government Junta of Nicaragua has decisively supported from the outset the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to include in the agenda for this session the item on international terrorism.176.	For many years now Nicaragua has firmly condemned all forms of violence. The Nicaraguan Government has paid increasing attention to the problem of international terrorism since this is a manifestation of the use of violence in relations between peoples which can only have a negative impact on international peace and security and an adverse effect on all other normal relations between nations.177.	Witliin a State citizens have the right to institutionalize the means which will ensure for them the exercise of their freedom of expression. In the international order this right should be extended to States and groups of human beings so that they can manifest their free will through rational means worthy of the civilization which we so proudly regard as our own.J178.	The Government of Nicaragua  with the broad and decisive support of its citizens  has condemned violence  including terrorism  as a means of expression and political action within the frontiers of the country. We have always considered it our legal obligation to ensure for our citizens all the peaceful forms of expressing approval or disagree ment  because this maintains internal peace and the evolution of our institutions  as minimum essential conditions for a development policy.179.	It has been and will continue to be the official policy of the Government of Nicaragua to cope with any violent situation  including terrorism  with the normal means of safeguarding public order  including punishments by recourse to common law which are consecrated by traditional practice and which are rooted in the principles of morality of our people.180.	Nicaragua deeply regrets that in some countries and  certain regions of the world there has been a resurgence of the tragedy of terrorism. Our people and Government share the concern of other countries to find an adequate solution and we most firmly support the thesis that attention to this problem cannot be delayed. To discuss economic  social  political or any other form of relations has no meaning if we are not first certain that these relations can be decided upon and put into practice in an order free from terror. This is the essential prerequisite for free participation. Convinced of the urgency of this item and the high priority it deserves  the Government of my country is none the less aware of the difficulties that its solution presents at the international level.181.	A great deal of wisdom will have to be brought to bear not only in the study of the causes of terrorism but also in foreseeing the effects of the measures which may be decided upon to combat it. Urgency should not lead us to undue haste.182.	The essential prerequisite is to strengthen internal conditions which will ensure freedom of expression for citizens  as well as an international climate which at this stage of internationalization will ensure equal freedom for every State or human group. But the international responsibility of States cannot be made so extreme as to jeopardize the legal equality among them or to make unjust international coercion a means to suppress a just human aspiration.183.	The National Government Junta of Nicaragua considers it indispensable in this connexion to ensure that an institution such as the right of asylum  which is considered to be so equitable by the peoples of Latin America  should not be undermined since it is one of the safest practices to enable man to preserve and exercise his political rights. Beyond question  we consider the right of asylum should be not only maintained  but strengthened so that it is not used as an accomplice to acts which are repugnant to morality and contrary to the legal order.184.	The foregoing is completely in line with the traditions and practices of the inter-American community  to whose ideals the National Government Junta restates its devotion and its determination' to strengthen them by all means within its scope.185.	Latin America cannot forget  nor does it forget what was achieved in the nineteenth century when it freed itself completely from the colonial ties which bound its destinies to the will of certain European States. This gesture has been many times repeated since the end of the Second World War  when hundreds of millions of men of other continents succeeded in organizing themselves in scores of States  whose voice today swells the voice of freedom within this great world Organization. But neither can it forget what it had to suffer and go through before  during and after this task of emancipation  because of an international law and practices had been established not to strengthen the possibilities of freedom for peoples but  rather  to foster more or less deliberate schemes of colonization.186.	Accordingly  since the dawn of its independent life it has expressed itself firmly among the Latin American countries for a spirit of renovation of international law and practice to make them more compatible with the evolution of the just aspirations of peoples  which should find in international law the best safeguard of these aspirations  as the only means of escaping the deadly  vicious circle of violence.187.	One of the manifestations of this Latin American tendency has been to establish institutions and promote principles which foster freedom for the human person and international co-operation and solidarity and to give the law and practices among States fundamental objective criteria which lessen the importance of procedural formalities and the subjectivism to which so much recourse was had under ancient law  to the detriment of justified aspirations.188.	With these efforts to make the law objective  revising  readjusting and correcting it  which are so encouragingly characteristic of the peoples of our America  the Government and people of Nicaragua for many years have been deeply identified  and now  on behalf of the National Government Junta  I am pleased to repeat and reiterate our traditional and enthusiastic identification with them.189.	We human beings have used the land  the sea and the air to establish common ties of relationship to the extent that technology has made it possible to make use of them  and civilization has given some purpose and meaning to their use. On land  on the sea and in the air are written the value and importance of our virtues and the history of our defects and passions. Yet we must confess that in each one of these elements human reason has left indelible traces of its lofty designs and its irreversible course of progress.190.	Since Nicaragua is geographically a-maritime country  with two oceans and vast water resources which constitute the largest portion of its national patrimony  its statesmen and people have paid increasing attention to the future of its water resources policy.191.	We feel particularly close to all the countries of the Caribbean region  almost all of which are characterized by the limited size of their land and by the relative scarcity of natural resources on that land.192.	And it is therefore to be understood as natural that we have a common interest in studying the tendencies in the world community as regards recognition of the vital rights we have in the peaceful and rational use of the resources of the continental shelf and the adjacent seas  which is a fair and  for that matter  rational compensation for the limitations imposed upon us by the limited area of land and our peaceful vocation as States.193.	May I be permitted to restate here the firm decision of the National Government Junta and the people of Nicaragua to maintain their support for peaceful and civilized forms of international relations  to contribute by all possible means to making international law objective and readjusting it so that it will ensure to all peoples that their vital heritage is not unduly and unfairly affected  and to participate to the extent that circumstances permit in the enrichment of international relations within principles of equity and common well-being.194.	Nicaragua has identified itself with the countries which are trying  through a wise law of the sea  to strengthen the peaceful aspirations of mankind and the possibility for peoples to use marine resources equitably to finance their development.195.	Nicaragua joined with its brother countries of Latin America very early to initiate formally the movement  which is now universal  to readjust and reform the law of the sea which was started to deal with the resources of the sea for a distance not less than 200 miles from the coast  and the renewable and non-renewable resources of the total area of the continental shelf under the old concept of territoriality. From theory we went to practice. In view of our geographic location and the peculiar nature of our submarine zones  in 1950 we included the following article as Article 5 in our Political Constitution:""The national territory extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the Republic of Honduras to the Republic of Costa Rica. It includes  in addition: the adjacent islands  the subsoil  the territorial waters  the continental shelf  the submerged lands  the air space and the stratosphere.""Boundaries that are not yet determined shall be fixed by treaty and law.""196.	When studies of the renewable resources of the sea or in relation to its shelf led to their first results  it was observed that the life cycle of certain exploitable species went on at depths beyond the 200 meter isobath  thus giving greater strength to the claim for the total area of the shelf  and to distances far beyond 3  6 or 12 miles of the territorial sea  which had commonly been accepted.197.	Pending an international agreement which would solve the problem of the breadth of the. territorial sea  but in complete agreement with the economic and ecological reasons which called for a greater breadth of the sea for their renewable resources  the Government of Nicaragua proclaimed  in 1965  a national fisheries zone of 200 nautical miles in breadth  which was immediately placed under a rationally increasing regime of exploitation  and  using foreign capital and technology  national  foreign and mixed companies were set up  all of which were offered sound guarantees under our national legislation.198.	In July 1972  together with the countries of the Caribbean  Nicaragua participated in the formulation of the Santo Domingo Declaration [A/8721  annex I  sect. 2J. In that Declaration  the countries of this region  which is unique in that it unites instead of dividing its riparian countries  strengthened the basic principles of the first conceptions of renewing the law of the sea.199.	Beyond doubt  the countries of the Caribbean declared their will to have a territorial sea of 12 miles  but they confirmed the sovereign rights of the coastal States over the continental shelf which extended their territory under the sea and over an area of the sea which would not exceed 200 miles in breadth and would encompass the territorial sea and the patrimonial sea of each riparian State as a legitimate aspiration capable of becoming a criterion of universal application.200.	It is a happy coincidence of thought that exists between the countries of the Caribbean Sea because even though there were problems of delimitation between two or more States a solution would be found in accordance with the peaceful procedures provided in the Charter of the United Nations.201.	What is essential is that in the Santo Domingo Declaration a significant group of Latin American States set down for the law of the sea rules which are as objective as is possible in the present stage of development of social sciences  economic relations and the natural environment  the art of politics and the administration of development.202.	It has been the will of all the peoples of the world to place those problems for study and care with the United Nations so that  in the third international conference of plenipotentiaries on the law of the sea  the problems could be settled in conventions  which would do justice to all peoples  without discrimination or favoritism. This planet has been created and exists for all in accordance with our Christian tradition  and it is the minds of men  and their right conscience  which is responsible for ensuring that this common heritage is shared among all.203.	As this task is difficult  my Government is ready to participate in all the preliminary phases and in the third conference itself  and if necessary  it would be prepared to support a movement designed to make the sea-bed Committee and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea an organization of the United Nations similar to UNCTAD  specializing in the various aspects of ocean space and the relations which could be established through that area to increase solidarity and co-operation among peoples  dealing with such complicated and important items with the prudence and care which the interests of all the nations of the world counsel in these circumstances.204.	It is here that we must see the necessary function of the United Nations to exercise moral leadership among the organizations mankind has set up to bring to reality and give concrete form to its aspirations in rational institutions which will ensure the well-being and progress of all the peoples of the world.205.	But we cannot forget that this moral function will be obstructed and perhaps even wiped out if we do not grant our Organization the regulatory capacity and perhaps the power to settle moral problems in positive law of objective force which it should have.206.	The agenda to be dealt with at this session of the Assembly tells us that there are very serious problems that must cease to be subjects of speculation and reasoning  and pass on to the stage of specific regulation which will ensure peace and development for all nations. International wealth  like individual wealth  must have social responsibilities which should be defined unequivocally. The objective principles which strengthen the physical heritage of nations should be met with parallel principles which are equally objective to strengthen the equality of opportunity of all States and peoples and their equal access to this other aspect of our heritage  which is our cultural heritage. The benefits of science  technology and culture  the work of countless generations of mankind  are part of the common heritage to which all people should have access for their evolution and progress.207.	Nicaragua is firmly determined to contribute to those aspects with concrete deeds of law and the action of its Government  so that international wealth and the technology of mankind  can join with the capacities of the Nicaraguan people rationally to exploit its physical patrimony. For some time Nicaragua has been enacting beneficial legislation so that foreign capital and technology can suitably participate in national development.208.	Our Government has paid particular attention to the multiple relationships with our brother countries of Central America. For us they are part and parcel of our own nature and we know that we share their brotherly feelings. For some years we have been integrated into the Central American Common Market  which represents our best security for development. Since we have almost come of age  we find it necessary to make adaptations which the five brother countries are looking for with great determination  certain as we are that our words of union should be reflected in action.209.	Nicaragua wishes to express its confidence in its brothers of Central America  once more offering them its broadest co-operation in the search for common action for the benefit and progress of all.210.	We have set up incipient but valuable ties with neighboring countries outside the Central American area and we are open to alternative proposals from multinational or bilateral companies for the rational exploitation of our continental shelf and our seas with all countries  principally with those of the Caribbean Sea which are our sisters in destiny  needs and aspirations.211.	We believe that we thereby contribute effectively to the aspirations of mankind as reflected in the Charter  which has guided us since 1945 and which imposed on us certain moral obligations which gradually have been assuming the form of regulations and laws among nations. Its functioning and adaptation to the changing conditions of the world require not only the exertion of intellectual effort  but also the expenditure of material resources. We agree with the aspiration of the Government of the United States of America in setting a lower limit than the present one for the maximum participation of a single country in the financing of our Organization. We believe that this aspiration coincides effectively with the need that the United Nations in its functioning should not depend on the will of a single State. None the less  it is our obligation to point out that the developing countries  with their declining participation in international trade  their increasing burden of external debt and their urgent need to finance internal development programs  cannot forthwith assume the weight of an excessive increase in their regular contributions. We trust that some formula will be worked out so that other States that are more developed will accept the new burdens  while the general progress of the world will enable the developing countries to participate more fully in the set financial contributions which are required for the functioning of our Organization.212.	In all that I have said here in terms of the general lines of the policy followed by the National Government Junta of Nicaragua  there is only the most fervent faith that my country and its Government have in this Organization as a moral beacon and the seedbed of positive law in which peoples that love peace should cement their hopes for the future.213.	The United Nations cannot fail to meet this imperative task with which it has been entrusted by history. Let vs not be discouraged by the magnitude of the task because  as there is a breath of reason  it will be the flame which will ignite the will to succeed."
"86",5173,"NLD",27,1972,"Mr. President  the twenty-seventh annual session of the General Assembly having been placed under your presidency  it is my pleasure to congratulate you  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  upon your unanimous election to your high office. We salute in you  Sir  not only an eminent representative from a country with which the Netherlands shared war-time experiences -a Polish division took part in the liberation of the Netherlands in the last part of the Second World War- but also a prominent representative of another medium-sized European Power actively engaged in the search for ways and means of promoting a political detente in our part of the world.2.	I should be remiss if I did not pay a tribute  on behalf of the Netherlands delegation  to Mr. Adam Malik  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  who presided over our previous annual session with all the courtesy  forbearance  grace and sagacity that characterize the Indonesian people.3.	It is also my pleasant duty to address a personal word of welcome to the Secretary-General and to Under-Secretary-General Morse  both of whom are gracing the podium for the first time.4.	Although I am speaking exclusively on behalf of the Netherlands  and not on behalf of the European community  I stress the European accent of my views  firstly because I do not wish to approach the problems before this Assembly from a purely national standpoint and  secondly  because at this moment the Netherlands has the privilege of presiding over the Council of Ministers of the European Community. The part of the world to which my country belongs is undergoing significant economic and political changes-not that we are without economic difficulties. Inflation  stagnation  unemployment all these evils beset us from time to time. Their effect should not be under-estimated  but I feel confident that in due course and through a better common effort we shall overcome them.In general the Common Market has proved to be of great benefit to its members; there will be  and there can be  no way back.5.	This morning we were delighted to learn the results of the Danish referendum. The enlargement of the European Community by three new partners  which in our opinion constitutes a break-through of importance not only to us but to the world as a whole  is more limited in scope than we in the Netherlands had hoped. The doors to the Community remain open to democratic countries interested in admission and willing to subscribe to the treaties. The greater European Community as it is to be constituted soon will comprise more than 250 million people with  in general  a very high level of economic and social development  with a vast commercial  industrial  scientific  educational and technological potential  with an outgoing interest in the rest of the world  and with no political or military axes to grind. The harmonization of foreign policies among the European partners will develop as time goes on  and thus enable Europe to play an effective and constructive role in the world. We are approaching this political co-operation pragmatically  but the prospects  in the light of our experiences  look promising.6.	Europe does not want to isolate itself from the world as a whole; nor do we want to become a new super-Power. What we do want is to develop our responsibilities  both towards our own peoples and towards other countries and  more particularly  towards the developing world. You may safely assume that the European Common Market will play an ever more important part in global co-operation for economic development. In this connexion I may point out that the Council of Ministers of the Community  together with the European Commission  last week devoted an extensive discussion  for the first time  to the attitude of the Common Market towards development co-operation.7.	Europe  of course  is more than the countries of the European Community. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AI8701/Add.l] the Secretary-General has pointed out the developments toward detente on the continent of Europe. We the members of the European Community and its prospective members  as well as our other friends and allies  welcome this development. We are convinced of the need for co-operation between Western and Eastern Europe. Preparations for the convening of a conference on security and co-operation in Europe are getting under way. I hope that in the course of this year it will be possible to start the multilateral preparatory talks which are necessary to ascertain whether the conference can yield tangible results-whether  in other words  the conference will enhance and increase security and trust for all parties concerned  both for individual countries within the present alliances and between the groupings as a whole. In harmony with the conference on European security and co-operation there will be the need for negotiations on mutual balanced force reductions. Indeed  without the complement of a mutual reduction of forces a conference on European security would make no sense.8.	My Government is looking forward to a positive outcome of all these negotiations  which may result in growing economic  scientific  technological and cultural co-operation. Most important of all  I hope that they will lead to a greater understanding among all the peoples of Europe  who  in our view  must be assured of freedom of movement and of a free exchange of information and ideas.9.	But again  even the whole of Europe does not live in isolation. Europe is only a part of the world  and we Europeans have to play our role and to assume our responsibilities in a global context. For the Netherlands three points are essential. In the first place manifestations of violence must be curbed  both on the level of States and on the level of individuals and groups; in the second place the forces of justice  reason and moderation must be strengthened by world-wide co-operation through the United Nations in all its facets; and in the third place the forces of economic and social growth must be regulated in order to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and improved standards of living in the world. I should like to elaborate on these three points.10.	In the case of Governments  the curbing of the means of violence in the first place implies arms control and disarmament. The Netherlands takes an active part in the disarmament deliberations in Geneva; we know that results can be attained only after long and patient discussions. The framework of disarmament talks is now under discussion. We may reform the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  we may have a world disarmament conference  we may choose any other suitable framework  but it has now become essential that the principal Powers  especially the five nuclear Powers  the permanent members of the Security Council  should participate in those discussions.11.	In the field of disarmament I wish to emphasize  once again  the importance of concluding an agreement for the cessation of underground nuclear-weapon tests. During the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly the Netherlands delegation expressed the hope that such an agreement might be reached within a year. I deeply regret that those hopes have not materialized. With regard to the question of on-site inspection  the rapid progress of seismology and the sophistication of its technology point towards increasing possibilities for control by national means. I therefore call upon the Powers concerned to take account of this development in order to achieve the comprehensive ban which  in our view  is long overdue. At the same time I repeat our urgent plea to all nuclear-weapon Powers to stop testing in all environments.12.	Concern about the nuclear arms race should not blind us to the urgency of reducing conventional arms as well. The accumulation and the proliferation of conventional armaments create and increase tensions in many parts of the world and divert resources from the promotion of social and economic goals. In this connexion I want to express  in particular  our concern about the increasing trade  including the second-hand trade  in conventional weapons and military equipment. It is extremely difficult to come to grips with this problem  because many aspects political and economic are involved. Nevertheless  I should like to appeal to supplying  trading and receiving countries to consider entering into consultations with a view to finding ways of stemming this alarming development.13.	The problems of curbing violence confront us inevitably with the remaining conflicts in the world. The Middle East  for instance  still presents a bleak picture  in spite of the praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General  his Special Representative  Ambassador Jarring  and many others. The Netherlands Government remains profoundly interested in a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and in the search for an equitable and mutually acceptable solution.14.	In our view  neither criminal acts such as the Munich outrage nor military retaliatory actions can advance the search for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. In general terms I wish to emphasize the urgent need for the prevention of acts of international terrorism  wherever they occur. I am grateful to the Secretary-General for his initiative to discuss this subject during the session of this Assembly. In the last few years we have tackled one aspect of terrorism  namely  the hijacking of airplanes. The Netherlands has ratified the Tokyo Convention  and the ratification procedure for the Conventions of Montreal and The Hague  is well under way. We urge other Governments to speed up  too  their ratification procedures. When studying measures against terrorism in its different forms  we will have to look  too  at the underlying causes  and the possibilities of eliminating them. We will have to look at the whole problem  without political bias and in the spirit of a common effort to stop the wanton killing of human beings and the resulting deterioration of international relations. In this spirit my delegation will give its full support to the search for a sensible solution of this intricate problem.15.	The second point -after dealing with the forces of violence- I mentioned as being essential for the United Nations is the strengthening of the forces of justice  reason and moderation. This  of course  involves the actual functioning of the United Nations. Here I must say that  as in many other countries  elections will be held in the Netherlands before long. As in any democratic country  controversies on many issues are rampant. However  there is no controversy in the Netherlands about the question of support of the United Nations. Therefore I know that I am on safe ground when I pledge  on behalf of the Netherlands people  our unrelenting support for strengthening the structures of world-wide co-operation. An arresting subject of further study in this context might be  in the Netherlands view  the modernization  adaptation and improvement of the process of international legislation.16.	One hundred and thirty two nations are now represented in this Assembly and we hope that in the near future others may join us in order to turn the principle of universality into reality. Different traditions  varying systems of government and diverging opinions on the problems before the world are guiding us. This remains the inescapable basis of reality in our Organization and this reflects on its effectiveness. We in the Netherlands do not believe that the resulting problems can be solved by a general revision of the Charter. We may adapt Articles of the Charter  whenever circumstances warrant it  but the Charter as a whole must stand as long as the political world situation remains essentially unchanged. To make our Organization more efficient we might devise better conference techniques. Moreover  we might for instance look into the desirability of keeping the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in some form of permanent session to meet the demands of our times.17.	Last year I advocated the optimal use of the resources and talents available to the United Nations in the Secretariat. The top of the Secretariat has now undergone changes. I wish to assure the Secretary-General that he may always count on the support and the understanding of my Government in his efforts to streamline the Secretariat and to raise its level of competence wherever feasible. One aspect of strengthening the role of the United Nations is  in my opinion  a more effective policy of information on the work done by the United Nations family on all levels.18.	How do we see the role of the Secretary-General in this whole context? Briefly  my Government looks at the Secretary-General's office in the following light. The Secretary-General is the servant of an Organization of 132 Member States and  in questions of security  the servant of the Security Council. In these matters he has little freedom of action or room for maneuvering. This point is illustrated by the unresolved question of peace-keeping operations. In April of this year the Netherlands made some suggestions in order to try to bridge the differences between those who would like to stress an independent role for the Secretary-General and those who stressed the preponderance of the Security Council for all aspects of those operations. In principle we subscribe to the preponderance of the Security Council  but at the same time we think that a workable way out can be found without infringing principles.19.	In peace-keeping operations the Secretary-General can  in our view  have only limited responsibilities.20.	However  that is one side of the picture. The other side is that the Secretary-General of the United Nations  because of his function  has an independent responsibility to speak up and to try to initiate action whenever  in his opinion  great humanitarian problems are involved. I completely agree with the following words used by Mr. Waldheim in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:""No matter what criticisms or setbacks may arise  the unwritten moral responsibility which every Secretary- General bears does not allow him to turn a blind eye when innocent civilian lives are placed in jeopardy on a large scale. [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 4.]21.	My Government is profoundly concerned over the increasing violation of human rights and the resulting human suffering in various parts of the world. It would be unforgivable if the international community allowed cruelty  terror and other infringements of human rights to go by without comment.22.	Therefore  the General Assembly will also have to discuss  once again and with even more insistence  the policy of apartheid in South Africa and the problem of decolonization which still besets the continent of Africa. Progress towards the elimination of apartheid is essential for peaceful development. A meaningful dialog to this end would be of particular importance for the promotion of a solution deemed urgent and indispensable by the world community. As to the decolonization of the few remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in Africa  my delegation fears that  irrespective of the right of self-determination to which all peoples are entitled under the Charter  further refusals by the Government of Portugal to embark on constructive planning for eventual decolonization will inevitably play into the hands of the forces of violence.23.	Coming now to the third point which we see as vital for the role of the Netherlands in the United Nations  I wish to speak on the subject of regulating the forces of economic and social growth in the world  of achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity among the peoples of the world and greater possibilities for human well-being  or and here I would refer to the terminology used by the Foreign Minister of Brazil of achieving a system of collective economic security  an idea which deserves further consideration and study.24.	Two years have passed since the adoption by the General Assembly of the International Development Strategy for The Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] and today doubts have arisen over the prospects of realizing the objectives and the targets of the Strategy  as a result of the expected shortfall in official development assistance in relation to the targets set in the Strategy. There is  however  no reason to dismiss the Strategy or to lose faith in the Second Development Decade.25.	On the contrary  the Strategy was in fact drafted as a dynamic instrument  adaptable to new circumstances and to change  and it was recognized from the outset that periodic review and adjustment would be required. Thus  while the basic objectives and philosophy of the Strategy  as a new framework for world-wide economic co-operation based on freely accepted rights and duties of States  remain unchanged  the need is now clearly felt for enlarging its contents and for adjusting it to a number of new elements which have emerged since its adoption.26.	I refer in the first place to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  which has confronted the United Nations system and its Member nations with a new dimension of economic growth and co-operation  namely  with the imperative need to preserve and enhance the human environment. The Conference and its results were in themselves a milestone in the history of the United Nations  to the extent that the United Nations system proved its capacity to tackle new and vital problems  to devise new machinery for dealing with these problems and to integrate this dimension of economic development into the already existing broader framework of United Nations objectives and activities. Stockholm  however  was a beginning; the Development Strategy adopted in 1970 did not sufficiently take into account the problems of the human environment  and it has now become necessary to set new objectives for the preservation and enhancement of the human environment  relating them  in particular  to the economic development of developing countries.27.	A second new element emerged at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  which met at Santiago in April and May and which projected a new vision of the world-wide interdependence between monetary problems and the problems of the economic development of the developing nations and of the structure of international trade. In this field  too  the International Development Strategy needs elaboration and adjustment. A most important new element in development is the deeply rooted problem of mass poverty in developing countries and its traditional attributes: unemployment  malnutrition  slums  lack of minimum hygiene  lack of education and glaring inequalities in standards of living. The Committee for Development Planning and  last week  Mr. de Seynes  the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs  and Mr. McNamara  the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  have brought this new conceptual context to the attention of the world. They have recommended that both developing and developed countries and international organizations take a bold approach in tackling this problem and they have thus replaced the traditional statistical approach of per capita growth by a new concept which places human well-being in all its aspects in the center of development policy. There is an urgent necessity to integrate the concept of mass poverty and unemployment into the Development Strategy and to try to set objectives and  if possible  targets for its elimination.28.	In addition to those three new elements  I wish to mention the progress which has recently been made in deepening our understanding of and our possibilities for drafting policies with regard to the problem of the least developed countries and the relationship between growth  prosperity and population. In respect of the least developed countries UNCTAD at its third session adopted important recommendations and it may be necessary also in this field to rethink some of the concepts embodied in the development Strategy.29.	With regard to population  it is encouraging to note that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities is expanding its activities. For 1974  that is to say  one year before the mid-term review and appraisal  it is expected that the World Population Year and the World Population Conference  1974  will enable us to deepen our understanding of the highly complicated  and at the same time delicate  problem of population. In our view  it is essential that we should increase our understanding and our capacity to deal with the problem in relation to development  both at the national and at the international levels.30.	Last  but not least  there remains the inescapable fact that official development assistance is expected to fall short of the target set in the Strategy. As I pointed out  the International Development Strategy was drafted as a dynamic instrument and it recognized  from the outset  the need for review and appraisal. The United Nations system is fortunate to have now at its disposal the broad framework of a machinery for review and appraisal which will enable it to adjust the Strategy to the new trends and new facts which I have just mentioned. This adaptation will perhaps have to lead to new objectives and targets for the fulfillment of the aims of the Strategy or the reaffirmation of accepted targets  and it is therefore of the utmost importance that individual Governments and all the organs of the United Nations family alike prepare themselves thoroughly for the first experimental review and appraisal  to take place in 1973  and particularly for the mid-term review of 1975.31.	The United Nations and its affiliated organizations have in recent years assumed new tasks and new activities and  as a result  the United Nations structure and the co-ordination between its different organs have become increasingly complicated. It therefore seems desirable to us that  parallel to the review and appraisal of the basic concepts and objectives of the International Development Strategy  a review should be undertaken of the institutional structure of the United Nations. This review should be carried out against the background of the provisions of the Charter which have assigned to the Economic and Social Council a central  policy-making and co-ordinating role as well as against the background of subsequent General Assembly decisions setting up new organs like UNCTAD  the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.32.	I have tried to explain how my country approaches the important problems before this Assembly. I have stressed the development of the responsibilities of the European Powers  not only among themselves  but also to other countries and  in particular  to the developing part of the world. This is not an exclusive responsibility of a few. The development towards a world community is  and has to be  a common effort of all countries represented in this hall.33.	May God's blessing rest on this joint effort and on the labors of this session!"
"87",5264,"NPL",27,1972,"Mr. President  I take it to be my honour and privilege to convey the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra  for the success of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.166.	I should like to convey  on behalf of my delegation  our most sincere congratulations to you on your election as President of the General Assembly. I take particular pleasure in noting that in electing you as the President  the Assembly has given a befitting recognition and honor to you as a distinguished statesman of a great country. I have no doubt  Mr. President  that you will bring to bear on the work of the Assembly the benefits of your vast knowledge and experience  which you have gained in your varied and distinguished career. I would like to extend  on behalf of my delegation  the assurances of our full co-operation to you in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities.167.	My delegation would like to put on record our deep appreciation of the distinguished services of the outgoing President of the Assembly  Mr. Adam Malik  who has discharged his functions as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly in a most exemplary manner.168.	This year we come to the United Nations with renewed hopes for peace. It has been a year of positive and promising developments in the area of international relations.169.	Of all the recent developments  the termination of the policy of isolation directed against China carried great importance. With a land mass of continental proportion and a society of 800 million people  resurgent and vibrant  China is destined to play a major role in the international relations of our time. Last year we had the honor to welcome the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. While the participation of China has considerably increased the effectiveness of the United Nations  its presence has made the Organization nearly universal.170.	President Nixon's visit to China  unprecedented as it was in itself  has opened great vistas of fruitful co-operation and meaningful understanding between these two great countries. It has demonstrated in unmistakable terms the possibility of a rapprochement which would greatly help relax tension in the world. My delegation sincerely hopes that in their own interest  as well as in the interest of the world as a whole  both China and the United States will continue to pursue their search for better understanding and co-operation.171.	Similarly  the detente now seen between the Soviet Union and the United States is a welcome development President Nixon's recent visit to the Soviet Union and his meetings with the top leaders of that country has undoubtedly brought the two countries closer in approach and understanding. The various bilateral agreements signed in Moscow have opened a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. The co-operation in the fields of science and technology  and in the areas of environmental protection  space exploration and commercial relations would certainly help to create an atmosphere of positive co-operation  trust and understanding between these two countries.111. Of all the agreements recently signed in Moscow  the one resulting from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems  is of great importance. Though in itself it may not have far-reaching consequences  it marks a new breakthrough in disarmament negotiations. A good beginning has been made in Moscow and I hope that this will* lead to serious attempts by both sides to reach a further understanding towards a more secure and peaceful world.173. My delegation is happy to note that the political climate of Europe continues to grow better. The ratification by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany of its treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland are encouraging steps towards a real and lasting peace between the countries of East and West Europe. Two world wars during the first half of this century erupted from Europe. It is only appropriate that the European nations should strive hard to resolve their differences and work for the attainment of a durable peace.174.	The atmosphere of detente has spread to other parts of the world as well. The futility of the policy of confrontation and conflict is now being increasingly realized. The leaders of India and Pakistan met recently in Simla to discuss mutual problems. Though there could not be complete agreement on many outstanding issues  their decision to resolve problems through negotiation in the future is no small achievement  bearing in mind the recent war. We welcome these developments. We are most hopeful that our two neighbors will soon be able to find a peaceful solution to their problems.175.	We also welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan  Mr. Tanaka  to the People's Republic of China. We hope this meeting between Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Chou Enlai will help bring these two great countries closer in understanding and future co-operation.176.	We are following with great interest the direct talks between North and South Korea though they are still in a preliminary phase. Nepal has always believed that  in solving bilateral problems  there is no better substitute for direct talks. We hope that the two parts of Korea will bring a mutually agreeable solution to the problem.177.	Despite these healthy developments in other parts of the world  the situation in the Middle East and the war in Viet-Nam remain matters of serious concern. It has been almost five years since Security Council resolution 242 (1967) was adopted. This resolution provides a reasonable basis for the settlement of the Middle East problem. But despite the efforts of Mr. Gunnar Jarring  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and the talks between the representatives of the big Powers  the resolution still remains unimplemented and the situation is as volcanic as it was before. The recent developments in the Middle East make us all the more conscious of the dangers in the area. We have the framework; the only thing required is to accept and execute it. In the absence of direct talks between the parties  we hope that they will co-operate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his renewed bid to bring them together to resolve the stalemate.178.	It is unfortunate that the war in Viet-Nam still continues unabated. The sorrow and suffering caused by this war have been a source of great concern to all of us. We have always maintained that all the parties concerned in Indochina must find a political solution for the settlement of their problems through peaceful negotiations and that the countries of Indochina should be able to decide their ultimate destiny without any foreign intervention. We feel that the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the soil of Viet-Nam is the first necessary step towards the settlement of the Vietnamese problem.179.	This decade has also been designated as the Dis-armament Decade by the General Assembly [resolution 2602 (XXIV)]. The armaments race is both the cause and consequence of the atmosphere of fear and distrust that we now have in the world. It is essential to halt the arms race to restore the climate of confidence and co-operation among nations. Furthermore  the armaments build-up has not only increased capacity for destruction but it has also diverted resources that could have been used for the promotion of peace and the acceleration of development around the world.180.	Motivated by these basic conclusions  the United Nations has from the beginning attached great importance to the problem of disarmament. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the recent Convention on the Prohibition of Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction are no small achievements. However  these steps  important as they may be  are far from adequate. They have a built-in weakness. The test-ban Treaty cannot be effective unless it is comprehensive as well as universal. The Convention cannot be considered complete so long as it does not include chemical weapons as well. We hope that the major Powers  which have the resources and responsibility  will take a meaningful initiative for the regulation and reduction of armaments which  as we all know  by their very existence dangerously threaten peace and security  promote discord and distrust among nations and retard the development process of the world as a whole.181.	In our view  the only sure path leading to the conditions necessary for lasting peace among nations is through complete disarmament. We have always supported the idea of convening a world disarmament conference in which all nations  including divided nations  should be invited to participate.182.	In southern Africa there still remain the vestiges of the colonial anachronism and the manifestation of the worst form of racial discrimination. In Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau)  the Portuguese authorities have been ruthless in suppressing the legitimate aspirations of the majority of the People to freedom and self-government. They have also continuously defied world public opinion and rudely rejected the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)].183.	It is no longer a secret that Portuguese colonialism has been able to sustain itself in the heart of Africa because of the economic and military support it receives from its Western allies and from the racist regime of South Africa. The South African regime follows a policy of discrimination and ruthless suppression on the basis of the color and the racial origin of the people. Consequently  the majority of the people have been denied their basic rights and are subjected to constant humiliation and harassment. In open defiance of United Nations resolutions  the Government of South Africa has not only intensified its repressive measures based on the hated policy of apartheid  but it has also extended the racist policy to the adjoining United Nations Territory of Namibia. The arms embargo imposed by the Security Council against South Africa has not been effective. We urge the major trading partners of South Africa to give up the profit motive  to honor Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and to terminate their economic collaboration with a regime whichhas no respect for the fundamental values of human life. In the meantime  it is our sacred duty to extend active assistance to help the oppressed people of South Africa combat racism and racial discrimination.184.	While discussing the problems in southern Africa  we cannot overlook the dangerous situation that has now i developed in Southern Rhodesia. The present racist regime  I after taking over the administration unilaterally and illegally  has launched a policy of discrimination and oppression of the majority. The fate of the people of Zimbabwe is no better than that of their brethren in South Africa and in the Portuguese colonial territories. Even the mandatory sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the illegal regime have often been circumvented by some Western countries. The United Kingdom  as an administering Power  has abdicated its responsibilities towards the people of Zimbabwe by refusing to use effective means to bring down the illegal regime of Ian Smith. Unless sanctions are effectively implemented and power is transferred to the majority as soon as possible  Southern Rhodesia is likely to remain a constant threat to peace. The situation also challenges the effectiveness of the United Nations as a peace-keeper since the mandatory measures taken by the Security Council have failed to restore the minimum rights of the majority.185.	Our delegation attaches great importance to the conference on the law of the sea proposed for next year. Questions concerning the continental shelf  territorial waters and deep-sea fishing have been a constant source of friction among many countries of the world. Those problems  which have preoccupied the minds of men for a considerable time  should be solved. Moreover  it is only fair that all the countries of the world coastal as well as land-locked should share the immense wealth that lies in the sea-bed and subsoil thereof as it is the common heritage of all mankind.186.	Closely associated with the problem of the law of the sea is the right of the land-locked countries to access to the sea. My delegation strongly pleads for the consideration by the proposed conference of the right of land-locked countries to guaranteed free passage to and from the sea.187.	In consonance with the Lusaka Declaration  General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  reading the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  is a necessary step toward the strengthening of conditions of peace and freedom in the zone. The Indian Ocean  which has traditionally been a zone of peace  has for some time past been the scene of a great naval build-up  which does not contribute to the creation of peace in the zone. My delegation fully supports the General Assembly resolution of last year  and hopes that all countries will adhere to it and act in deference to its guiding spirit.188.	These are some of the vital political areas which could threaten world peace and security. These are all sore and sensitive spots. However  it is now being increasingly realized that the major threat to peace comes from the deteriorating economic situation of the world. The ever- widening gap between the rich and the poor nations is in the long run bound to lead to confrontation between the developing and the developed countries. Speaking of the existing disparity between the rich and the poor countries  a former President of this Assembly  Mr. Lester Pearson  recently warned  ""We may have 10 years left in which to being correcting this imbalance. This is  if we are to act in time.""189.	The least developed among the developing countries are more than others confronted by the increasing gulf between them and the relatively developed countries. My delegation would therefore like to stress that a concrete solution should be devised which would ameliorate the difficult situation of such nations by bridging the gap not only between the rich and the poor nations but also between developing nations at various stages of economic and social development. A decade would be too short a time to enable the least-developed nations to acquire the capacity to catch up with the prevalent pace of economic development of the relatively developed countries unless special measures were adopted to help them.190.	To highlight the development problem and to accelerate the development process  the General Assembly has adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. The Strategy sets forth in considerable detail the targets for economic and social progress for the present decade. It emphasizes the need for a co-ordinated international effort to come to grips with malnutrition  unemployment and ignorance in poorer countries and with the growing economic gaps which have brought about an increase in tensions. But despite the adoption of the Strategy  the less developed countries in general continue to face difficulties in the way of their planned economic development because of the prospect of an over-all decrease in external assistance. The target of a net flow of 1 per cent set by the United Nations is not being fulfilled by many rich countries. The present flow of aid to developing countries from all bilateral and multilateral sources amounts to less than $7 000 million a year as compared to $200 000 million a year spent on armaments. In their efforts to eliminate poverty  disease and ignorance  the less developed countries would at the initial phase need the transfer of technology and capital from the advanced countries on a large scale. Otherwise  as we have seen in the past  the process of development will continue to be very  very slow.191.	We in Nepal have launched a national strategy for economic development in the 1970s. We have of course  in co-ordination with the Second Development Decade  fixed our priorities according to national needs and resources. We need co-operation from outside in some priority sectors. The nation as a whole  under the dynamic leadership of His Majesty the King  is confident of success in bringing about a rapid transformation in the socio-economic life of our people.192.	Technical and economic aid is vital  but the importance of international trade cannot be under-estimated. It is the source that could provide a sustained economic growth to any country. We attach great importance to the promotion of our international trade. No nation could have favorable terms of trade unless it has access to different markets and a choice of products to export. Therefore the diversification of trade in terms of market as well as of products has been the major concern of His Majesty's Government in recent years.193.	We participated in all three sessions of UNCTAD and have explained our position and the difficulties we are facing in promoting our international trade. While favorable terms of trade are very essential for all the developing countries  transit facilities are a prerequisite for diversifying the international trade of the land-locked countries. It is gratifying that the third session of UNCTAD has recognized that fact. The Convention on Transit Trade o! ;_and-locked States  has yet to be signed by some coastal countries. We hope the importance of this Convention to land-locked countries will be realized by all and that those countries which have not acceded to it will be able to do so as early as possible.194.	The recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  was a useful first step towards realizing the need for planned action and concerted efforts to protect nature and the environment. The world can no longer remain indifferent to the multifarious problems created by pollution. There is a limit beyond which the natural environment of our earth cannot withstand the tremendous pressure to which it is subjected.195.	While environmental problems have been created as a result of excessive industrialization and urbanization in developed countries  they have been caused by the indiscriminate use of natural resources in the developing countries. The protection of the human environment is  therefore  a problem faced by both developed and developing countries  though in different aspects and patterns. My delegation feels that this problem should be tackled in a planned and systematic way through regular machinery such as an intergovernmental committee on the human environment.196.	Our past efforts to achieve conditions of peace and security through the United Nations have often been frustrated. Consequently there is a tendency to downgrade the United Nations  as has rightly been pointed out by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al8701/Add.l  p. 2]. Earlier I mentioned some of the critical problems to which the United Nations has been unable to provide effective solutions. But still  as His Majesty  our late King Mahendra  observed while addressing this august body at the twenty- second session: ""So far as we are concerned  the only real alternative to the United Nations is an even more powerful United Nations"" [1595th meeting  para. 16]. The very basis of the existence of an Organization such as this is the vital need for it. That is as true today as it was 27 years ago. With all its weaknesses  this Organization is the only hope of mankind for the creation of conditions in which all countries will be able to work for economic and social progress without the threat of war."
"88",5328,"NZL",27,1972,"Mr. President  New Zealand joins with the previous speakers in offering you its warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency. You have already brought efficiency and vigor to the conduct of our work. Like other speakers  I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to my personal friend  Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  who presided so admirably over last year's arduous session.174.	We meet this year oppressed by the tragic events of recent weeks. A new and horrible form of savagery has been visited upon a desperately vulnerable and unprepared world. Yet this year more than most has been marked by the promise of a new era of international peace and stability. For most of its life the United Nations has mirrored the mutual suspicions and hostilities that characterized the attitude of the super-Powers over that period. Now the easing of tension in the relationships among the great Powers is reflected in a growing pattern of reconciliation among the smaller Powers. The courageous initiative of President Nixon  the summit talks in Peking  Moscow  Warsaw and elsewhere and other vigorous moves towards detente  particularly by the two super-Powers  are in the best spirit of the Charter. As both a courtesy and a duty we should pay a tribute to all the Powers concerned for the prospect of a new peace which seems to lie ahead of us.175.	Another development in international relationships that is welcome to New Zealand  as a country having a special interest in the European Economic Community  is the impending enlargement of that Community through the entry of the United Kingdom and other new members. We look forward to the emergence of a stronger  more outward-looking and united Western Europe. The trend towards reconciliation between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe is gathering momentum. The negotiation of non-aggression treaties between West Germany and Poland and between West Germany and the Soviet Union and the four-Power agreement on Berlin were welcome first steps in that direction. We strongly hope that the current negotiations between the two Germanys will end in an agreement that will permit us very soon to welcome both to membership in the United Nations 176.	The changes in great-Power relationships have modified the policies of countries in the area of the world of most direct interest to New Zealand. I refer to Asia and the Pacific. We have been especially encouraged by the Simla meeting between the President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India aimed at settling peacefully the differences between their two countries. The major problems  of course  are not yet solved; but the way has been opened for a durable settlement in the subcontinent under which the three countries of the region will be able to live together in peace. I would emphasize that New Zealand earnestly feels the need for such a settlement.177.	Last year's crisis in East Pakistan caused human suffering on a vast and frightening scale. New Zealand  small though it is  has not hesitated to draw attention to the material and political needs which had to be met in order to end that tragic situation. The new State of Bangladesh has emerged from the chaos and suffering. However  independence alone and of itself cannot put an end to human misery. The reconstruction and development of Bangladesh represents an enormous task which the new Government cannot be expected to accomplish without massive external assistance. A great deal has already been done  both by the United Nations and by individual countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Indian Government  specifically  have successfully tackled a refugee operation larger than any ever before undertaken in the history of the world. The United Nations and non-governmental bodies have undertaken rehabilitation operations on an unprecedented scale and have thus averted more widespread suffering in the new nation. We in New Zealand have tried to help wherever we can to reduce the suffering in Bangladesh and to promote peace and stability among fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations on the subcontinent. However  much more needs to be done. In such a vast undertaking it is essential that all partners have the full support and co-operation of the others. For this practical reason  New Zealand believes it is important that Bangladesh should be admitted to the United Nations as soon as possible.178.	By a happy coincidence  the agreement between India and Pakistan was followed almost immediately by one between two other Asian neighbors  North and South Korea. That agreement opens the way for the deep and bitter hostilities of the past to be worked out by the Koreans themselves. In due course the Organization will no doubt have a role to play. At this juncture  however  we believe that the Assembly took a very wise decision when last week it deferred consideration of the Korean items [2036th meeting]  thereby acknowledging that the two Koreas should have the opportunity  and should be encouraged  to come to terms with each other.179.	The movement in Asia towards reconciliation has not so far been reflected in Indochina and VietNam  in Laos and in the Khmer Republic but it is not for want of effort on the part of South Vietnam and its friends. The United States has offered to withdraw all its forces in return for an internationally supervised cease-fire and the return of the American prisoners. The United States and South Viet-Nam together have offered to hold new elections in which the national liberation front can take its full part in organizing the elections and to have the elections internationally supervised. President Thieu of South Vietnam has offered to resign before the elections take place. My Government supports these proposals  which are directed towards obtaining a just and durable peace settlement in that part of the world.180.	The encouragement that countries have had this year to seek a peaceful resolution of their differences has also been reflected in the Pacific region. New Zealand  Australia and a number of newly independent small nations of the South Pacific have been developing a very real spirit of community and co-operation. More recently the most outstanding evidence of this spirit has been the creation of what is known as the South Pacific Forum. In that Forum the government leaders of Fiji  Tonga  Western Samoa  Nauru  the Cook Islands  Australia and New Zealand have met together to discuss issues of practical interest to our Governments and peoples. As was mentioned by my Australian colleague yesterday  Papua New Guinea has been invited to observe the next meeting. The first Forum  held in Wellington in August last year  has been followed in 1972 by two further meetings  one in Canberra  Australia  and the other in Suva  Fiji. Talks have covered a very wide range of subjects. However  it is a measure of the Forum's concern with immediate practical issues that it has already established a South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. This is a serious effort to stimulate new thinking and create greater opportunities for the development of trade and economic advancement throughout that vast area of the Pacific Ocean  particularly in the south.181.	There is scope for a much greater involvement by the United Nations in the economic progress of the developing countries and the newly independent countries of the South Pacific. Perhaps because of their geographical remoteness  the problems of these countries too have seemed remote to other countries. Yet only a very little more attention  as measured in the total United Nations effort  would do so much more for these small and isolated communities. For that reason we are very pleased that the Asian Development Bank has accepted the independent island nations of the South Pacific as members and that loans are already being made available to them. Also  the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is becoming increasingly involved in the development of the island nations  as are the United Nations Development Program  UNICEF and the specialized agencies concerned. However  I repeat that there is still much more to be done in that area.182.	Over the years  New Zealand has involved the United Nations in the process of decolonization as it applied to New Zealand's island Territories. Some years ago we invited the United Nations missions to observe the act of self- determination in the former Trust Territory of Western Samoa  and also in the Cook Islands. This year the Assembly will have a report from a visiting mission of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which at New Zealand's invitation visited the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Nive [A/8723/Rev. 1  chap. XVI  annex I]. That mission was under the able leadership of Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. In my own Government's view  the report of the Committee is a very well-balanced  fair and  we believe  helpful document. We hope it will do more than enable the Assembly to consider the political issues to which the report itself was directed. It should also lead to a greater understanding of the special problems of survival and development faced by other very small dependent Territories.183.	A minute ago I touched upon the remoteness of the problems of the South Pacific as seen by the rest of the world  and perhaps especially by the European countries. I draw attention now to the serious apprehension which exists in that vast area about the continuance of nuclear testing in the Pacific region.184.	There is a regional concern because this year a further series of nuclear tests was conducted in the Tuamoto archipelago  and that is the fifth such series since 1967. My Government is aware that the problem of nuclear weapons testing is a global one and that nuclear tests are at present being conducted by four different nations. We also realize that nuclear testing is a part of the wider problem of the nuclear arms race. But I want to make it quite clear here today that the continuation of atmospheric nuclear testing in French Polynesia is deeply resented by the people of the whole of the South Pacific region and  indeed  of the North Pacific as well.185.	At its meeting in Fiji earlier this month  the South Pacific Forum that I spoke of earlier unanimously expressed its deep concern that the French Government  in conducting its latest nuclear tests  should have failed to recognize the wishes of the people of the South Pacific area  despite the views so clearly expressed by the Governments and the peoples of those countries. The Forum strongly reaffirmed its opposition to all such nuclear experiments anywhere in the world.186.	In support of that standpoint  the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  referred to again this afternoon  has asked all States intending to carry out nuclear weapons tests to abandon those plans.  Countries in Asia  and in Latin America bordering the Pacific  have declared their total opposition. It is our intention to seek the Assembly's endorsement of these calls to cease all nuclear weapons testing.187.	Nuclear testing is an issue on which the smaller States have had to speak bluntly to some of the larger Powers whose activities affect us.188.	In the debate last year [1955th meeting]  the New Zealand representative spoke of the great Powers taking policy decisions that profoundly affect the economic stability of smaller nations. There is still a pressing need for the great Powers to recognize that smaller economies can rock dangerously in the waves of their major-policy decisions. There is still a pressing need for a further liberalization of world trade and monetary matters. New Zealand attaches considerable importance to a successful outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations under the framework of GATT in 1973. The Kennedy Round failed to meet our hopes.189.	New Zealand  like so many other  smaller countries  is heavily dependent on trade in primary agricultural commodities. We are vitally concerned  on that account  with the progress that will have to be made with eliminating or reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products. The developing countries quite rightly want to have their say in these talks  in these negotiations  in these kinds of decisions. Like us  they are less interested in tariff reductions on industrial products  which seem to be the pervading preoccupation of such talks  than in primary products. There are few benefits for smaller and developing nations in enhancing the economic advantages of the great industrial Powers. But I urge the need for less international charity and more true international economic reality.190.	I suggested that the past year has seen the advent of a more favorable general political climate. Unfortunately  it will also be remembered as a year in which the resort to terrorism  individual killing of totally innocent and unsuspecting people  mass cruelty  mistreatment  and even genocide  have left a very tragic mark. Private violence as a means of influencing issues between States must be condemned as strongly as State violence against States  which of course is proscribed by our Charter.191.	The revulsion to which violence gives rise  in the minds of all people throughout the world  renders these horrible actions politically sterile and useless  indeed counterproductive. It does not further the cause which they variously profess to espouse. Take two outstanding examples: those who claim to speak for the Palestinian and the Croatian peoples. What this violence does do is to increase the readiness of Governments to concert their actions to halt this scourge throughout the world.192.	The New Zealand Government approves the efforts made by the Secretary-General to seek a greater awakening of the United Nations interest in these horrible actions and events.193.	In the field of human rights  the right to life and security of person must have first place in anyone's scale of priorities. Nobody will underestimate the difficulties of grappling with the subject of international terrorism. Yet  it is surely right that this subject should be on our agenda. It will be a sad reflection on our strength of purpose and on the capacity of this Organization if no effective means can be found to eliminate the threat to innocent lives which this modern phenomenon presents.194.	At the same time  we must not overlook other problems of human rights which may gravely affect very large numbers of people in particular areas of the world. The question of people of Asian origin expelled from Uganda is a case in point  as was already mentioned. My Government understands the wish of the Government of Uganda  or of any other Government  to ensure that the control of its economy remains largely in the hands of its own nationals. But there is more than one way of implementing such policy  and many countries have shown the way.195.	The decision taken by the Uganda Government involves the abrupt wrenching from their own homes and the expulsion from the country of people who  for the most part  have that country as their only home and who spring from generations of people who haVe lived in that country. The New Zealand Government  which has offered a place in our own multiracial society to some of those expelled from Uganda  hopes that the Government of Uganda will even now reconsider the decision that it has taken. We would expect that  at the least  a more reasonable time limit for departure will be set and that  having regard to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the persons concerned will be allowed to transfer from the country those assets to which they have an undoubted personal right. And so we strongly support the initiative taken by Sir Alec Douglas-Home  Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom. My delegation  as you can see  is in favor of his request for the inclusion in the agenda of a new item entitled ""International implications of the expulsion of the Asian community from Uganda"" [A/8794].196.	Before I leave the subject of human rights I should like  only very briefly  to refer to three measures taken by the New Zealand Government which may be of interest to some countries represented in this Assembly. First  New Zealand has enacted its own Race Relations Act and should this year ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)  annex]. Secondly  our Government is this year passing legislation providing for the introduction of equal pay for women. New Zealand.was the first country in the world to give women the vote and so we are rather proud to be among the pioneers in making this further contribution to women's rights. The third measure I have in mind is a bill recently introduced in our Parliament which we hope will be passed this year and which will introduce a system whereby accident compensation amounting to 80 per cent of salary will be available to all employed persons who may suffer injury in any circumstances whatever  including accidents such as road accidents or any other kind of accident which is not related in any way to work at their jobs. We regard this as a major social advance and will be happy to provide details to any other countries which may be interested in it.197.	A notable achievement in international co-operation of the best sort has been demonstrated in Stockholm where the Conference on the Human Environment alerted the world community to the dangers created in our environment by mankind's sometimes reckless use of the earth's resources. The fact of the Conference and its achievement is surely evidence of the vitality of this United Nations. I should like to place on record my Government's appreciation for the efforts made by Sweden as host Government to bring about the success of the Conference. We hope that the role played by Mr. Maurice Strong as Secretary-General of that Conference will be further recognized as we consider  I hope at this session  the setting up of new institutions  including a governing council for environmental programs and an environment fund. In anticipation of the Assembly's decision on the Fund  my Government will be prepared to contribute over a five-year period the sum of $320 000.198.	The future crisis of world population  which will double by the year 2000  is inextricably linked with the problem of the world environment. Great tensions already exist in some parts of the world between populations and the space  natural resources and social structures available to them considerable stress. If these problems are not better understood now and dealt with in a pragmatic and  I hope  understanding way  we will be giving our children a legacy for which they will not thank us and in which we will take very little pride. Our Government is anxious to take its full share in international efforts which must move forward  we believe  speedily. We welcome the decision to hold the World Population Conference in 1974 [resolution 2683 (XXV)]. New Zealand will also continue  as we have in the past  to support the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which  after only two years  is already an active and worth-while agent of this Organization for this global endeavor.199.	New Zealand has always ""been a staunch supporter of the United Nations. New Zealand has always constantly supported the concept of an active role for the Secretary- General  and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Waldheim. We commend his firm approach to financial and administrative problems and questions at a difficult time. We commend him for the forthright action he has taken to draw the Assembly's attention to the growing question of violence and terrorism. In many more ways also the Secretary-General this year has exercised energetically the powers of initiative with which his office is properly endowed. We trust that he will continue to do so and he is certainly assured of the support and co-operation of New Zealand in that role. 200.	Again  Mr. President  I congratulate you in your high office. I wish you every success in your heavy and demanding task."
"89",5373,"OMN",27,1972,"Allow me first of all to congratulate you  Sir  upon your assumption of the duties of President of the General Assembly and to assure you of the co-operation of my Government and delegation. We are confident that you will fulfill your difficult duties with the same distinction that you have devoted to other duties in the service of your country.116.	Allow me also  Mr. President  to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor  the distinguished Foreign Minister of Indonesia Mr. Adam Malik. We in Oman will always remember that it was under his presidency that Oman became a Member of the United Nations.117.	Looking back over the events of the past year  we may find much to be encouraged about in our quest for peace and international harmony  although we must at the same time point out the problems that we face and on which no progress has yet been achieved.118.	On the positive side we must point to the detente and rapprochement that has been achieved by the major Powers. The arms limitation agreements already achieved at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and in Moscow go part of the way to achieving the objective of placing a real limitation on arms of mass destruction. As a representative of an under-developed country  we find that the progress that has been achieved in this field has been encouraging  and we can only hope for further progress  for it is indeed deplorable that 7.2 per cent of the world's gross national product is being spent on armaments and highly sophisticated methods of mass destruction. We feel that these resources could be better spent on aid to the underdeveloped countries of the world  for it is only this course of action that can assure peace  security and harmony among the nations and the peoples of this planet.119.	My Government is also highly gratified to hear of the detente and rapprochement that has been occurring between other nations that have so very recently been involved in futile and fruitless confrontations. It is our deep hope that these nations will not stop at just ceasing their previous confrontations but will continue to achieve lasting peace  brotherhood and co-operation in all fields with their erstwhile adversaries.120.	We particularly welcome the agreement that has been achieved between the Governments of India and Pakistan. These two countries are very close to us not only geographically and economically but also historically. It is our sincere hope that these great and peace-loving countries will progress from partial agreements to full accord on a permanent and just peace and or mutual co-operation in all fields. It is also our sincere hope that any such peace will not reflect the weight of military conquest or victory  for it is in this area more than anywhere else that true statesmanship requires foresight and magnanimity.121.	We also welcome the agreements that have been achieved between the divided countries of this world  namely  West and East Germany and North and South Korea. Their decision to solve their problems by peaceful means requires our highest support  for their decisions comply with the spirit of our Charter. It is our sincere hope that these States will persevere in the path that they have chosen and that they will soon join us as full Members of this Organization.122.	The further consolidation and widening of the European Economic Community that has occurred during the course of this past year is also welcome to us. It is our profound hope that the new Europe will be a force for peace among nations and that it will continue to expand its generous aid to under-developed countries.123.	I now turn to an area of the world that is of great interest to us. I refer to the Gulf area. My Government's policy in this highly important and strategic area is based upon our profound desire that there should be in this area the basic and fundamental stability in which the nations of the area can work for progress and development in the economic  social and political spheres.124.	Under the reign of my enlightened Sovereign  His Majesty Sultan Qabus  we in Oman have been able to safeguard just such a stability and remarkable strides towards progress have already been achieved by my country and people. Schools and health clinics have been set up  and Oman has already begun a network of roads to connect its various parts.125.	Ports and telecommunications facilities are now almost completed and many  many projects are now under construction.126.	We realize that we have only just begun the task of laying the basic infrastructure for further economic and social development and we realize that the road ahead will be both long and arduous. But we  the Government and people of Oman  have freely resolved to embark and to persevere on the course of action we have freely chosen. My Government and people will also welcome all economic and technical assistance and investment by foreign States and commercial enterprises  as long as they are in the interest of our economic development as a free and sovereign country. My Government particularly welcomes economic and technical assistance from international organizations  especially the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies  which have such a wealth of experience and know-how.127.	In this context my Government and people will not allow various foreign elements to disrupt the framework of peace  stability and progress that we have freely chosen. These elements seek to divert us and our limited resources from this noble and enlightened path and they hope thereby to retard our economic and social development. We will resist these foreign elements which seek to interfere in our internal affairs and which have openly and shamelessly declared their aggressive and seditious intentions. They harbor nothing but enmity toward our country and people and never cease to slander us. We in Oman will not interfere in the internal affairs of another State. By the same token  we will not stand idly by while another State or various alien elements interfere in our internal affairs. 128.	My Government's policy with regard to the situation in South Africa is based upon our complete support of the principle of self-determination of African peoples and of our total rejection of the policies of apartheid and racism practiced by the regime in South Africa. We support the rights of the African people struggling for freedom and independence.129.	I would now like to turn to the situation in the Middle East. The tragic events and continuing crisis in the Middle East impose a special responsibility upon this Organization and it is our profound hope that this year the Members of this body and the members of the Security Council will be able to resolve and enforce a just and permanent peace  for the present crisis in the Middle East poses the greatest threat to world peace and international security and  if you will allow me to add  to the efficacy and credibility of this noble Organization.130.	We believe that no solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that does not deal with the heart of the situation and its basic causes. The forcible expulsion of the Palestinian nation from their land  and the land of their ancestors  and the creation of an alien racist State that prides itself on its religious exclusivity constitute one of the most tragic and immoral crimes of this century. It was a crime and a blunder that the United Nations has a special responsibility to correct. No solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the relegation of the Palestinian people to the status of refugees  living on international charity and deprived of their most basic human rights and of their national sovereignty.131.	Israel is the source of terrorism in the Middle East area. How else can we interpret the daily acts of aggression against Lebanon  Syria and Jordan? How else can we interpret the murder of innocent women  children  and the aged and the use of poison gas and napalm by the Israelis? Is this not terrorism?132.	We believe that no solution to the Middle East crisis can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the acquisition and annexation of territory by the use or threat of force  or as the Zionists euphemistically call it  ""creating facts"". Our belief is based not only upon elementary morality but also upon the principles of our Charter and of the most basic tenets of international law.133.	We believe that no solution can be just or permanent that condones and perpetuates the annexation of Arab Jerusalem by a Zionist aggressor. To allow the annexation of the city of peace  the holy city of three major religions  by the Zionists would be an act of eternal desecration of that great city.134.	In this connexion I would now like to appeal to the major Powers of this world to work in the United Nations and outside it for a permanent peace in the Middle East based upon justice. These Powers have often in the past pursued a policy in the area based upon their own strategic and economic interests or upon the wishes of vested interests consisting of vocal and often violent minorities in their own countries. What is required in the Middle East today is a policy in the wider interests of a permanent and just peace in compliance with the letter and the spirit of our Charter and of international law.135.	It has been an honor and a privilege to have had this opportunity on behalf of Oman to address the General Assembly of the United Nations  which meets now at a delicate and complex time. The nations of the world hope that we will be able to establish a fundamental framework for peace and international harmony. I thank you  Mr. President  for giving me this opportunity to address the General Assembly."
"90",5419,"PAK",27,1972,"Mr. President  I should like to join those who have preceded me on this podium and to express to you the satisfaction of my delegation on your election to the presidency of this historic session of the General Assembly. Your personal wisdom and experience  as well as the noble traditions of your country  Poland  assure us that the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly will proceed with the least delay and have a fruitful outcome. The Pakistan delegation assures you of its full and active co-operation in the fulfillment of your responsibilities.133.	I should also like to take this opportunity to convey  on behalf of my delegation and my Government  our admiration for the exemplary and able manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  guided the eventful proceedings of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.134.	My delegation whole-heartedly shares the sentiments of satisfaction expressed by so many delegations that in Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim we have an able and worthy successor to UThant. Our Secretary-General's efforts to seek solutions to seemingly intractable problems have been relentless; his energy is unbounded; and his manner is forthright and conscientious. His qualities augur well for the fulfillment of the aspiration of the majority of Member States that the United Nations should play a more active role in securing justice and peace in our world.135.	The last session of the General Assembly closed with the clash of arms still resounding in these halls. No less than the conflict itself  its consequences pose a challenge to the United Nations. Though recent developments have set a trend towards detente and negotiation in international relations  it can hardly be said that this process has assumed global proportions or that the process  though reducing tension in one arena of the world  has not transferred it to another. Nevertheless  no one  whatever his political and ideological affiliations  can belittle the beneficent prospects for world peace opened by the summit meetings between the United States and China and between the United States and the Soviet Union  thanks to the statesmanship  sense of history and initiatives of President Nixon. My delegation would also like to express its profound satisfaction that the recent visit of Prime Minister Tanaka has resulted in the termination of the era of conflict between Japan and China and the resumption of the traditional friendship and co-operation between those two great Asian nations. This accord will provide a new impetus for peace in Asia  the Far East and in the world.136.	Elsewhere as well  former disputants have found it possible to initiate a discussion of their differences. The delegation of Pakistan expresses the sincere hope that the negotiations between East and West Germany and between North  and South Korea will lead to a normalization of their relations on the basis of equity and the aspirations of their peoples.137.	There is no reason why such negotiations and dialogs cannot result in a just settlement of the war in Viet-Nam. A whole generation in IndoChina has endured the agony of continuing war. It has long been clear that the situation is not susceptible of a military solution. The principle must be recognized that this conflict  as others  can be resolved only in accordance with the right of self-determination of the peoples of IndoChina  who must be assured of the realization of the goals and objectives of the Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in IndoChina.  It is entirely just that the heroic and invincible people of Viet-Nam  who have made such unparalleled sacrifices for national liberation  should insist on the assurance that what they have suffered and endured for over a generation has not been in vain.138.	The present climate of discussion and accommodation should be seized upon to promote a process of reconciliation among all Powers. It would be tragic if the current trends are not brought to bear on the resolution of outstanding disputes  for the persistence of a dispute over a period of time renders its solution the more difficult. The history of India-Pakistan relations is an example of this phenomenon.139.	The new Government of Pakistan has approached all the complex historical and political issues underlying and arising from the recent conflict on the subcontinent with political realism. We are anxious that prejudices and preconceptions of the past  and the memory of suffering  should not form an obstacle to peace. The President of Pakistan has demonstrated his resolve to bring about a change from the path of confrontation to that of conciliation. The Simla Agreement of 3 July last  between India and Pakistan  accepts the principle of non-use of force and of settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It provides for the withdrawal of forces from each other's territories and envisages a step-by-step approach for the settlement of the remaining problems.140.	It is our determination and hope that that Agreement will open a new chapter in our relations with India  leading to the resolution of all our outstanding problems. It is important in this context that the troop withdrawals should take place forthwith. These were to have been completed within 30 days of the ratification of the Agreement and have already been twice delayed. The view that these withdrawals are in any manner conditional on the prior delineation of the line of control in Kashmir is not warranted by the letter and spirit of the Simla Agreement.141.	The Simla Agreement also looks forward to a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Pending that settlement the two countries are to respect the line of control resulting from the cease-fire of 17 December 1971  without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. Our position in this regard is well known. It has remained unchanged ever since the resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan were adopted 24 years ago and India and Pakistan agreed that the future of Jammu and Kashmir should be decided by the people of the state through a plebiscite. The right of self-determination is saAosanct. It is inalienable. The future of Kashmir can be decided only by the people of Kashmir. The will of the people of Kashmir is the objective reality.142.	We believe that the basis of our future relations with our former eastern province  which is now called ""Bangladesh""  should also be established through dialog and discussion in accordance with the wishes of our people. We bear our brothers there no ill will. This has been demonstrated by the unconditional release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The President of Pakistan  Mr. Bhutto  has taken other initiatives to facilitate the resolution of the host of problems that have arisen in the wake of the tragic events .of 1971. We find it difficult to understand the precondition which is now imposed that Pakistan must recognize ""Bangladesh"" before the resolution of our problems can be initiated.143.	The recognition of ""Bangladesh"" is different for Pakistan than for other States  It bears upon an important principle. We cannot ignore the fact that the territory which now proclaims itself as ""Bangladesh"" was an integral part of Pakistan  and that it was sundered from Pakistan by the use of armed force. The events of last year have already eroded the principle of the territorial integrity of States  enshrined in the Charter. There is no doubt a new reality in the subcontinent. But if this precedent is not to imperil the security and integrity of all multinational or multilingual States  it is important that its legitimacy be consecrated  not through Pakistan's coerced recognition of its existence  but through a freely negotiated and just settlement of the issues which interpose serious obstacles to the recognition of ""Bangladesh"" and its admission to the United Nations.144.	It is unreasonable to expect Pakistan to support the admission of ""Bangladesh"" to the United Nations while the two resolutions of the United Nations remain unimplemented. Both General Assembly resolution 2793 (XXVI) and Security Council resolution 307 (1971) called upon the parties to preserve human life.145.	In its resolution 307(1971) of 21 December 1971  the Security Council called upon ""all those concerned"" to observe in full the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1949 relating to the wounded and sick  prisoners of war and the civilian population. Resolution 307 (1971) is of a mandatory nature  having been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter  and applies not only to India and Pakistan  but also to the Dacca authorities  who had assumed the powers of government and administration by that time. The third Geneva Convention of 1949  relating to prisoners of war   enjoins the detaining Power under article 118  to release and repatriate all prisoners of war immediately on the cessation of active hostilities. The text of the Convention  as wall as the authoritative commentaries on it  leave no room for doubt or ambiguity on this point. The obligation is unequivocal  unilateral and unconditional. This position has been most recently reiterated by the Conference of Governmental Experts on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts  which met in Geneva earlier this year under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC].146.	Yet  almost 10 months after the cessation of hostilities  over 90 000 Pakistani prisoners of war and civilian detainees  including women and children  continue to be held captive in Indian camps. The ICRC  as well as the International Commission of Jurists  has expressed concern over the continuing delay in the release of the prisoners of war.147.	The treatment of our personnel in captivity is also cause for serious concern. Apart from complaints about insult  provocation and harassment  force has been used against the prisoners on several occasions. A few months back more than a dozen Pakistani soldiers were shot and killed at the Ranchi camp. Last week another 8 were killed and 25 wounded. It is obvious that this latest incident  like the previous one  has occurred because India continues to hold our prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Conventions.148.	The position that the released and repatriation of our prisoners of war requires the agreement of ""Bangladesh"" is not supported by the Geneva Conventions. On the other hand  the Dacca authorities refuse even to discuss this question until we recognize ""Bangladesh"". In this manner our prisoners of war are sought to be used as pawns for securing political concessions from Pakistan  in violation of all legal and moral principles. The Dacca authorities have unnecessarily assumed the responsibility for obstructing the repatriation of our prisoners of war because we are quite prepared to reach an honorable settlement with them.149.	By obstructing the repatriation of our prisoners of war as well as by failing to take all measures to preserve human life  ""Bangladesh"" continues to violate its international obligations  including those flowing from Security Council resolution 307 (1971). That resolution creates  by virtue of Article 25 and Article 2  paragraph 6  of the Charter  mandatory obligations for all concerned  including ""Bangladesh"". It follows  therefore  that fulfillment of the obligation under that resolution is a test of the ability and willingness of the applicant State to carry out its obligations under the Charter  which is one of the qualifications prescribed in Article 4 of the Charter for entry of new members to the United Nations.150.	I should like to express  from this rostrum  our gratification at the just and principled position of the People's Republic of China in defense of the decisions of this Organization and the interest of peace and justice in the South Asian subcontinent. The Security Council was unable to make a favorable recommendation on the application of ""Bangladesh"" because certain States seemed more anxious to force China to use its veto than to facilitate the entry of ""Bangladesh"" into our Organization. One cannot but suspect that the precipitate and imprudent attempt to agitate the matter here in the General Assembly is not devoid of similar motives. Unless the Assembly addresses itself to the unresolved problems organically inseparable from admission  its consideration of this question cannot advance the possibility of the admission of ""Bangladesh"" to the United Nations. My delegation calls upon all Member States  irrespective of the status of their bilateral relations with ""Bangladesh""  to facilitate  during this debate  the fulfillment of the objective that must remain uppermost  namely  the establishment of a just and durable peace in the subcontinent.151.	We believe that the effectiveness and  indeed  the future of the United Nations will depend upon its ability to promote not merely peace  but justice and a just peace. It is on the distinction between justice and injustice that we must base our efforts to improve the United Nations machinery for maintaining international peace and security. That this distinction is of fundamental importance is inherent in the Charter. For example  the Charter recognizes the legitimacy of wars of self-defense while outlawing wars of aggression and expansion. This distinction  between justice and injustice  which  unfortunately  is too often overlooked  is contained in Article 2 paragraph 3 of the Charter  which enjoins all Member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner ""that international peace and security  and justice  are not endangered"".152.	The delegation of Pakistan favors a serious and constructive review of the Charter in order to explore avenues through which to establish a more effective system of international security. Such a system must obviously not ignore the disparity of power between States. On the other hand  the permanent members of the Security Council should be prepared to render more than lip service to the purposes and principles of the Organization and to demonstrate their determination to insist on the implementation of its mandatory resolutions. That at least one permanent member takes its obligation in this respect seriously is a source of encouragement and hope.153.	There is a need for such determination in seeking a just solution to the problems of southern Africa. In that region  Portugal continues its oppressive rule over its colonial territories; the illegal racist regime of Ian Smith is firmly entrenched in Southern Rhodesia; in Namibia  despite the energetic efforts of the Secretary-General  there is no sign of progress towards the goal of independence. The policy of apartheid is not only becoming daily more oppressive in South Africa  it is progressively being extended in various forms to Namibia  Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonial territories. This situation exists because some of the major Powers derive profit in its maintenance and for that reason they prevent any initiative for decisive action by the Security Council. They seem oblivious to the fact that unless the injustice and inhumanity in southern Africa are eliminated  the whole area may soon erupt in a bloody race conflict.154.	Injustice remain to be redressed in the Middle East as well. The Security Council has been unable to secure the implementation of its resolution 242 (1967)  much less to devise a solution to the underlying causes of the conflict. The victor of the six-day war continues to be in forcible occupation of conquered Arab lands  including Jerusalem  and  despite the odium of the international community  persists in violating at will the territories of its neighbors. Yet  Israel demands the annexation of the occupied Arab territories in order to maintain ""secure frontiers"". Both the impunity with which it is able to carry out its aggressive incursions against its Arab neighbors  as well as the revelations of recent months  indicate that it is not Israel  but the Arab countries bordering it  whose security and territorial integrity is in serious jeopardy. Those Member States which have the greatest power and influence in the area and which have failed to deploy them fully in the interests of a just settlement based on the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war  owe a great responsibility to the international community and to history for their default.155.	A final solution of the problem of the Middle East will have to be based on justice. The 1967 conflict was but the effect of a cause: the ruthless and unjust displacement of the people of Palestine. Those who seek to maintain the status quo in the Middle East  as well as those who acquiesce in its maintenance  would be well advised to' remember that no structure of peace will endure if it ignores the hunger for justice which drives the Arab people  and in particular the people of Palestine.156.	An inescapable part of our endeavor to establish a durable system of international security is the effort to control and ultimately eliminate the destructive potential of nuclear and conventional armaments. Pakistan attaches the highest priority to both bilateral and multilateral efforts for disarmament. We have participated actively in the negotiations in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and acknowledge the earnest efforts of its members to bring about agreement on the elimination of chemical weapons. We hope that by next year the members would be able to present the world with such an achievement.157.	However  it cannot be denied that hitherto the concrete results of both the bilateral and multilateral negotiations have been meager. The issues with which we have been mainly concerned are not measures for disarmament  but for non-armament. Their most tangible outcome has been the establishment of an uneasy equilibrium between the two super-Powers.158.	It is time that a beginning was made towards genuine disarmament. My delegation supports in principle the convening of a world disarmament conference at the appropriate time. The conference must so devise its agenda as to secure the participation of all nuclear Powers in its deliberations. To make such participation possible  we need to do more than to establish another forum or to make changes in the existing machinery of negotiations. It is only by concrete and substantial reductions of nuclear and sophisticated weapons that Powers with overwhelming nuclear and other capability will be able to establish their credibility in disarmament negotiations. An important step towards building mutual confidence would be an undertaking not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.159.	This is not to say that the first strategic arms limitation agreement is not of high significance or that it is not a step which breaks new ground. It is both. At the same time  we cannot but share the anxiety voiced by so many delegations that while quantitative limits have been placed on the build-up of weapons of mass destruction  the nuclear arms race remains unchecked  in fact intensified  in the field of their qualitative development.160.	The self-defeating nature of this approach and the absence of any possibility of reducing the disparities among the nuclear Powers cannot but exercise a negative influence on any efforts to make the disarmament negotiations all-inclusive. The disparities must first be reduced before universal participation will come to be regarded as compatible with the supreme national interest and security of those nuclear Powers which find the offers to include them uninviting.161.	There is an urgent need to rectify the current inequity in the distribution of the world's wealth among and within nations. The evolution in our understanding of the issues of poverty and development has indicated that traditional strategies of growth which largely ignore the imperative of distributive justice will not suffice to eradicate inequality  mass poverty and unemployment in the developing countries. The Government of Pakistan has initiated comprehensive economic and social reforms in order to create a framework in which our concern for greater production is complementary to the need for a better distribution of its benefits; and the generation of economic growth and employment is being treated as a primary instead of a secondary objective. These reforms cover a fairly wide spectrum  including land reforms  reforms in the banking and corporate structure  a nationwide integrated rural works and housing program  and fundamental changes in our system of education and health.162.	The success of strategies designed to secure social justice and generate greater employment in the poor nations can be facilitated by the active co-operation and contribution of the affluent world. Such co-operation is in the common interest of all countries. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  the third session of the United . Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in Santiago in April and May  and the efforts being exerted to reform the international monetary system  have all underlined the global interdependencies of the issues of ecology  trade  aid and development. They have indicated the importance of rectifying all imbalances affecting man  whether they result from an excessive and reckless consumption of the world's resources or from inadequate consumption  poverty and hunger.163.	At Stockholm  where the most immediate concerns were those of the developed countries  the poor nations exhibited an acute awareness of the unity and interdependence of the world. At Santiago  however  on issues of equal if not greater importance for the developing countries  the same sympathy and understanding was not apparent in the attitudes of the developed countries. There can be no double standards in this world. If the developing countries are being called upon to assume responsibilities for preserving the delicate balance of ecology  they cannot at the same time be denied their rightful share of the world's wealth.164.	For 25 years in this Organization Pakistan's expressions and actions have been inspired by the desire to secure peace and justice in international relations. On innumerable occasions we have incurred the wrath of mighty Powers for cur forthright stand in support of the principles and purposes of the Charter. But in placing its trust in this Organization Pakistan always hoped that its collective strength and moral influence would in time of peril be steadfastly exerted against any threat to our security  sovereignty and territorial integrity.. The United Nations  however  proved helpless in the face of the armed aggression against our country. Yet we continue to hope that a sense of justice will induce the membership of the United Nations at least to contribute constructively to the elimination of the consequences of the use of force against a fellow Member State.165.	As for our brothers who are today separated from us in what is now called ""Bangladesh""  we wish them nothing but peace and prosperity and expect of them a similar understanding and sympathy  which we are sure will prevail  in the resolution of our outstanding problems on the basis of justice  equity and the aspirations of our people."
"91",5509,"PER",27,1972,"It is an honor for me to come to this rostrum at the United Nations and to speak in this forum where we meet every year to resume the threads of the great international dialog and to expound the basic positions of countries on the problems affecting relations among States within the framework of this Organization.134.	May I at the outset convey to you  Mr. President  the warmest congratulations of my Government  and my own personal congratulations  on your well-earned election. In choosing you the General Assembly has done nothing other than pay a tribute to your noble country and to the years that you have devoted to the cause of peace and to the Organization itself in the many and delicate responsibilities that your Government has entrusted to you.135.	I can not fail to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik  whom the Peruvian Government had the honor to receive as a guest during the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries in Lima. His ability and tact ensured the harmonious development of the General Assembly's debates at its last session.136.	May I also sincerely congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his designation to his highly sensitive post. The new Secretary-General of the Organization is a personality whom we know well from his earlier diplomatic activities in his country's service  in which he showed outstanding ability and a special vocation for the ideals of peace. This gives us assurance that his leadership of the Secretariat will be guided by the same principles and qualities.137.	The Government of Peru wishes to pay a tribute of profound respect to former Secretary-General UThant  who for 10 years unselfishly gave himself to the tasks of building a world at peace. To achieve such a noble goal  UThant bent his most serious efforts and earned the appreciation of the international community.138.	We are witnessing a qualitative change in contemporary history: the classic economic and social systems and the political and philosophic tenets on which they rested are being revised. A new revolutionary stage in the history of mankind is emerging  whose basic trend is the search for new approaches which will make possible the achievement of peace and security in justice  both domestically kid in international relations.139.	From the very outset of its task of transformation  the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of my country realized that it would be impossible to succeed unless that task was understood as a shattering of internal domination and external dependence  key contributing factors to under-development. A real transformation of the social and economic structures that would alter the relations of political power in our society so as to create a democratic  humanistic and just community was not feasible unless our efforts were directed simultaneously abroad  whence  to a large extent  originated the major events that took place within our country.140.	During the four years it has been in power a period completed just a few days ago  on 3 October the Revolutionary Government has been laying the ideological and political foundations on which it is building the new Peruvian society. These foundations were clearly defined by the President of the Republic  General Juan Velasco Alvarado  when in July of this year he stated:""The revolution aims to create a pluralist economy  based on three fields of activity: a sizable State sector  a private sector of reformed enterprises enjoying all the guarantees of stability and respect which it requires  and a social property sector to whose support the State will give priority-all three aimed at the creation of a social democracy of full participation for all.""141.	The economic pluralism to which I have just referred will permit real and progressive participation by citizens at all levels in the decisions which affect their destiny. Policy  understood in its wide sense as action on the social whole  will be exercised on a community basis in the daily activities of the citizens  who in taking decisions on their enterprises  their institutions or their trade unions will be deciding on and guiding the fabric of their society at their own particular levels.142.	There can be no true revolution without a transformation in man. Structural change means  basically  a change in mentality within the social and economic process. That is why new guide-lines were necessary in the field of education. The new Education Act sets up a new system in this decisive field and will progressively lead to a better and more adequate adaptation of our people to their environment. If we want true culture and not a transplanted culture  we must teach man to know and to recognize himself within the specific confines of the environment in which he is destined to live. His world must be created and organized around the everyday experiences of his own life and from this fruitful interrelation there must emerge a new culture that will place him  and allow him to know how to fit himself into his rightful place  individually and socially. We can be sure that the Peruvian who emerges from this process will achieve a worthy and independent society  humanistic and free  qualitatively different from the one that has existed until now.143.	The transcendental events that spelled the beginning of our revolutionary process and that are known to this Organization were followed by the clear-cut definition of the principles and acts that Peru considers would constitute a foreign policy in keeping with the new reality which is felt in all our sovereign undertakings and which is consistent and consonant with our domestic policy.144.	Development was not possible without breaking the circle of dependency. That is a collective task  one that calls for full awareness of self and faith in our destiny as a community that is emerging in the form of healthy nationalism  which is the most important factor in our social identity and in our integration as a country.145.	Nationalism and independence are therefore the pillars of our foreign policy nationalism as the recognition of ourselves; independence that allows us the freedom of decision necessary to achieve our destiny.146.	Thus the principles of universality in our foreign relations and the respect for ideological plurality are the ground rules that govern our relations with regard to the changing international scene. We have acted consistently and initiated dialogs with all countries of the world  establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China  Albania and New Zealand  as well as extending recognition to Bangladesh.147.	The world of the cold war  built around two hegemonic centers of power from whose unlimited strength it was almost impossible to escape  has now become a multi centered structure of varied balance in which alliances are not total or antagonisms final and in which the search for satisfaction of the interests of the smaller countries is feasible given the wider margin of play. The awakening of the third world is  in this process  one of the most significant events of our times. The full and honest incorporation of Latin America in the process of awakening is an especially enlightening development.148.	In Latin America we recognize the existence of individual and differing ways that do not gainsay the community of interests of the continent  which is embarked on a course towards economic independence. We share similar problems of under-development  culture and our undeniably common origin. In this interaction within the structural unit of which the Latin American peoples consist  there must be recognized variables between agreement and disagreement  and between greater and lesser relationships  as occur in the life of human communities. Yet it would be difficult for us to understand our relations in terms of hegemonies  of positions of predominance that might  in themselves  contradict the traditional fraternal relations that we have maintained even when differences have appeared.149.	The common economic and political experience in foreign affairs has given Latin America a structural character that goes beyond the mere convergence of culture and mentality. It now possesses its own genuine history  formed within its own tangible circumstances  forged in the defense of common interests in the face of external pressures that affected all equally-a history that has been woven around shared interests  but also let us say so frankly around shared frustrations. This concept of Latin American existence has already begun to foreshadow the outline of the whole  which knows itself to be varied and sees itself as different within the international concert. Yet this very concept endows it with an awareness of a self that has emerged individually from among its components as a sort of Latin American nationalism that  ultimately  will carry us to the point where our histories will converge in a form of communitary integration.150.	At present  the relaxation of tension is a process that touches every sector of the globe and  within it  we have constantly claimed a relocation of Latin America within the new context which  precisely because of its flexibility  may well be favorable.151.	It was this conviction that led us to submit our request of April last to the Organization of American States. In that request we contended that change had also made itself felt in America  and that therefore there was no justification for the isolation from the system of one of our sister Republics.152.	To uphold in 1972 the views that in 1964 led to the adoption of measures against the Republic of Cuba is to deny the advance of history  the evolution of ideas  and the qualitative changes that occur in the lives of peoples.153.	In July of this year Peru had the great satisfaction of renewing diplomatic relations with the Republic of Cuba  firmly convinced as it is that fraternity lies not in words but in deeds.154.	From its very inception  the Revolutionary Government of my country has encouraged integration efforts in Latin America  aware that a truly liberating economic process cannot be completed without the integration of vast geo-economic areas which will allow the use of scale economies  which alone can ensure full development and are able to compete on the world market.155.	The Treaty establishing the Latin American Free Trade Association was  therefore  a fundamental contribution to the formation of an integrationist mentality in Latin America  and has permitted the creation of the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement  which has acquired tremendous impetus.156.	The agreements recently arrived at within the frame-work of the Andean Agreement are clear proof of the firm desire for integration that fills and inspires the countries parties to the Agreement. Integration  for us  is basically an undertaking for joint development  in which the creation of the productive machinery is from the outset converted into a common task. The approval of the joint industrial program for the establishment of the machine-tool industry shows the degree of compromise and the dimensions of the problems of development and  also  the will to arrive at a true agreement on integration.157.	Together with all other Latin American countries  Peru is undergoing profound transformations and finds itself aligned with the countries of the third world  with  which we share a common denominator: under-development. For when we clearly understood the realities of our life as an under-developed and dependent society undergoing forms of domestic domination that were an extension of foreign dependency  we also discovered that our condition was shared with the countries of the third world which  in different ways  are tending towards liberation. Thus we find ourselves in a new situation. We are part of the so-called third world which daily  with wealth  generated out of its own poverty  contributes to the opulence and the power of the industrialized societies.158.	We also realized that political independence is not enough to achieve true emancipation; that there persist subtle forms of political  economic  finance and technological domination geared to the maintenance of old forms of domination. Under-development is  to us  therefore  a multidimensional phenomenon. It emerges in the economic field but does not end there. It spreads to the entire social fabric and affects the cultural  ideological and political fields.159.	The multi centered world that is emerging today must  as it does  show an equal multiplicity of structures in the economic fields  where the process of political detente must also be reflected. But if this were not enough to contribute to an improvement in the conditions of development of the third world  then we could not  in justice  contend that the risks of a conflict have diminished. For peace and prosperity that are founded on a position of structured under-development at the international level will always be precarious  no matter how noble and worthy the political and trade agreements worked out by the major Powers.160.	The results of the three sessions held by UNCTAD  and especially that held this year in Santiago  have convinced us of the need to restate their supporting rationale in order to restore the mystique that surrounded them at the outset and that aroused so many hopes in our hearts.161.	Within a new articulation of the world's economic affairs the third world must devise a consistent and united strategy that will make of it a single and sufficiently powerful unit. Our countries should continue to group together on the basis of productive interests  in order to acquire genuine negotiating strength that will ensure better prices for our products. This in turn will lead to our increased participation in the profit earned from trade in those products and thus we shall be in a position to recover sovereign control over the natural resources which give rise to that wealth.162.	In the circle of domination and dependence which characterizes the structure of the relations .between developing and more industrialized nations  there is an element of distortion that contributes to imbalance  I refer to the multinational corporations on firms which have acquired a marked economic  financial and political influence in States  whose participation in world trade and capital flow is much larger than that of many countries  and which very often evade the traditional pattern of payments. The third session of UNCTAD showed the growing preponderance of these corporations that control between 20 and 30 per cent of the output of world trade  and alarm was expressed over their speculative role in the world monetary crisis.163.	Thus far  the United Nations has not been able to deal with this important aspect of development but this failure will allegedly be corrected by means of resolution 1721 (LIII)  recently adopted by the Social Council  which requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to designate a group of experts to study the behavior of such multinational corporations  particularly in the developing countries  and their impact on international relations  so that their recommendations may guide Governments both in the adoption of sovereign decisions and in agreeing on appropriate international action.164.	In the light of all these circumstances  which clearly highlight the problem of under-development and in the light of the political and economic reality which determines and conditions under-development  a most valuable initiative emerged from the third session of UNCTAD  namely  the idea of preparing a charter of the economic rights and duties of States and of establishing the relevant machinery for such a Charter. At the sUbregional  regional and world levels  Peru has taken an active and constant part in the laying down of principles to govern economic relations among States  and we are ready to participate also in this fundamental task of creating an appropriate international legal framework.165.	The monetary crisis  its restrictive effects on trade and finance  and the Smithsonian Agreement  adopted without the participation of the developing countries  have had consequences that are prejudicial to the countries of the third world through their net losses in their dollar reserves as a result of the readjustment of exchange rates and other unfavorable developments in their terms of trade as well as the burden of foreign debts.166.	The need to ensure the participation of the developing countries at the decision-making level in monetary and trade questions of vital importance to the international community was the purpose of the initiative strongly urged by Peru in the Group of 77 developing countries concerning the creation of an intergovernmental group on monetary questions. The final constitution of the group and the important recommendations made therein are to be presented now to the Committee of 20  established by the International Monetary Fund. We trust that an over-all solution to the monetary problem will be found through that group. If not  it will inevitably have to be sought in a world monetary conference  as was initially proposed by Peru.167.	With regard to the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations to be held in 1973 within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  the developing world has clearly defined the- principles that must govern the talks to avoid the marginalization of which it was the victim at the time of the last Kennedy Round. A further postponement would have dire effects on the economies of the members of the Group of 77 and  hence  on the welfare and progress of more than two thirds of mankind.168.	International assistance is a duty and not philanthropy. Through it  the industrialized nations return a minimal part of what we have unquestionably provided them for the consolidation of their development and power. Aid  in order to deserve that name  must be free and not subject to contractual conditions. Peru rejects the type of assistance that is burdensome  that carries conditions and is provided on terms of political and economic subjugation  for it then becomes a pressure tool to bend the will of the needy countries against their own interests. Far from encouraging development  such assistance generates further poverty and dependency and belies the most elementary principles of international co-operation  which is intended to channel multilateral aid that should be accompanied by safeguards for sufficient decision-making power without the existence of pressures of any kind. My country  from its own experience  knows the stumbling blocks and difficulties encountered by requests for financing submitted by countries seriously embarked upon an independent course of development.169.	But assistance must also be sufficient to reach the targets set by this Assembly itself for the Second United Nations Development Decade. According to the Assembly official financial assistance to the third world should be equal to 0.7 per cent of a country's gross national product.170.	Although some industrialized countries have advanced towards this goal  the President of the World Bank himself has admitted that by 1975 average official assistance will have reached merely 0.35 per cent  that is  half of the target for the Second Development Decade. Yet this is happening at a time when the gross national product of the industrialized countries is increasing rapidly  leaving the developing countries behind and  most important of all  dramatically widening the gap between the wealthy and the poor countries of the world.171.	Obviously  this situation cannot continue indefinitely and if the flow of official financial assistance settles at a level that is considerably below the target set for the Decade  which seems likely at present  then the international community will sooner or later have to face the need to reassess and restructure the terms of foreign indebtedness of the developing countries  whose fledgling economies will no longer be able to carry the burden of a growing mortgage upon their income  which is  unfortunately  all too often the experience of the countries which make up the third world.172.	Regarding the question of the law of the sea  events have taken place that are important for the nations that would establish a just order for the use and exploitation of the oceans.173.	The People's Republic of China in the United Nations  jurists of Asian and African countries at Lagos  the participants in the meetings of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination of the Group of 77  and of the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Caribbean  as well as the recent official statement of the Government of Cuba all  in one way or another  reaffirm the right of coastal States to dispose of the marine resources within the Emits of their national jurisdiction limits which an increasing number of nations have proposed should be set up to 200 miles. UNCTAD included this right among its new principles. Support for this view was voiced anew by numerous countries from the various continents at the recent meetings of the Committee on the sea-bed designed to prepare for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. To all this must now be added the latest proclamations from the Governments of Gabon  Mauritania and Oman that extend the exercise of their jurisdiction beyond 12 miles and  in particular  the courageous attitude of the Government of Iceland to which my country reiterates its solidarity on this occasion.174.	The facts mentioned are tangible and conclusive proof of the degree of international support achieved for the maritime doctrine which establishes a 200-mile limit in the new law of the sea.175.	However  this vigorous trend does not seem to have been fully understood in all its implications by a small group of maritime Powers which are determined to establish a narrow zone of coastal jurisdiction in order to be free to exploit foreign waters at will.176.	In any case  I believe it appropriate at this time to dispel any possible doubts on the issue by reiterating here the firm and unwavering position of Peru to maintain  and enforce respect for  our sovereignty and jurisdiction over the waters adjacent to our coast  including the soil and subsoil thereof to a distance of up to 200 miles  in order to promote the development and well-being of our people. This decision  not only adopted by the Government of Peru  but also shared by the Peruvian people as a whole for 25 years now  rests upon basic geographical  ecological  economic  social  political and juridical foundations that have been set forth at length in different international bodies and whose validity cannot be ignored since they flow from a law of nature and considerations of justice that must prevail over mercantile designs or the desire for hegemony of faraway nations  regardless of how powerful they may be.177.	The resources of the bountiful fishing grounds lying off the coast of Peru whose existence would seem to be a form of compensation for the same natural conditions which determine the aridity of our coasts-are and will always be considered by Peru as an integral part of our nation's wealth whose use by our people no nation has the right to dispute. Let none believe that this truth-and this determination which is irrevocable can ever be flouted as long as one single Peruvian lives.178.	The detente that is today clearly evident  has still not dissipated man's feeling that he is still living in the shadow of fear. The end of the dualist and antagonistic division of the world has in no way meant the end of power politics and confrontations which conditioned international relations over the last decades.179.	Neither the sparse results of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva nor the negotiations at the highest level between the super-Powers have given sufficient hopes for a solution to the world disarmament problem. Furthermore  there seems to be every indication of a lack of a definite will to assert a realistic and honest policy which would lead to final disarmament.180.	Furthermore  we cannot fail to mention-or  one might better say  to denounce the tendency among certain Powers to accuse the developing countries of fomenting arms races among themselves. Behind this fallacious allegation lies the definite purpose of disguising  on the one hand  the magnitude of their own burdensome expenditures and also  and perhaps primarily  of shifting the responsibility that they bear for the development of the poorer countries. I repeat here  we consider that security is conditioned by development and  therefore  it is not in our interest to expend enormous amounts on armaments.181.	The great Powers  dominated as they are by the tyranny of technology  spend enormous amounts modernizing their weaponry without considering the already precarious state of world security and certainly without a thought for the legitimate rights and interests of the nations of the third world. My Government therefore supports a restructuring of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to provide for the participation of all the nuclear Powers  and an increase in its membership so as to allow equitable representation for developing countries.182.	If we have stated that the development of nations is closely linked to international security  it is obvious that world disarmament  and therefore nuclear disarmament  is the basic goal of all mankind at present. The vast sums spent on these activities and the dangers they represent to the human environment have repeatedly been considered by the international community in this Assembly and in other forums  such as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm last June  where we have asked for a condemnation of and a halt to nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere.183.	Regrettably  we find that in the programs for nuclear weapon testing in the South Pacific  the announcement of a final suspension of tests in the atmosphere to be carried out over the Mururoa Atoll in the future has not been forthcoming. Peru once again condemns these tests and we shall continue to bend every possible effort to insure a cancellation of such nuclear tests which are undoubtedly a danger to mankind.184.	At the present juncture in international affairs  Peru is following with great interest and  as is only natural  supports the general trend towards a relaxation of tension  as reflected in the establishment of talks at the highest level between China and the United States  in the Berlin agreements and in the understandings between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea on the independent and peaceful reunification of the country without interference by any foreign State. We are also encouraged by the agreement reached by Pakistan and India on a withdrawal of troops from the Asian subcontinent.185.	The process of relaxation of tension which extends also to the European scene calls for a re-evaluation of the specific political and economic situation in that continent. This would seem to indicate the need for the holding of a conference on European security and co-operation which will doubtless spell the beginning of a new era in the relations among countries of the continent  the ramifications of which will affect the whole world.186.	We are attending a new session of the General Assembly  and so far no peace has yet been achieved in the Middle East. Despite the efforts of this Organization  Security Council resolution 242 (1967) has still not been implemented. We repeat to this Assembly our conviction that any solution that we attempt to provide for the conflict in the Middle East must be fitted into the framework of that resolution if guarantees of lasting peace are to be achieved.187.	We also consider it of the highest importance that the Suez Canal should be reopened  as was stated at the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 and at the third session of UNCTAD. The continued closure of the Canal causes considerable damage to the economy of the area.188.	In Asia  the Viet-Nam conflict shows no sign of ending soon. The forces involved continue their bloody struggle  magnified now by the use of sophisticated weapons. No thought is given to the terrible sufferings of a people that will not forget the horrors of this holocaust for centuries to come.189.	The Revolutionary Government of Peru considers that in the case of Viet-Nam no matter what solution may be considered to end the war  it will obviously have to be based upon the exclusion of intervention by other countries  so that the people of Viet-Nam will thus be able to exercise its right to self-determination.190.	Peru will support any endeavor designed to have our Organization assume its proper role in the urgent search for solutions to put an end to that conflict  consonant with the purposes and principles of the Charter.191.	The threat to world peace and security as well as to the effectiveness of this Organization as an instrument for the peaceful settlement of international disputes becomes more acute in the face of persistent problems such as colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid.192.	Thus  consistent with its own traditions and its sincere belief in social justice  Peru reiterates its support for the Security Council resolutions condemning all colonialist policies and reaffirming the application of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia  as well as the resolutions of the General Assembly which repudiate all forms of racial discrimination and apartheid.193.	The world as a whole was shaken by the tragic events that took place during the recent Olympic games. These events only strengthen the views of those who affirm that the present world  in a paradoxical way  is generating an infernal dialectic of violence to combat violence.194.	The Peruvian Government morally repudiates acts of international terrorism which convert any region of the world  including countries that are not parties to any dispute  into zones of irrational and pointless violence. My country has therefore always advocated in absolutely clear terms international arrangements within this Organization to increase security in the world.195.	My country understands that very often violence is only a mistaken outlet for despair originating  perhaps  in conditions incompatible with the human condition. Social and economic conditions and the frustration of the just aspirations of peoples play an important role in this reaction.196.	Peru condemns these acts recently committed against innocent victims  and also voices the most severe censure against other forms of violence that seek to obtain through vengeance what ought to be claimed from the human justice and the conscience of nations.197.	The United Nations should become the definite means of reaching understanding among men and peoples; one through which differences will be overcome through a new approach  one by whose help the contradictions of wealth and poverty  development and under-development  will become less deep and lead to the humanization of men of all latitudes.198.	In the era of revolutionary change in which we live an era in which ideas and customs  concepts and actions are questioned in depth the United Nations continues to provide the best and most appropriate framework for harmonizing change and overcoming conflict. The limitations in which this work is carried out do not detract from its importance or weaken our faith. The inconsistency between the lofty aims of the Organization and much postponed justice confirm our certainty that no solutions are possible without the will and true agreement of the parties involved.199.	Now that a better disposition toward dialog and coexistence seems perceptible among nations in a spirit of understanding and respect for a reality consisting of a plurality of concepts and ideologies  we believe that Organization can fulfill its mission and come closer to its lofty aims. It is because of this that the people and Government of Peru sincerely renew once again their very firm and convinced adherence to the principles of the Charter and their confidence in the destiny of the Organization."
"92",5556,"PHL",27,1972,"General debates have traditionally been occasions for stock-taking  for reflecting upon the state of the world and of the United Nations  and for giving voice at this universal forum to the needs and aspirations of mankind. As we approach the end of this particular general debate  we find the balance sheet a sobering blend of hope and concern.153.	The two super-Powers have taken an important step to control the nuclear armaments race by agreeing to quantitative limits on strategic nuclear weapons. Yet their competition for qualitative supremacy in nuclear weaponry continues  precluding substantial reductions in their armament budgets. And while expectations of progress towards disarmament are prominently projected  there is a significant silence on the use of the immense savings that would accrue from disarmament.154.	The great hope of the poor countries  repeatedly expressed in this Assembly over the years  that a substantial part of savings from disarmament should be committed to development aid thus remains a remote  if not indeed an illusory  hope. The link which the developing countries have sought to establish between the two major undertakings of the United Nations in the 1970s the Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade  remains tenuous at best.155.	The welcome detente in Europe has undoubtedly reduced international tensions on that continent  one which has the dubious distinction of having produced two world wars and still has the potential to ignite a third one in this century. Yet nuclear proliferation continues in Europe  and one of Europe's leading countries has persisted in conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean in disregard of the United Nations ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere and under water and in defiance of world public opinion and the indignant protests of the countries in the area  which rightly argue that  if such nuclear tests are as harmless as they are claimed to be  there is no reason not to conduct them in the Atlantic Ocean  or for that matter  off the famous Riviera  where they might serve as an additional tourist attraction.156.	Next door  in the Middle East  not only has peace remained out of reach but the jockeying among the great Powers for positions of advantage and influence in the continuing crisis has not abated. Nor have the sales and supplies of arms to the combatant countries been stopped. This is a factor worth pondering in connexion with the proposal  laudable in its avowed purpose  for the non-use of force in international disputes. Does this proposal simply mean that the great Powers should refrain from attacking one another directly? Should it not  rather  be carried a step further and taken to mean that the great Powers should not abet the use of force by lesser Powers through the convenient device of selling or supplying arms to them? In other words  is it not about time that the great Powers  unable to attack one another directly without mortal danger to themselves  ceased to practice wars by proxy  by using the third world as a cockpit for their persisting ambitions for regional or global hegemony?157.	We have noted the developing detente in Europe  but what of other regions peace being all the more indivisible now in our ever more tightly interdependent world?158.	Latin America is in the throes of a social revolution which is unfolding within the framework of its deeply ingrained sense of solidarity  its cherished traditions of justice and responsible order and its strong desire to make its full contribution to international peace and well-being.159.	Africa continues its uncompromising struggle against apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination  hand in hand with its struggle  no less uncompromising  against the remaining strongholds of colonialism. These are struggles to which the Philippines  with its own experience of nearly four centuries of colonialism and of exploitation by foreign Powers  cannot remain indifferent; indeed we have time and again manifested our solidarity with our African friends on these fundamental issues  which touch the very heart of the United Nations Charter.160.	What of our own region of Asia? In Asia  too  signs of detente have been detected. An auspicious beginning has been made towards a peace settlement between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has been recognized as an independent nation by many countries  although  regrettably  it has not yet been admitted into the United Nations. South Korea and North Korea are embarked on a fateful dialog that could conceivably lead to the agreed and peaceful reunification ardently desired by the Korean people. China and Japan have reached agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations  a step of far-reaching significance. But the tragic war in Indochina continues  with no just end as yet clearly in sight. Great Power moves to fill expected vacuums of power in the Asian region persist. There is no assurance that Asia can soon achieve the conditions of peace and stability which it so sorely needs and which found poignant expression last year in the Declaration issued at Kuala Lumpur by the Foreign Ministers of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] - Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailand - that their countries were ""determined to exert initially necessary efforts to secure the recognition of and respect for South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers"". 161.	In the last several years the Philippines has increasingly emphasized its participation in regional groups organized in accordance with the Charter  most notably in the sphere of economic  social and cultural co-operation. There have been significant shifts in orientation in the two most important regional groupings of which we are a member. In the Asian and Pacific Council there is fresh emphasis on economic development  brought about by new developments in Asia  principally by the developing detente and the consequent realignment of forces in the area. In ASEAN  more decisive initiatives are being undertaken to promote closer regional collaboration. Early this year ASEAN took a giant step forward in its co-operative endeavors. It approved a plan for the liberalization of trade on a selective basis and another plan for industrial complementation on a similar selective basis.162.	Heretofore ASEAN had been a collection of separate co-operative endeavors. Although these areas of cooperation were and are important in themselves and have proved a great practical benefit to the region in such diverse fields as the development of tourism  the utilization of available technology and cultural exchanges  the economic agreement recently concluded is bound to be regarded as the hub of ASEAN activities. It is perhaps sanguine to speak of a common market in connexion with South-East Asia at this point in time  but the complementation plan drafted with the help of the United Nations may correctly be viewed as the fore-runner of an important scheme for regional economic integration. If it succeeds  it will doubtless become a landmark in Asian economic cooperation and it will have its particular contribution to make to the world economic situation.163.	The five member countries rely on ASEAN and will do so in the future to a degree which none of them had anticipated. Unless the international economic situation improves markedly for the developing countries  the members of ASEAN will feel increasingly that the maximum opportunities for co-operation with the rest of the world could best be achieved through regional rather than individual national efforts. Looking towards this possibility  ASEAN has begun exploratory conversations with the European Economic Community with the objective of improving the deteriorating market for its export commodities.164.	Thus  ASEAN is proof that the habit of co-operation can be fruitfully developed  even among countries with diverse traditional backgrounds. Less than six years after its founding  ASEAN is beginning to develop a personality of its own and to exert a modest force in Asian affairs. A few years ago the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries agreed to try to help in mediating the Cambodian conflict. This year the same Foreign Ministers  in a move expressive of their deep concern over the war in Viet-Nam  proposed a formula which the parties to the conflict could consider as a means of breaking the impasse in current negotiations. We shall do so again  taking into account the objections voiced by the parties principally concerned  in the belief that the Asian voice is not irrelevant in a war being fought on Asian soil which causes a grievous toll in Asian lives.165.	The modest achievements of ASEAN are a source of pride to its member countries  which regard them as reassuring auguries of more important future accomplishments; ASEAN's progress could be enhanced and accelerated in the hoped-for climate of peace and stability for Asia to which I have referred.166.	Modest innovations recently undertaken by the United Nations have  in the view of my Government  been worth while. We are referring specifically to the reinstitution of periodic meetings of the Security Council and to the meetings of the Council held in Africa. Occasional such meetings in various parts of the globe can help to highlight and bring new efforts to bear on the problems of the region. In this connexion  the Philippine Government suggests that the Security Council should give consideration to a meeting in the near future in Asia. Asia is in a state of flux and change  and yet at the very time when there is so much new promise in Asian affairs the region remains beset by enormous problems. The effort to come to grips with both the difficulties and the new opportunities could be raised to a new level  where new perspectives could be brought to bear  in our view  by a meeting of the Security Council in Asia.167.	Peace and non-interference by outside Powers these are two of the things beyond price which the developing countries of Asia need today: peace  because in the absence of the danger of aggression we can devote more of our resources to the pressing task of development to fulfill our peoples just desire for a better life; non-interference by outside Powers  because externally inspired and supported subversion is still one of the most serious problems confronting the developing countries in Asia.168.	In the Philippines this particular problem reached a state of extreme gravity last month and impelled President Marcos to invoke the authority vested in him by the Philippine Constitution to proclaim martial law. The President's immediate purpose was to safeguard the Republic of the Philippines from violent overthrow by subversive groups operating with external support. But he has also seized the opportunity to set in train urgently needed meas"" res to eliminate the inequities in Philippine society by means of a thorough reform and restructuring of social  political and economic institutions that had not been sufficiently responsive to the urgent need for social justice. Significantly  one of the very first decisions was to declare the entire Philippines a land-reform area.169.	The seriousness of the Philippine situation was aggravated by the occurrence last July of the worst flood disaster in Philippine history. Over an area in which the average rainfall was 100 inches  75 inches of rain fell in one single week  and the rainfall lasted for three weeks  flooding almost the entire vast fertile central plain of Luzon  which is known as the ""rice bowl"" or ""rice granary"" of the Philippines. Highly productive rice farms  sugar land  fish ponds  houses  infrastructures and industrial complexes- even the metes and bounds of private property were obliterated or damaged to an extent which may set back our development efforts for three to five years. The flood victims numbered more than 2 million persons out of the disaster area's total population of 7 million; but statistical figures alone cannot really measure the immensity of the human cost of the calamity.170.	It was in the wake of the widespread material devastation and human suffering caused by that unprecedented flood disaster that the subversive groups in thePhilippines intensified their attempts to sow panic and undermine the conditions of law and order indispensable to effective reconstruction work  leaving President Marcos no alternative but to declare martial law.171.	At this point  I should like to place on record the profound gratitude of the Government and people of the Philippines for the assistance given to the flood disaster victims which we received from all quarters and not only from Governments with which we have diplomatic relations  but also from countries with which we have not as yet established such relations  such as the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  both of which gave us generous and welcome assistance.172.	The International Red Cross and its affiliates  true to an old and honored tradition  responded immediately with emergency aid. So did the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEFJ with its ready supplies  its action-oriented approach  and its wealth of experience in coping with emergency situations. The World Food Program  the Economic and Social Council  the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] also rose admirably to the occasion  and the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator  Ambassador Farouk Berkol  faced with his first major challenge  acquitted himself in commendable fashion and vindicated the wisdom of the Assembly in establishing his Office last year. The Secretariat staff and many individual contributors  in a spontaneous gesture of sympathy  collected a substantial contribution  which the Secretary-General himself transmitted to the Philippine National Red Cross through the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.173.	I have referred in some detail to the various United Nations agencies that extended assistance to the Philippines in its hour of need  because it illustrates the great constructive potential of the United Nations in assisting countries to cope with natural disasters. The Philippine delegation hopes to enhance this potential with a new proposal  following up the initiative it took at the twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly on the role of the World Meteorological Organization [WMOJ in ""discovering ways and means to mitigate the harmful effects of... storms and remove or minimize their destructive potentials"". Our new proposal will take the form of a draft resolution entitled ""International action on the mitigation of the harmful effects of storms"". Its principal aim will be to bring about integrated action through increased cooperation and co-ordination among the WMO  the UNDP and the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator in the field of United Nations natural disaster assistance  particularly the prevention  prediction and control of natural disasters.174.	We hope that this Philippine proposal will attract a good number of other sponsors and that it will merit the unanimous approval of this Assembly.175.	Terrorism is on our agenda [item 92]  and rightly so. Criminal acts of individuals or groups of individuals against the innocent can never be condoned by the international society  and every possible resource must be mobilized to end and prevent them. Thus  it will be remembered  thePhilippine delegation last year exerted itself particularly in the effort to develop effective means to end the hijacking of aircraft  and the Republic of the Philippines is at present taking extraordinary measures to meet similar threats at home. To the extent that acts of terrorism are irrational and aberrant reactions to resolved international differences  they should now be excused  and must be condemned. But we must at the same time accept the responsibility of renewing our efforts to solve these disputes. We cannot claim to be blameless until we have exerted ourselves to the utmost to solve these disputes.176.	The United Nations  of course  has an immense potential for constructive work in every field of international activity  and it is one of the most lamentable facts of our time that this potential has never been fully used. The great Powers have never given to the United Nations the full measure of faith and support which it needs and deserves in order to attain the great goals of the Charter. During this general debate this Assembly hall has resounded again and again with commendatory references to vital prospects of detente  historic summit meetings  bold initiatives to inaugurate an era of negotiation in lieu of confrontation  and actual agreements on nuclear weapons control. And all of these  sad to admit  have come to pass outside the United Nations auspices. When it should be playing a central role in the efforts to achieve one of the primary aims of the Charter  the United Nations has been shunted off to to the periphery of major developments in the field of international security.177.	A great opportunity was missed in the first year of the United Nations  when the great Powers failed to unite in support of the Charter's aims ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained"". They indulged  instead  in the dangerous and sterile cold war.178.	What a vastly different world we would now have if the great Powers had channeled even a modest portion of the immense resources which they expended on the cold war to the United Nations in order to achieve the Charter's aim ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom""  thereby giving substance to the other primary aim of the Charter: ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".179.	Is it still possible for the United Nations to have a second chance to fulfill its function of effectively helping to achieve the goals of the Charter? The latest report of the President of the World Bank Group  Mr. Robert McNamara  suggests that it is almost too late. In his address to the recently concluded meeting of the World Bank Group he said and members of this Assembly should listen carefully to his words:""With the [Official Development Assistance] only half achieved  the poorer nations have almost no hope of attaining the 6 per cent growth target. That will condemn them to so slow an economic advance over the decade that hundreds of millions of individuals within these countries will be able to detect virtually no improvement whatever in their desperately low standards of living. Their per capita incomes will rise by no more than two dollars a year."" Those are the words of Mr. McNamara. I quote him again:""Projected to the end of the century only a generation away that means the people of the developed counties will be enjoying per capita incomes  in 1972 prices  of over $8 000 a year  while these masses of the poor... will on average receive less than $200 per capita  and some 800 million will receive less than $100."" In other words  the infamous poverty gap is widening at an accelerated rate and the poor  developing countries are in fact on the verge of living in a global ghetto  with all the ominous implications of such a situation  one of which the President of the World Bank spells out in these fateful words:""If the rich nations do not act-through both aid and trade to diminish the widening imbalance between their own collective wealth and the aggregate poverty of the poor nations  development simply cannot succeed within any acceptable time frame. The community of nations will only become more dangerously fragmented into the privileged and the deprived  the self-satisfied and the frustrated  the complacent and the bitter. It will not be an international atmosphere conducive to tranquility."" And Mr. McNamara emphasizes: ""The developed nations  then  must do more to promote at least minimal equity in the distribution of wealth among nations."" 180.	In this context the decline in international cooperation for development has ominous implications not only for the prosperity but also for the prospects of a stable and enduring peace in the world. The decrease  actual and proposed  in the budgetary support of some countries for the United Nations and its family of agencies is discouraging enough. But even more disheartening is the prospect that voluntary contributions of some affluent countries to such vital United Nations agencies as UNICEF and the UNDP may either stagnate or also be reduced.181.	As one of the ""founding fathers"" of the United Nations  I sincerely hope that these apprehensions will prove to be groundless. All the great new issues developing in the United Nations underline the undeniable oneness of the human family  the inseparable unity of mankind's destiny on this fragile  finite and vulnerable planet earth.182.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  which achieved great success despite the formidable difficulties it had to overcome  brought home the sobering fact that we have only one earth and that we must act as one community to safeguard and nourish its life-support systems.183.	The declaration by the Secretary-General on 20 September 1972 that 1974 will be observed as World Population Year is a cogent reminder that the earth's resources are limited and that population planning is indispensable to the preservation of the human species and the enhancement of the quality of life in the world. The Philippine delegation is gratified at the outstanding success of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in effectively conveying this message and is prepared to give its full support to the World Population Year's program.184.	The preparatory meetings for the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea pointedly remind us that sea and ocean resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are part of the common heritage of mankind.185.	The imperatives of preserving human life and enhancing its quality in a relatively small  crowded earth with finite resources are pushing us inexorably to consider seriously the necessity of subordinating narrow nationalistic self-interest to the larger requirements of mankind. The United Nations is an indispensable instrument in this inherently difficult  perhaps slow  and certainly painful  transition.186.	The United Nations is here; <t is ready and eager to serve; arid it is at our disposal. Let us give it a second chance to play the central role in international affairs that the Charter intended for it. As we have repeatedly proposed  let us amend the Charter  if risible  in order to make the United Nations more effective and more responsive to the needs and the problems of today. It is axiomatic that the General Assembly provides the opportunity only for the most general assessment. The kind of deliberate consideration required to a change in the Charter can only take place in a proper body constituted for that purpose. The Government of the Philippines is ready to join in recommending that a proper forum be established by the Assembly for a careful consideration of those specific suggestions which have been made or will be made in more detail by Member Governments and qualified experts. A small but broadly representative body would sift in orderly fashion the various suggestions put forward and develop a picture of the range of agreement which exists. Those suggestions commanding broad support would be acted upon in due time for two major deliberative organs of the United Nations.187.	Support for a considered examination of the world Organization's Charter and an evaluation of its effectiveness in meeting the new challenges of today has come from widely diverse quarters from Member States large and small. There is a wide-spread commitment to examine with care whatever specific proposals may be advanced. This is true  for instance  of the reply of the United States [ A[8746/Add. 1]  a major founding Member  and also true of the vigorous statement made here in this Assembly by the People's Republic of China [2051st meeting]  which is the newest major Member of our Organization to assume its seat.188.	In the meantime  let us make full use of the United Nations as it is and give it our complete support. Now is a propitious time to begin. We have an energetic  perceptive  resourceful President of the General Assembly  who has already shown himself to be worthy of the example set by his most distinguished predecessors  the latest being the eminent Indonesian statesman  Foreign Minister Adarn Malik.189.	And as the successor of our highly esteemed former Secretary-General U Thant  whose sterling worth is indicated by his success in holding ""the most impossible job in the world"" for over 10 years  we are most fortunate in having Mr. Kurt Waldheim  a man of outstanding vision  integrity and moral courage. Mr. Waldheim is that rare combination of a man of wisdom and a man of action a Secretary-General who is not afraid to take initiatives  to offer his good offices  to practice quiet diplomacy or to speak out clearly and frankly when in his judgment his duties under the Charter require him to do so. He has our full confidence and support.190.	To sum up our general debate  each year as we gather here to review the problems and the prospects in international affairs  we cannot help being struck by how radically our world has changed in one year's time. What was seen as tentative and problematical in one year has become the immediate reality of the next. A year ago we were preparing for the conference on the environment in Stockholm. Today  following the enormous success of that conference  we have a new and deeper appreciation of the individuality of the earth's biosphere that thin envelope that alone supports life  not just human life but all life. We have acquired in one short year a more profound under-standing of our fundamental interdependence.191.	In the political realm  in the relations between nations  we have witnessed a no less astounding and vital leap forward toward accommodation an accommodation which  again  has the same roots  conscious or not  in a growing awareness of the essentially of the interdependence of man if we are to have a viable future at all.192.	Each of these vital issues seems to illustrate once again how we are moving into an era of collective responsibility for the globe and its peoples. While maintaining the rich cultural heritage and unique individuality of nations and races  we must by conscious effort surmount the narrow parochialism of unilateral national action whenever it impinges on the well-being of the world as a whole. It is in this light that my Government chooses to view each action taken by our world Organization  holding the firm conviction that with each step will come the insight that will guide us yet further in the harmonization of human affairs."
"93",5662,"POL",27,1972,"Comrade President  on behalf of the Polish delegation and on my own behalf I wish to offer you heartfelt congratulations upon your election to the high post of President of the present session. Your election is viewed by the Polish delegation as an expression of the appreciation by the United Nations of the peaceful and constructive work of the Polish People's Republic at the international level.55.	May I now be permitted to present Poland's position on some of the key issues facing the international community today.56.	At the present session of the General Assembly  Poland can note with satisfaction the favorable direction in which the international situation is developing in Europe. This direction was determined by such events as the coming into force of the Treaties between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany  and between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany   the four-Power agreement on West Berlin  and the agreement concluded on this question between the two German States on 17 December 1971 and that concluded between the German Democratic Republic and the Senate of West Berlin on 20 December 1971.57.	The recognition of political and territorial realities which resulted from the defeat of the Third Reich reflected in those agreements provides a good point of departure from which the situation can evolve towards detente and a basis for the strengthening of security and for the consolidation of peaceful co-operation.58.	This is all the more important in so far as in the past  owing to historical factors  a number of antagonisms were built up in Europe which culminated in two World Wars in the course of this century. After the Second World War  along the line where the two largest military and political blocs of the contemporary world meet-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization- there were recurring and dangerous tensions  to mention only those relating to West Berlin.59.	Of the European antagonisms  the centuries-old German-Polish conflict engendered by the eastward pressure of German aggressive forces was especially acute. It was no coincidence that the Second World War began with the aggression launched by the Nazi Reich against Poland.60.	Poland's western frontier on the Oder and the Lusatian Neisse established by the Potsdam Agreement of 1 August 1945 eliminated the territorial consequences of the expansion of German imperialism and created possibilities for shaping relations in Central Europe on a new foundation. Poland's neighbor  the German Democratic Republic  had drawn the correct conclusions and recognized that frontier in the Zgorzelec Agreement of 1950  which created the foundation of relations of real friendship between Poland and the German Democratic Republic. In the Treaty on the Bases for the Normalization of Relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany  the Federal Republic of Germany  too  recognized this frontier as inviolable  thus providing a final settlement of the question of the recognition of Poland's western frontier in accordance with international law and thereby creating a basis for the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany. The recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the two States constitutes another step in this direction. This agreement proves that there are no international problems so complex as to defy solution by negotiation if all the parties concerned have a will and determination to find a solution.61.	The fact that the question of frontiers has been settled once and for all is a historical victory for the positions held by the Polish people. It is also a victory for the cause of peace inasmuch as any attempt to infringe upon our territorial integrity would constitute a threat to peace in Europe and in the world. It is also a victory for all those nations and Governments that have been providing us with their moral assistance and direct support in our efforts to gain recognition of the Polish western frontier. I wish on behalf of the Polish people to offer our warm thanks to those nations and Governments.62.	The normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic is now becoming the order of the day. Complete normalization of their relations should be achieved as soon as possible on the basis of the generally accepted standards of international law. It is now a glaring anomaly that the German Democratic Republic should still be discriminated against. It is becoming perfectly obvious that no major European problem can be solved effectively without the participation  in accordance with the principle of equal rights  of that socialist German State  which lies in the very heartland of Europe and has a vast economic potential. Poland is of the opinion that conditions are now ripe for the simultaneous admission of the two German States to the United Nations.63.	The speedy normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and Czechoslovakia is also necessary.64.	The favorable political developments in Europe which I mentioned earlier facilitated the commencement of7 Agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the Republic of Poland regarding the Demarcation of the German-Polish Frontier  signed at Zgorzelec on 6 July 1950 multilateral preparatory talks on holding a European conference  with the participation of the United States and Canada  which could start constructing a lasting system of security and co-operation throughout the whole of Europe.65.	Poland's special involvement in  and active work for  European security stems from her historical experience. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  for nearly a century and a half  Poland was deprived of independent existence as a sovereign State. Subsequently  after 20 years of independence  it fell victim to Nazi aggression  and paid an extremely high price to regain its freedom and independence. For Poland  then  security and the opportunity for international co-operation are of basic importance.66.	But there still exist certain political forces in Europe which stake their future on the continuation of tensions and artificial dividing-lines. Such a development in European relations  however  is contrary to the universal desire of peoples for the peaceful coexistence of nations  since wide segments of the people in all European countries  as well as among their ruling circles  are beginning to realize that all European States  regardless of the differences in their systems  have a common interest in striving for peaceful and secure development  There is a growing conviction that to safeguard these common fundamental interests in existing conditions is not only necessary but also practicable through our common efforts and a constructive program of action.67.	The Soviet Union  Poland and other socialist countries have long been proposing such a program. A number of documents issued jointly by the socialist States  and in particular the latest document adopted in Prague last January by the Political Advisory Committee of States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  elaborated further on this program and made it more concrete  thus providing a platform for a more lively dialog which has confirmed the desirability of convening a European conference on security and co-operation.68.	In our opinion  conditions have now been created in Europe for the establishment of a system of commitments to safeguard the inviolability of existing frontiers and ensure respect for the territorial integrity of all States  the non-use of force and the elimination of the threat of its use in inter-State relations  while confirming the principles of the equality and sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.69.	At present conditions are ripe for the acceleration of steps to expand co-operation among all European States in the fields of economy  science  technology  culture and protection of the natural environment. However  such co-operation will be fully beneficial only when the old model of relations based on the armaments race and a balance of fear between opposing military and political blocs is replaced by an all-European system of collective security.70.	Much still remains to be done in the field of the expansion of free trade in Europe. The abolition of import-export restrictions is one of the first steps that must be taken towards this goal.71.	The two integrated economic structures which are developing in Europe the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community-being the result of an objective process of economic integration do not by themselves constitute an obstacle to inter-European co-operation. However  impediments arise when  for political reasons  West European integration implies discrimination against non-member partners and the disruption of the natural inter-European ties. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  in its forms of economic integration  is free from any discriminatory practices vis-a-vis non-member partners. We expect the member States of the European Economic Community to respect such principles inasmuch as it is only such all-round co-operation that can gradually bring about changes in psychological attitudes and in the minds of people  thus closing the gap of mistrust between them. Such co-operation would also facilitate progress in the field of disarmament  leading to the allocation of major means for the settlement of the urgent economic and social problems of our planet.72.	Poland desires to contribute most constructively to the new era beginning in Europe and to the vision of the future of Europe which is now emerging.73.	For many years now Poland has been building relations with numerous West European States on the principles of peaceful coexistence. Relations between Poland and France are developing very well indeed. The traditional ties of friendship linking our two peoples are being transformed into ever more constructive co-operation in many fields  benefiting both Poland and France. Similarly  Poland is shaping her relations with the Nordic States  with which for quite some time we have been engaged in a useful dialog regarding European issues and with which we have enjoyed advantageous co-operation which is developing well in the fields of economy and culture and in other areas of interest.74.	Guided by our concern for the security and peaceful development of Europe we have begun the process of normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany relations which are severely affected by the tragic historical experience of the Polish nation. We were gratified to see the positive evolution of the policies of the Federal Republic of Germany and the contribution of the Brandt Scheel Government to the detente in Europe  expressed in the recognition of realities indispensable to the present and future development of interState relations in central Europe. This  despite the retrograde forces of opposition which are active in that State  justifies our approaching with confidence the settling of the bilateral problems which confront us in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Treaty concluded by our two States.75.	We wish to expand dynamically  as in the past  our relations with Italy  the Benelux countries  neutral Austria and other European countries as well.76.	I have been discussing these matters primarily in the European context. One of the reasons for this approach is my belief that the comprehensive form for co-operation in resolving numerous problems within the framework of the European continent can and should play a positive role in stimulating co-operation with States in other parts of our globe  and first and foremost with the developing countries.77.	We attach major importance to the systematic cementing of political  economic and cultural bonds with the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. Mindful of the ambitious developmental aspirations of those countries we shall help them to the best of our abilities by providing them with assistance and shall share with them the experience we have acquired in the process of overcoming our inherited economic backwardness and in the course of our present dynamic development.78.	In Latin America  Asia and Africa many countries continue to be subjected to various forms of political and economic pressures devised to dissuade them from effecting progressive internal reforms and from pursuing independent foreign policies. Poland will  as it has been doing up till now  consistently favor the position that the legitimate rights of all countries and peoples of those continents should be respected.79.	We are also expanding our relations with the United States. The recent visit to Warsaw paid by Mr. Richard Nixon  the President of the United States  was an important development in Polish-American relations and no doubt has contributed to the expansion of our mutual relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.80.	Also  recently  we have noted that further progress is being made in various fields owing inter alia to the talks held several days ago between the representatives of the Governments of Poland and of the United States. Poland  a socialist State consolidating its alliances and common activities with the countries of the socialist community  wishes to expand its relations with the United States in the interests of strengthening peace and security and of developing co-operation between States having different socio-political systems.81.	The detente in international relations achieved during the recent period is an iron-clad This is first of all a great achievement by the Soviet Union and the entire socialist community through the program of peace adopted by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and consistently implemented by the Soviet political leadership. The detente in international relations is also an achievement by all those realistic forces in the world which have for years now been treating the concept of peaceful coexistence as the sole basis for the development of international relations ensuring peace and security.82.	It was with great satisfaction that Poland welcomed the fact that as a result of the talks between Leonid Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  and other Soviet leaders  and Mr. Richard Nixon  the President of the United States  the principles of peaceful coexistence were accepted as a basis for the relations between the two great Powers.83.	Poland also acclaims the agreements achieved on the question of the limitation of strategic nuclear armament's and hopes for the further and fruitful continuation of the talks on the limitation of strategic armaments and hopes for the further and fruitful continuation of the talks on the limitation of strategic armaments in order to make progress in the direction of the elimination of this most dangerous of weapons.84.	I wish to express our full support for the proposal put forth recently by Andrei Gromyko  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  on the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/8793].85.	We fully endorse the initiative to convene a world disarmament conference. At present there are proper conditions for the convening of such an authoritative forum and for ensuring that its debates would produce positive results.86.	The implementation of those initiatives would constitute another step towards the attainment of the fundamental goal of nations and of the United Nations  that is to say  the strengthening of security  the consolidation of peace and an expansion of international co-operation.87.	The principles of peaceful coexistence and equal co-operation among countries are indivisible and cannot be applied selectively only to certain countries or to certain regions alone.88.	The echoes of bombs being dropped on towns and villages in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  on South Viet-Nam and on other countries in IndoChina arouse condemnation and protest in Poland and serve to strengthen solidarity with the peoples of IndoChina  who are waging a heroic struggle for their freedom. Because of its membership in the International Supervisory Commission for IndoChina  Poland also demands that an end be put to the war in VietNam and favors a peaceful solution to the conflict in accordance with the proposals submitted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of VietNam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.89.	Highly alarming is the intransigence with which Israel continues to refuse to implement Security Council resolution 242(1967). We believe that the Arab territories occupied by Israel must be returned to their rightful owners. Only on such basis can the conflict in the Middle East be resolved and conditions created for the safe existence and development of all States and nations of that area.90.	In the course of recent years we have been witnessing increased terrorist activities in which innocent people lost their lives. I wish to emphasize that Poland condemns acts of violence and terror as they poison the international atmosphere and increase international tensions. We are in favor of effective steps to prevent such acts. However  the slogan of combating terrorism cannot be used to restrict the right of peoples to struggle against aggressors occupying their lands  nor can it be used to serve the policies of colonialism  racialism and discrimination. In condemning and combating terrorism we should be aware that the source and root cause of terrorism are the practices resorted to by invaders  colonialists and racists and it should be precisely the root-causes that we should seek to eliminate.91.	Poland attaches major importance to the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Problems relating to our participation in the work of the United Nations were discussed in the useful talks we had with the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  during his recent visit to Poland.92.	We feel that the United Nations should concentrate on the consolidation of peace and international security. The Organization should also continue to play an active and inspiring role in the development of international co-operation in economic and social matters. Our Organization can and should play an important role in making peaceful use of the achievements of the scientific and technological revolution. The war against hunger calls for intensified efforts by the United Nations. Our Organization can contribute to the goal of making rational use of the resources of the seas and oceans for the benefit of the whole of mankind. The problems of the use and exploitation of outer space require further regulation. And  last but not least  the need for the preservation and proper protection of the natural environment of man is ever more universally felt.93.	Such is the catalog  far from complete  of problems which in the near future will be absorbing the attention of our Organization.94.	Poland is deeply convinced that the United Nations meets all the conditions for coping with these tasks. This conviction stems from the evaluation of the past activities of the United Nations. The balance-sheet of the Organization's work is positive in principle. But this does not prevent us from seeing the shortcomings which we have observed on more than one occasion  and which we continue to observe  in the activities of the United Nations.95.	Poland  which has consistently defended the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter  wishes to emphasize once again that the path towards improving the activity of the United Nations lies  not in a revision of the Charter  but in a fuller utilization of the constructive possibilities provided by its provisions. One of the fundamental conditions is the implementation of the principle of the universality of our Organization.96.	It is also of essential importance to maintain administration within reasonable limits and to remedy the Organization's financial situation  in order to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations.97.	We believe that when these conditions are met-and also given the active role and assistance of the Secretary- General  who with great energy has begun discharging the tasks entrusted to him our Organization will not fail to live up to the hopes placed in it by mankind. Poland  as heretofore  is ready to contribute actively to resolving the important issues confronting the United Nations."
"94",5733,"PRT",27,1972,"Mr. President  the delegation of Portugal to the United Nations has always had the delegation of Poland as its neighbor on the left. The two delegations have always maintained mutual relations of peaceful coexistence and even of good neighborliness. In Europe  our countries are not neighbors. But the ancient history of both countries never separated Portugal and Poland in the veneration of our spiritual values  in the keen patriotism of our inhabitants and in their contribution to civilization. In like fashion nothing today separates the two nations in the aspiration  common to both  for a lasting peace and co-operation among all the peoples of our continent.2.	My delegation and I rejoice at seeing you elevated to the highest office of this General Assembly  and we most sincerely wish you  Sir  the greatest of personal success.3.	The task of the President of the General Assembly is not an easy one. The problems that arise are many and complex. They must be solved harmoniously  in strict observance of the Charter and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Thus  the President is called upon to display understanding tempered by prudence  flexibility matching firmness  and a spirit of conciliation that will not strain justice. Ample proof of these qualities was given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  Mr. Adam Malik  the President of the last session of the General Assembly. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey to Mr. Malik  on behalf of my delegation and personally  our warmest greetings. I would also express the hope that this session of the Assembly  under your guidance  Sir  will contribute to greater harmony among States and peoples  a harmony which can flow only from a spirit of justice  respect for truth  understanding and tolerance.4.	At this moment when the General Assembly is starting its work there is much to concern us. In the international political arena there is a clash of ideologies  ambitions  interests and anxieties. Up to a point this is normal  for life itself signifies movement and dynamism. But crises and conflicts multiply in the world  bringing disorder  insecurity and death. We regret these facts  but it seems that not all are agreed that there can be no peace or security without order  and that there can be no order without international norms which all must obey. No one  I believe  would attribute the existing world crises and conflicts to a lack of normative regulations of harmonious intercourse among nations  just as no one would attribute the state of affairs in this Organization to any deficiency in the principles enshrined in the Charter.5.	The United Nations was established with one specific and fundamental objective in view: to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security by preventing and repelling aggression through collective action. The provisions enunciating the purposes and fundamental principles on which this Organization rests reflect the keenest aspirations of mankind and the juridical norms without which those ideals cannot be achieved: the maintenance of international peace and security; the peaceful settlement of all conflicts; the sovereign equality of all Member States; the renunciation of the threat or use of force; noninterference in the internal affairs of States; non-recourse to war  aggression and violence. The most authoritative voices in the world have proclaimed this.6.	Today  27 years after the last world conflagration  mankind is able to look with a measure of relief on important initiatives seeking to lessen the causes of tension among the great Powers. But everything that has been achieved in this vital field  where the very survival of the human species is at stake  has taken place outside the United Nations  without the latter having in any fashion influenced the march of events.7.	We enthusiastically applaud the partial successes already achieved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  the Soviet-American and Chinese-American contacts  the German-Soviet treaty   the German-Polish treaty  and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin   as well as the progress achieved in the preparations for a conference on security and co-operation in Europe. But we would wish to see the spirit of conciliation and dialog that made that important progress possible prevail in this Organization also and make it possible to solve the crises and conflicts that still exist in the world today.8.	The realities of the balance of power politics have thrust the specter of a world war farther into the distance. But they have not prevented the continued eruption of localized conflicts or the more generalized use of violence in the most varied and novel forms.9.	Recent spectacular events have brought the matter of the use of violence to the general debate of this Assembly. Everything that has been said about violence focuses attention on three themes  which are at the center of all debates and controversies: violence and its legitimate causes; the primacy of the rule of law; and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.10.	The condemnation by the Charter of the United Nations of war and aggression is an absolute and all- embracing principle. It implies the primacy of peace over war  of negotiation over conflict  of dialog over confrontation. The definition on which  in a specific case  the qualification of a given party who has violated the principle and the rule of law etc. depends may be discussed indefinitely  but no one possessed of any common sense and of sound mind would be able to discuss in the abstract the primacy of peace over war. Except in cases of self-defense  individual or collective  all wars are unlawful; all wars are to be condemned; all wars are unjust. The new international order established at San Francisco sought to do away once and for all with practices and ideas which were supposed to have been definitely rendered obsolete.11.	War as a means or an instrument for the achievement of national and international objectives-whether these be territorial aggrandizement  economic expansion  the acquisition of living space  greater security for a State or group of States  the elimination of injustices in third States  the liberation of supposedly oppressed minorities or majorities  the supremacy of a race or religion  the advancement of an ideology or social system considered superior was condemned once and for all.12.	But that did not eliminate the causes  conditions  elements  objectives  doctrines and ideologies which in the past had provoked aggressions and armed conflicts  and which  moreover  had always been invoked by aggressors and warmongers to justify their actions. In the present-day world there persist almost everywhere  perhaps with even greater intensity  different ideologies  opposing systems  conflicts of interest  territorial claims  unjust situations  gross inequities in the level of development  discrimination and oppression  persecutions  violations of the rights of individuals and of groups. Which State in this Organization has not already been the object of an accusation  or been in opposition or in conflict with another State or group of States in any one of those areas? Which will be exempt from them in the future?13.	But no divergence of systems  no opposition of ideologies  no conflict of interest  no wish for justice or reform  no desire whether sincere or fictitious-for liberation can legitimize the use of force by one State or group of States against another State or group of States. Today  the world conscience does not accept this; nor does the Charter of our Organization permit it.14.	Nevertheless  the final and unconditional condemnation of war and aggression does not signify general passivity or the maintenance of the status quo in all areas. It may be said  however  that this condemnation marks a turning- point in history  which has given mankind a new confidence in itself and renewed faith in the possibility of achieving justice and progress through peaceful means. Contemporary man draws from the most profound meaning of the great currents of history lessons of a new philosophy of peace and non-violence which must inspire and impregnate the international order of today.15.	The great conquests of man were not the fruit of a victory at arms. Greek philosophy came to dominate the Roman conqueror. The law born in Rome came to be accepted by the invading barbarians. The Napoleonic Code and the principles of 1789 survived even after Waterloo. If such was the case in the past  today  in this second half of the twentieth century with the advance of science and technology ensuring as never before the circulation of ideas  communication between men and the opening up of all societies to mutual influences-can we entertain any doubts about the triumphant power of thought  the overwhelming contagion of freedom  the virtues of economic development and the expansion of culture in modifying the behavior of men and correcting social injustice?16.	But unorganized violence has succeeded the violence exercised by States  even though it is often fostered and directed by them. Under the guise of wars of liberation  of struggle against oppression  of fighting against imperialism and against capitalism  once again attempts are made to give a semblance of legitimacy to violence and aggression. It is significant that in a debate on the question of terrorism the voices raised in an attempt to legitimize the use of violence as an instrument of the alleged justice of the causes invoked resurrected obsolete doctrines of a ""just war"".17.	In an intervention of the purest medieval flavor  the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics spoke of terrorists who subsequently become heroes. He thereby wished to conclude that the international order must accept and support terrorism in certain cases that is to say  only in those cases which serve the interests and designs of the Soviet Union. Has the representative of the Soviet Union also thought of the heroes of Prague and Budapest  and the statues which one day will commemorate in those capitals a just and legitimate struggle against a foreign oppressor? Will not the same reasoning lead him to find in the historical evocation of the heroic warriors of Holy Russia arguments to impart legitimacy to the use of force in the service of the objectives of modern Soviet imperialism?18.	The condemnation  prevention and repression of violence and terrorism must be general and unconditional if they are to become rules of law. They cannot become enmeshed in the doctrinal and ideological disputes that divide States. If the international community really intends to free humanity from the scourge of terrorism and violence  it cannot accept these loose distinctions between just and unjust terrorism  legal and illegal terrorism  between terrorism that has been recognized by the Organization of African Unity and terrorism that has received no recognition.19.	Which shall be the good terrorists and which the bad? Those whom a precarious and temporary majority in this General Assembly regard as such at a given moment? And if at the following session  or a few years later  the alignment of combinations of interest and votes in this Assembly were to change  would not then the bad terrorists be hailed as heroes and the good ones regarded as criminals? What guarantees can the adoption of such a doctrine offer the international community? What judge in any country of Europe  Asia  the Middle East or America could condemn a terrorist with a clear conscience if the qualification of an act of terrorism is to depend on the opinion of the majority of this Assembly at a given moment?20.	The weeding out of violence and terrorism must be based on the supremacy of the rule of law. But this law  in order to be valid  must be general. The principle of the universality of law is a fundamental achievement of civilization  and a basic legacy of the culture of the peoples of the world. It is a principle that is essential to social life  both national and international. But it is a cold principle. It is not compatible with emotional appeals to crusades and holy wars  with confraternities of continent-wide or race- wide armed blocs  or with resolutions approved in Rabat  Addis Ababa or Dar-es-Salaam.21.	Discrimination in the application of law  domestic or international  is an odious and revolting practice. It destroys all the moral and juridical foundation of the law  deprives it of all validity  and incites its violation  giving legitimacy to such violation.22.	Portugal has been one of the victims of such discrimination. Principles deemed valid in certain cases are denied in Portugal's case. Rules applied to other countries are cast aside with contempt where Portugal is concerned. But the violation of this principle is infinitely dangerous for all. No one knows who will be tomorrow's victim. Man's memory is short  but that of history is inflexible and inexorable.23.	When  11 years ago  a merchant ship was the victim of an act of piracy in the mid-Atlantic  an act that took the lives of peaceful members of its crew  there was no reaction on the part of the international community  and many viewed that crime with sympathy  simply because the victims were Portuguese.24.	Thus was the door opened to aerial piracy. Those who today are inclined to consider anti-Portuguese terrorism as legitimate may perhaps tomorrow have to employ from this rostrum the same dramatic eloquence with which  at the current session  acts of aerial piracy were denounced in order to defend rules designed to protect the lives of nationals of their own countries attacked by the liberation movements which the majority of United Nations Members then considered legitimate.25.	But no rule has been the object of such flagrant discrimination in its application as the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States Members of the United Nations.26.	The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is enshrined in the political Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and has guided our policies in the most diverse situations. It would not be too much to ask other States which upon joining this Organization solemnly undertook to comply with the provisions of the Charter to apply to our country this same principle  the spirit of which is enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter  which speaks of practicing tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors. We sincerely and deeply regret that in Zambia President Kaunda should maintain a fierce tribal discrimination  perhaps the worst kind of ethnic discrimination.27.	We are very much concerned with the fate of the Bembas and the Lumpas. We also hope that the economic policies of President Kaunda will not prevent the Zambians from acceding rapidly to the fruits of economic advancement. We firmly hope too that the majority of Zambians will come to enjoy in the future the self-determination to which they have an indisputable right and of which they have been unjustly deprived.28.	However  despite these feelings  we have not arrogated unto ourselves the right of intervening in the internal affairs of that country. Neither have we sheltered  instigated or supported terrorists acting against it  nor have we proclaimed the inevitability of war against that African country. We scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all our neighbors. But we consider that this attitude must be reciprocal.29.	For the last 11 years Portugal has been the victim of armed attacks unleashed by groups  organized  commanded  armed and based on foreign territory. The action of these groups  which indiscriminately attack the civilian populations and the authorities of our African Territories constitutes illegal terrorist activity. The support given to them from abroad  without which their actions would be impossible and would have ceased long ago  represents a flagrant violation of international law and of the principles and rules of the United Nations Charter.30.	Notwithstanding this situation Portugal has displayed extreme moderation and a spirit of conciliation  by refraining from any retaliatory action  and renouncing the exercise of the right of self-defense  which would afford it the possibility of destroying the bases from which these armed attacks are launched. Portugal has acted in this manner because of its scrupulous respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the neighboring countries  and because it has not yet lost the hope that those countries will recognize the illegitimacy of their conduct and will come 10 accept the fundamental rules of peaceful coexistence. How many Member States in identical circumstances  and for such a long time  would have acted in this fashion? I wonder.\31.	It is true that several times we have been accused of violating the borders of neighboring States  of attacking their territory  of threatening their security. But if those accusations were true  why should an impartial investigation of the facts always have been rejected  as has been the case in every specific instance?32.	If the authors of those accusations were not themselves convinced  as they are  of the complete lack of foundation of these charges why should they reject the setting up of border control commissions  which we have proposed  and which we again propose from this rostrum? If the African States  our neighbors  were not certain  as they are  that we do not represent any threat to their sovereignty and 'territorial integrity  why should they reject all the guarantees they have been offered and that we are ready to give them? Why should they refuse any and all conversations  negotiations or dialogs with us in this respect  while we have many times declared  and repeat today  that we are ready to' talk with them without any prior conditions? From those facts only one conclusion can be drawn: in all this business of the relations between Portugal and the African States bordering on our territories  and of peace and security in Africa  good faith and the Charter of the United Nations are solely and exclusively on the side of Portugal.33.	Attempts have been made to justify and legitimize support for the terrorist movements operating in the Portuguese Territories on the strength of the argument that they represent the majority of the respective populations and are struggling against colonial oppression and against an authority in illegal occupation of their territory. But the fact that small minorities practice revolutionary armed action and terrorism all over the world today is forgotten. Armed action is not enough to give legitimacy to a movement as representing a population  even if a majority of States hostile to the country which is the victim of the attacks so claims. A subversive movement cannot be representative of a population when it operates solely in frontier areas and under cover of safe support from foreign countries. Their total and growing dependence on foreign support takes away all representative character from the anti-Portuguese terrorist movements  which  moreover  are opposed by the overwhelming majority of the population of their respective territories.34.	We are now being accused of making use of our African nationals in the defense of their lands. We accept this accusation. It is true. Over 50 per cent of all the forces defending the Portuguese Territories are African troops. And these numbers will constantly grow. What a strange accusation! Is it a crime for the inhabitants of a territory to take up arms in order to defend themselves against attacks launched against them from foreign soil? Is it a crime for a Government to furnish them with the means of protecting themselves from being massacred? And tomorrow> when in Portuguese Guinea all those defending the Portuguese cause turn out to be Africans and the Communist brigades attacking them are all made up of Cubans and other international bandits  will it still be said that this is a liberation movement and that the former is an army of occupation?35.	In order to try to justify the illegal support given to the subversive anti-Portuguese movements  it was necessary to invent the myth of the ""liberated areas"". The so-called liberation movements supposedly have under their control extensive zones in the Portuguese territories which supposedly constitute ""liberated areas"" and which they are supposedly administering. But if these movements  as we sometimes hear in this Organization  control two thirds of Portuguese Guinea  one third of Angola and one fifth of Mozambique  how can the Portuguese armed forces constitute a threat to peace and to the territorial integrity of the neighboring States? And why do these subversive movements find it necessary to maintain their bases and headquarters on foreign territory? Why do they fear frontier control and the respect of borders as dangerous to their activities? But here is a subject where arguments of logic are less valid than facts. An authority's control over a territory is proved by the fact of its control. And this is verified by direct observation. As the Portuguese Government knows that there is no ""liberated area"" in its overseas provinces  that there is no part of any of these territories where its authority is not legitimately constituted and exercised  or where its representatives are prevented from going wherever they want  it has addressed a formal invitation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to send a mission to verify  on the spot and whenever it wishes  the effective exercise of Portuguese sovereignty.36.	Since this was an important matter of fact  one which some Members of this Organization viewed as controversial  it would have been normal for that invitation to be accepted. But no  it was declined. The United Nations is not interested in verifying the existence of the alleged liberated areas. Indeed  fictitious liberated areas and imaginary sovereignties can only be verified by invisible missions!37.	Time does not permit me to dwell at length on this subject. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal has published and distributed in this Organization a detailed brochure which clarifies this important matter. And if I use this rostrum to publicize this publication  it is because in this field also we are the victims of total and unjust discrimination. The United Nations Office of Public Information  in violation of the principle of equal rights for all Member States and of equity itself  is being used as an instrument of extensive and fierce anti-Portuguese propaganda. This is how this Organization's funds are spent!38.	Portugal  with its whole national territory as defined in the Portuguese political Constitution  was admitted to the United Nations as a Member State in 1955. Having admitted Portugal to membership  the United Nations recognized the territorial composition of the Portuguese State  as well as the constitutional statute of all its integral parts. And under Article 2 of the Charter  all Member States have the obligation to respect this composition. The fact that some countries do not consider our overseas territories as integral parts of Portugal and that they claim that they fall under Article 73 of the Charter does not give them the right either to seek to overturn by violent means the prevailing situation in Africa  or to become the instruments for the performance of acts contrary to international law and to the Charter itself.39.	Notwithstanding these indisputable legal facts  an astonishing event took place in the United Nations a few days ago. At a meeting of one of the Committees of thisAssembly  it was resolved to admit one does not know with what status  in what conditions and with what objective the presence of individuals who acknowledge themselves to be leaders of terrorist movements operating against Portuguese African Territories. A prior proposal by some delegations to request a legal opinion from the Secretariat was rejected by the majority. In this fashion  it was admitted and acknowledged that the United Nations is an Organization without law and without regulations  that law no longer counts.40.	The existence and the credibility of the United Nations itself is at issue in such proceedings. The fundamental reasons for its existence  its most basic principles and its most essential purposes are at stake. I do not want to indulge in rhetoric or assume an excessively dramatic tone but I will say that to destroy the Portuguese nation it would be necessary to begin by destroying international law and the very structure of international society. The Portuguese nation  thanks to the courageous resistance put up by its people  has not been destroyed. But the same does not happen to be the case with the rules of international law  which are constantly being eroded as a consequence of the arbitrary process followed in this Organization in dealing with the Portuguese case.41.	Portugal refuses to accept that foreign countries or an international organization at the service of an inadmissible ideological imperialism should intervene in its internal affairs or presume to determine its future.42.	But  contrary to what has been widely said  Portugal does not reject the principle of self-determination. To reject the principle of self-determination would be tantamount to denying the essential dignity of man. As long ago as 1963  in conversations with representatives of African States  under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  we tried to explain how we interpreted self-determination. And the Secretary-General  in his report to the Security Council on these talks  said that Portugal did not deny the principle of self-determination.43.	The conclusion to be drawn from the manner in which the anti-Portuguese campaign has been conducted in the United Nations is that it is sought not to secure self-determination for the populations of the Portuguese overseas provinces of Africa  but to impose on Portugal  under the pretext of self-determination  a policy which is the equivalent of having the matter determined by foreigners. It would not be a question of our populations freely exercising their choice. Rather  it would be a question of forcing our populations to accept a choice imposed by outsiders or at least of creating conditions which would leave those populations no alternative but that. The doctrine is similar to the one formulated by the Indian Prime Minister Mr. Nehru  who  on 6 September 1955  told the Upper House of the Indian Parliament that the Portuguese must leave Goa  even if the Goans wish them to remain. This  too  is self-determination in the view of some Members of the United Nations.44.	As far as Portugal is concerned  the right to self-determination is the prerogative of all men and of all societies. But it is a right that must be exercised without any outside interference even of the United Nations and through the means best suited to each case.45.	Portugal is proud of the creation of the great Brazilian nation and participated in a privileged and fraternal position in the ceremonies marking the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence.46.	But Portugal has never brought into existence  nor will it ever bring into existence  white independence or black independence. The unity of the Portuguese nation is the mainstay and the guarantee of the multiracial society which we have built up in Africa. Unless it is integrated in the Portuguese nation  that multiracial society would obviously disappear. And could it be that this very result is the objective of the opponents of Portuguese policies?47.	Contrary to what is so often said  Portugal is not opposed to decolonization. We view with sympathy the efforts of the Governments of young independent African States to consolidate their nations a task that encompasses the struggle against underdevelopment  against foreign economic domination and against the outbreak of tribal rivalries  while at the same time ensuring the genuine political and economic integration of the great mass of their populations in accordance with the objectives and living standard desired by the elites which at present are governing these States. The Portuguese are engaged in similar tasks. We devote to these tasks our experience  our vast geographical horizons and our ethnically and culturally richly varied human elements. In the face of the decolonization movement  Portugal can well consider itself rich in possibilities and prospects.48.	The objectives and the realities of Portuguese policies in Africa compel us to reject as unfounded the criticism leveled against us in this Organization. The overseas provinces of Portugal are not and have never been dependencies of the European part of Portugal. The system of legal  political  social and ethnic values is the same throughout the Portuguese territory. That is why we find it difficult to understand that this system should be labeled as colonial  since the colonial system is essentially a system of dependency  subordination and economic exploitation of one territory for the benefit of another  under the same sovereignty. There is nothing like that in the Portuguese system. Therefore  it is not surprising that we reject the label of colonialists  because our system is  and has always been  different.49.	As I said  we have our system of values. We are ready to explain it and to discuss it. There will certainly be some points which will be accepted by our critics. For example  contrary to what was happening 10 years ago obviously through lack of information today nobody questions the sincerity of our multi-racialism or  rather  the racial equality which we practice.50.	In view of the interest of certain delegations which follow the matter closely  I should like to say a few words about the most recent developments concerning our overseas provinces. I am not unaware of the fact that the events which stir the greatest interest are those of a political nature.51.	Portuguese policies have not remained static  as is sometimes erroneously believed  perhaps because they move along the lines of the orientation of the Portuguese system  which  I repeat  is based on national unity. Within this system  the Portuguese Constitution was revised last year. Many changes were brought about  the most important ones relating to our overseas provinces. The purpose of the constitutional revision was essentially to give effect to the Portuguese Government's orientation towards progressive autonomy for the overseas provinces.52.	The principles enunciated in the Constitution concerning the policy and administration of the overseas territories  in keeping with a policy of decentralization  are the following:(a)	The existence of special statutes for the provinces as autonomous regions;(b)	The designation of ""State""  when the advancement of the social milieu and the complexity of its administration justifies such a classification (this designation has already been granted to Angola and Mozambique while the Portuguese State of India always had it);(c)	Their own political and administrative organization adapted to their geographical situation and state of development.53.	The autonomy of each overseas province is set out in the following manner: the existence of elective governing bodies; the right to legislate; the right to ensure  through its own governing bodies  the implementation of laws and the carrying out of internal administration; financial autonomy consisting of the right to approve the provincial budget; the right to have a specific economic system appropriate to the needs of development and the well-being of the population.54.	As far as the bodies exercising provincial powers are concerned  while the Governor is appointed by the central Government  the others  that is the legislative assemblies  must necessarily be elected locally. It is the central Government's duty to watch over the general interests of the overseas Territories  to ensure their international representation and their defense and to legislate on matters of common interest. The central Government also supervises their fiscal administration and management and protects the population against threats or attempts against their individual or collective rights. This last constitutional provision is of the utmost importance and reflects a basic idea expressed by our Prime Minister  Marcello Caetano:""If any segregationist tendencies sKould manifest themselves locally  they will be inexorably combated by the intervention of the central Government  should this provenecessary. We shall not give up our intention to persevere in the building of multiracial societies and we shall not compromise as regards the maintenance of a single statute for all Portuguese  whatever their race or color.""55.	Thus the Constitution permits an ample  effective autonomy in the provinces. The intention of the Portuguese Government is progressively to promote the enlargement of this autonomy while ensuring at the same time the participation of the entire population of each of the provinces in self-government. In keeping with this orientation a new organic law for the overseas Territories  common to all the provinces  was promulgated this year  and the approval of new statutes for each province will soon be undertaken. The provincial legislative assemblies will be made up of elected members. Their composition and the mode of election of their members will guarantee adequate representation for all citizens. The powers of the legislative assemblies  at the provincial level  will to a certain extent parallel the powers of the central Parliament at the national level.56.	The organic law opens up new opportunities for the local elites  enhances the importance of the provincial legislative organs and creates institutional cadres which go far to meet the deep aspirations of the people in keeping with the realities of the progress and political maturity of these populations. We shall pursue without faltering our policies of economic development and social progress  so that all the inhabitants of the overseas provinces may acquire the moral and technical qualifications needed for the discharge of political functions. It has been stated in these halls—I do not know on what basis-that each school we build is ""a crime against humanity"". If that is so  I confess that we have committed thousands of ""crimes"" of that kind  and we shall continue relentlessly to commit many more  for we assign the greatest importance to the spread of education at all levels  seeking to take it to the most remote populations. Since 1960 we have more than doubled school attendance in all the overseas provinces.57.	Anyone visiting our overseas provinces will be able to observe new works in progress in the field of infrastructures  communications  electric power  industry and agriculture. I shall mention here only the colossal enterprises of Cunene and Cabora Bassa  which  according to some  are two other ""crimes against humanity"" which we are committing. I remember in this connexion that a few years ago we were being accused of not promoting the economic development of our overseas provinces. Today this development generally surpasses the levels achieved in other parts of the African continent. But since our efforts cannot be denied  anti-Portuguese propaganda has had to change its tune  which shows that no matter what we do we shall always be the object of some criticism. It is important to emphasize that our efforts at economic and social development are being made without any external assistance  a fact that renders even more significant our levels of development and their comparison with those other Territories. In truth Portugal can legitimately consider itself to be the only country in the world with Territories in the process of development which is receiving ""negative aid"" from the international community.58.	I should like nothing more than to dwell at length on the fascinating subject of the economic and social development taking place in our overseas provinces   but time presses and I must end.59.	In order to justify the support of violence and terrorism in our African territories it is alleged that Portugal refuses to enter into a dialog and that it practices repression in its overseas Territories.60.	Our defense activities will cease the moment aggression from abroad ceases. Not long ago the Portuguese Government made a solemn appeal  followed by broad and concrete measures of clemency  to all Portuguese Africans who had allowed themselves to be enticed by subversive movements to return to peaceful life and 1.0 collaborate in the progress and the development of their Territories.61.	Even though we have already done so in the past  I hereby renew our invitations to African countries to send their representatives to visit our overseas provinces where they will get all the information they want about living conditions in those Territories. We are ready to start a dialog with them concerning our concepts  our realities and our plans.62.	We have also expressed our readiness to conclude with the African countries non-aggression pacts and agreements for the peaceful solution of any existing bilateral problems. I again renew that offer.63.	Similarly  I renew our offer to our neighboring countries to set up  by mutual agreement  joint border control commissions.64.	I also renew the invitation addressed to the Secretariat of the United Nations  in the terms and conditions already communicated to them  to send qualified observers to Portuguese Guinea so that in the light of day and in comfort and safety they may verify in all parts of the Territory they might wish to visit who it is that exercises effectively the powers of administration. At this time I extend the same invitation for visits to the States of Angola and Mozambique.65.	The preparatory work for a European conference on security and co-operation will begin shortly. If such a conference is considered possible and desirable in Europe  where there are different political  economic and social systems  why could not the same principles as are at the basis of that conference apply to Africa? Could there be any interest in fostering conflicts in Africa so that the continent might fall prey more easily to economic and ideological neo-colonialism?66.	We offer to all African countries our entire co-operation and collaboration in the great tasks whose implementation in Africa and in other continents should be of interest to the United Nations in this decade of the 1970s: peace  economic development  social advancement  the elimination of all forms of discrimination and unjust inequalities among men. All the resources of our Territories will be available for collaborating towards these ends."
"95",5780,"PRY",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I convey to' you my sincerest congratulations on your election to preside over the deliberations of the ""current session of the General Assembly. In expressing to you our best wishes for success in the difficult task that has been entrusted to you by the unanimous decision of the Members of the United Nations  I should point out that in the brief period that has elapsed since you assumed the presidency you have already given us ample evidence to confirm the wisdom of your election. Once again my delegation wishes to offer you its fullest co-operation.2.	As this is the first general debate that has been held since Mr. Kurt Waldheim was appointed Secretary-General of the United Nations and began to discharge his duties  my Government has expressly instructed me to confirm its full confidence and faith in the activities of the new Secretary- General  whose outstanding personal qualities of talent  wisdom  devotion to the cause of peace and justice  and deep-rooted knowledge of the problems of our era and of our Organization are a guarantee that through the years of his term of office he will guide the United Nations successfully to the achievement of the purposes and principles for which it was established.3.	Once again my delegation comes to the General Assembly to express its wishes  its concerns  its hopes and disappointments. However  as we are well aware that the allocation of work to the various main Committees will permit of a full and detailed discussion of the items on the General Assembly's agenda in those bodies  my delegation will confine itself here today to making only a few comments on some of those items  especially those in connexion with which we should like to make our position abundantly clear.4.	I should be derelict in the discharge of a fundamental duty  however  if I did not precede these comments with at least a brief review of the characteristic features of the current international situation.5.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has given us his views on the international situation:""Over the past year three main trends two of them encouraging  one discouraging have been apparent on the international scene. The first is the process of detente among the great Powers. The second and discouraging one is the persistence of conflict in several key areas of the world and the failure  both of the Governments concerned and of the international community  to find acceptable solutions to the underlying problems involved. The third trend is the series of efforts by the international community to co-operate in tackling  through the United Nations system  some of the great long-term problems of our planet  such as trade and development  the environment and population."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. l.]6.	We are sincerely gratified to observe the relaxation of tensions between the great Powers and the consequent gradual improvement in their relations-all of which has led to an appreciable positive change in conditions. We know full well that for far too long a period of time the winds of the cold war raged all too forcefully  undermining or completely nullifying opportunities for constructive  fruitful common action. The impact of the new situation  which we witness with such satisfaction  is already obvious  even in regions of the earth geographically far removed one from the other  such as Eastern and Western Europe and the Korean peninsula. But the lessening of tensions does not mean that they have disappeared or that they have been completely eliminated  although we trust that a better day is about to dawn.A/PV.20627.	We must of necessity be cautious in our optimism. Indeed  we have good reason not to let our hopes fly too high. There have been agreements on the limitation of armaments  the importance of which we cannot and should not underestimate  but the possibilities for general and complete disarmament under effective international control the ambitious goal of a decade-are still remote  and the sums spent by a few powerful States on increasingly complicated and costly armaments remain at such a high level compared with the volume of international financial aid provided by the developed countries to the developing nations that they immediately bring to mind the living conditions of most of the earth's population  which has thus far been frustrated in its desire to break down the artificially erected barriers which bar the way to a better life  to higher standards of living and a more equitable distribution of the fruits of its labor. 8.	The efforts of the parties themselves and those of the international community have still proved unsuccessful in solving the conflicts in various key areas of the world  to which reference has been made by the Secretary-General. I am thinking of the Middle East and of Viet-Nam. In the Middle East  in view of the precarious present situation  a conflagration may erupt again the devastating flames of which not only would engulf the States located in the area but would also spread and intensify. I am thinking of Viet-Nam where a bloody  grim and destructive war is being waged such as we have seldom seen before. I am thinking of colonialism which  although dying out  has not completely disappeared and is still preventing many peoples from exercising their legitimate right to be the masters of their own destiny and to govern themselves. I must point out that the terrible scourge of racial discrimination still persists in some areas of the world.9.	My delegation has repeatedly stated its position on all these questions and I need not do so again. But I should like once again to express our hopes that in the not too distant future we shall witness the dawn of peace  of prosperity and justice for the States in areas now beset by armed conflicts and for the peoples of areas where the unrestricted implementation of the right of self-determination is not yet at hand.10.	At the beginning of my statement I said that my delegation  once again  wished to give voice to its hopes and its frustrations. The latter is an apt term by which to describe the tremendous and growing gap between the two parts in which the world of today is divided  viewed from the standpoint of their degree of development  levels of living and sharing of wealth. On more than one occasion we have said that under the prevailing conditions of international trade  with raw material prices at a standstill or declining and the costs of manufactured goods steadily rising  in the words of the Foreign Minister of Paraguay:""The breach between over-developed and underdeveloped countries widens all the time and  although political colonialism may have ended  economic colonialism exercised over the agricultural countries will continue unless there is a substantial change in the present conditions of production and export of agricultural commodities.""11.	I should also remind the Assembly  as I have already done on previous occasions  of a known fact which none the less should be repeated because it influences many of the positions we take. My country is not only a member of the large group called the developing countries  but at the same time it is one of those which realizes that in addition to the problems of development without adequate national capacity for financing and without sufficient international financial aid  which are serious enough in themselves  we are also faced with problems which derive from the fact that we are a land-locked  inland country far removed from the sea and from all the benefits which possession of a coastline brings with it. This fact explains our firm determination and our constant fight in all forums and in all organs to obtain endorsement of the principles of an increasingly enlightened international law which  through international justice  compensates for the obvious disadvantages deriving from a land-locked position. To quote only one example among the many that I could mention  we should bear in mind that  in order to export goods which are the source of our income  and to enable them to compete successfully in foreign markets  land-locked States are compelled to reduce further the already low sales prices or somehow to absorb the higher transport and freight costs for goods shipped to the sea ports. Only thus can these goods compete on an equal footing with those from more fortunate countries that have the benefit of a coastline.12.	These remarks apply not only to questions concerning world trade but they also have an impact on matters included in the scheduled Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the reservation exclusively for peaceful purposes of the sea-bed and the ocean floor  and the subsoil thereof  underlying the high seas beyond the limits of present national jurisdiction and the use of their resources in the interests of mankind.13.	I note the fact  which can easily be verified  that since the outset of the consideration of these questions in 1967 on the use of the aforesaid resources  one point has been very much in the forefront of our debates. This is the question of the extent or breadth of the territorial sea and the extent or breadth of the contiguous zone; and this area is increasingly being described as the patrimonial sea. The importance of this issue has been much more obvious in the current general debate  in the course of which very well qualified representatives of the riparian States have referred to the question in depth. I cannot forget that in these statements and with reference to the exploitation of the resources of the contiguous zone of the territorial sea  the speakers have emphasized that these resources should be used exclusively—I repeat  ""exclusively"" for the benefit of the coastal States.14.	At the meeting held on 17 April 1971 at San José  Costa Rica  during the first regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country Professor Raul Sapena Pastor  referred to the question of the breadth of the territorial sea in order to make the following points on behalf of Paraguay:""The Republic of Paraguay is an inland land-locked country  and geographical and historical circumstances have deprived it of the extraordinary benefit of having a coastline. Nonetheless  Paraguay has the right to enjoy freedom of the high seas and unlimited navigation and to have access to fisheries  the underlying resources and the airspace over the sea. To the extent that the States with coastlines arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by widening their territorial sea  they are also arbitrarily limiting the rights of the Republic of Paraguay and of all inland or land-locked States.""He went on to say:""The breadth of the territorial sea can be fixed not by national precepts  whether they are derived from law or the Constitution  but through the consent of all States  including those that are land-locked and those that have coastlines  a consent expressed in the form of international agreements.""15.	The foregoing ideas apply equally to the contiguous zone. The sovereignty of nations over what is described as the territorial sea is an unquestioned concept of international law; but there is no generally accepted agreement on its breadth which  depending .upon the coastal State concerned  extends from 3 to 200 miles. While there may have been a time when the individual will of each riparian State could be exercised in establishing V breadth of its territorial sea  we cannot today condone u system which produces a variety of views derived from unilateral decisions or proclamations. With respect to the breadth of the so-called patrimonial sea  the existence of different criteria is even less warranted.16.	None the less  we have been asked more than once to support the aspirations of States which wish to extend considerably their territorial as well as their so-called patrimonial sea  or the zone contiguous to the territorial sea. But we have already said that any extension of this kind automatically reduces the rights of the land-locked States. Therefore  there is an obvious contradiction in such requests  when they are made with no mention of any form of compensation. Certainly today's world is growing ever more interdependent; and certainly States-particularly those that belong to the developing world-need each other and are in duty bound to express mutual solidarity to each other in order to strengthen the defence of their common interests. But solidarity implies a certain amount of give and take. It cannot take the form of support by some States for the aspirations of others without corresponding concessions. Yet this is precisely the kind of one-sided situation which exists between the riparian States and the land-locked or inland States. Has the time not yet come  we wonder  to focus on these problems with a more decisive and enlightened sense of solidarity? This is the question that we are not called upon to answer alone.17.	Turning to another group of matters  I would touch on the fact that the General Assembly is preparing to consider actions that might be taken as a result of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Among the decisions which sooner or later will have to be taken are the recommendations for the establishment of an administering board  a secretariat  a fund and co-ordination procedures for programs dealing with the environment  within the framework of the United Nations. In addition  the Conference adopted the text of a declaration  on its Principle 20  which was to refer this to the General Assembly for consideration  together with the proposed amendments submitted in the course of the Stockholm Conference.18.	Owing to the fact that for various reasons my country was not represented at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  I feel it necessary to explain our position on Principle 20  which was the subject of many amendments. We are particularly interested in this Principle inasmuch as it affects international rivers.19.	Our position is defined in the text of the Declaration of Asuncion on the exploitation of international rivers  registered as resolution No. 25 of the Fourth Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Plata basin  adopted on 3 June 1971 in the capital of Paraguay. As this Declaration has already been quoted in this general debate  I think it my duty to quote verbatim the substantive section of that document:""The Foreign Ministers consider it to be of real interest to record the fundamental points on which agreement has already been reached and which represent the basis on which study of this item should continue:cl. In contiguous international rivers  since sovereignty is shared  any exploitation of these waters should be preceded by a bilateral agreement between the riparian States.""2. In international rivers which flow into each other  since sovereignty is not shared  each State can exploit the waters in terms of its needs  always provided that it does not cause any considerable damage to any other State of the Plata basin.""3. With respect to the exchange of hydrological and meteorological data:""(a) Those already provided will be the subject of dissemination and systematic publication through documents and pamphlets;""(b) Data to be processed  either simple observations and readings or graphic registers of instruments  will be conveyed or submitted in accordance with the judgment of the parties concerned.""4. States shall in so far as possible attempt to exchange gradually the cartographic or hydrographic results of their studies in the Plata basin in order to facilitate the defining of the dynamic system of the basin.""5. States will try as far as possible to maintain in the best possible navigation conditions the courses of the rivers under their sovereignty  adopting to this end the necessary means in order that the works will be carried out so as not to be prejudicial to any other current users of the river system.""6. States  in carrying out public works designed for any purpose in the rivers of the basin  shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that they do not damage or change in any prejudicial way the conditions for navigation.""7. States  in the carrying out of public works in the river system involving navigation  will adopt any measures necessary to preserve the living resources of the basin."" 20. My country considers that this Declaration implies very clearly inter alia the lack of entitlement of any State in the basin to divert the waters from one geographic region to another basin or sub-basin.21. I should like now to refer to agenda item 89 entitled ""Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations: report of the Secretary- General"". Two years ago I had an opportunity to state from this rostrum [1855th meeting] that my delegation did not believe that the time was then ripe to take up such a task  but I added that at the same time we considered that the item included in the agenda was an adequate instrument for proceeding to a real and effective evaluation of the predominant thinking among the Members of the United Nations concerning any possible review of the Charter. In the time that has elapsed since then a considerable number of States have been able to make known their views on the possible revision of the fundamental document of the United Nations. Some have done so through notes in answer to the questionnaire submitted by the Secretary- General. Others have done so in the course of statements made by their representatives at this session. We believe that the ideas suggested deserve most careful consideration. I am thinking in particular of the suggestions and proposals which refer to the composition and structure of the Security Council  and among these I should like to mention as an interesting example that which was put forward by the Foreign Minister of Mexico in the statement he made at the 2050th meeting of the General Assembly on 3 October last  to the effect that at least one permanent member of the Security Council should be a representative of the third world and should be on the same footing as the present permanent members. Certainly such an idea  as well as many other important ideas  has aroused understandable interest on the part of my delegation  and we shall examine these ideas  attributing to them all due importance.22. I have reserved the last part of my statement for my comments on that scourge which has considerably worsened in recent times  and I refer to international terrorism. This terrorism  which with painful frequency makes victims of the innocent and is characterized by cruelty and absolute contempt for legal rules established to maintain harmony and for the common good  creates a general climate of insecurity and collective fear  breaking down faith in the effectiveness of law and order  and may even lead to a crisis in the rule of law.23. Without ignoring the fact that in certain cases terrorism may be a reflection of underlying situations whose correction is essential and urgent  my country does not hesitate to condemn acts of international terrorism and considers that the time has come to proceed to joint action to eliminate this evil. First of all  we believe that every State should adopt measures  in the full exercise of its sovereignty  to prevent and punish this type of crime. Secondly  States  acting jointly  should seek ways and means to make certain co-ordinated and effective action to remove international terrorism from the face of the earth. For this action  for this search  there is no forum more suitable than the United Nations. On the basis of this conviction  we have been gratified to note the initiative taken by the Secretary-General in requesting the inclusion of this item in our agenda  and therefore we have supported this idea both in the General Committee and in the plenary General Assembly."
"96",5844,"QAT",27,1972,"197.  It gives me great pleasure to extend to the President my warm congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. I hope that this session of the General Assembly over which he presides will be able  with more vigor and tenacity  to achieve the noble principles proclaimed by the Charter.198.	I have pleasure also  in my capacity as the first Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar  to address the representatives of the world community for the first time since the independence of my country  which has enabled us to adopt a policy of domestic reform and to establish foreign relations in the hope that Qatar would take its rightful place in the world community in order to pursue constructive social progress  economic advancement and fruitful co-operation with other nations for the mutual benefit and welfare of all mankind.199.	Before my country joined this Organization last year  it was associated to it by its belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter and by the practical contribution it was making to its field of work. My country follows with great interest the activities of the United Nations in all fields  particularly those fields of work of concern to the specialized agencies related to it.200.	Our belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations was forcefully expressed by H.R.H. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani  Emir of the State of Qatar  on the eve of our independence  when he said:""The State accepts the obligations contained in the Charter of the United Nations  and believes in the purposes and principles of the Charter  which advocates the right of peoples to self-determination  international co-operation for the welfare of mankind  the prevalence of peace and security all over the world  and the obligation of nations to solve their differences by peaceful means and to establish relations between themselves on the principles of justice and equality according to the principles of international law.""201.	The State of Qatar joined the United Nations in the hope that the United Nations would concert its efforts in order to fulfill the purposes and principles of its Charter. But a number of this Organization's resolutions have never been implemented. There was an armed aggression against Arab countries  Members of this Organization  launched by Israel in 1967  during which Israel occupied by sheer force Arab lands. Despite the several United Nations resolutions condemning Israel  Israel still refuses to implement those resolutions and refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Israel also frustrated the mission of Mr. Gunnar Jarring  the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General; but in spite of all that  the United Nations did not take any action in fulfillment of the Articles of the Charter to repel the aggression.202.	That is not all. The hand of Israel reached to the Holy Places for the purpose of destroying and altering holy Jerusalem. Then occurred the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque  which led the Security Council in its resolution 271 (1969) to condemn Israel strongly for the measures it was adopting to change the status of Jerusalem.203.	We all know that the United Nations has recognized the established and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and proclaimed that full respect of these rights was essential for the establishment and prevalence of a permanent and just peace in the area. But Israel  which was responsible for the displacement of the Palestinian people from their homes  is still pursuing its expansionist policy and uses all methods to oppress the people of Palestine. The resolutions of the United Nations regarding the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are disregarded and blocked  a matter which  to our regret  creates doubts about the effectiveness of this Organization as an instrument for maintaining peace.204.	We therefore strongly advocate and insist that the United Nations see to it that its resolutions are implemented according to the Charter; hence it should force Israel to withdraw from aL the Arab territories which it occupied in 1967 and restore all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people so that the United Nations can work with dignity as an effective instrument for the preservation of peace.205.	My country admires the great tasks which the United Nations is performing in the economic  social  health and educational fields  and we believe that an expansion of work in these fields and the securing of the necessary funds for them would be the best and most constructive means for the creation of a better international community in which all people can live prosperously and in peace and security.206.	The Charter of the United Nations is a grand Charter. It contains all the principles cherished by man for a free  peaceful and secure life. But that goal cannot be achieved unless the spirit of justice encompasses all nations and unless all nations abide by the principles of the Charter and implement the resolutions based on it. Then and only then can freedom  equality and international peace and security prevail."
"97",5890,"ROU",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I first of all address to you  on behalf of the delegation of Romania  our most cordial congratulations on your election to the lofty post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. To see the Chair occupied by a representative of socialist Poland  with which Romania maintains brotherly relations and co-operates fully in every field  is for us a matter of particular satisfaction. I wish you complete success in the discharge of the lofty mission which has been entrusted to you and I wish to assure you of the complete co-operation of the delegation of Romania.30.	At the same time  I should like to express the appreciation of the delegation of Romania to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia.31.	I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to tell the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  of our great respect for him  and of the esteem we have for him because of his activities in the service of strengthening the Organization and increasing its role in international life.32.	I should also like to pay a tribute to U Thant for his untiring efforts and his devotion to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.33.	The participation of the Socialist Republic of Romania in international activities is based on a scientific analysis of the major changes taking place on the world stage and of the shifts occurring within the social and political forces which shape the development of the world today.34.	Indeed  an objective analysis of inter-State relations reveals an increase in the strength and the prestige of the socialist countries  the ever-growing affirmation of the States engaged on the road of independent development and of other peace-loving countries  and the rising influence of peoples and public opinion on international events. At the same time  we cannot neglect the significant changes taking place in the relative share of various countries in international life as a result of the technological and scientific revolution. The participation of small and medium-sized countries is being intensified. Those countries are highly interested in an effective participation in debating and solving the major world problems for the benefit of all peoples. All these changes convincingly show that the old imperialist policy of force and diktat is consistently losing ground and that there are ever better prospects for bringing about a new policy and new relations between States so as to avoid a conflagration and to establish a lasting peace. To lay a new and democratic basis for relations between States implies the recognition and integral application at all times by all States in respect of each and every one of the fundamental principles of international law  that is to say  complete equality of rights  national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in domestic affairs  mutual benefits  non-recourse to force or to the threat of force and the right of peoples freely to decide their own destiny.35.	The entire foreign policy of Romania consistently reflects those principles. Our country places at the center of its policy the intensification of friendly relations and all types of co-operation with socialist countries. It is constantly widening its co-operative relations with countries that have embarked on the road of independent development and it is broadening its relations on many levels with all States in the world.36.	In the conditions of our contemporary world  all nations have the right to participate and have an equal interest in the solution of the major problems which confront mankind. This makes it imperative that possibilities be created so that all States  irrespective of their strength  size  potential or social system  may directly participate in choosing the ways and means of doing so and in implementing measures capable of ensuring the general progress of mankind in an atmosphere of peace and understanding. Harmonizing efforts towards the achievement of these common goals requires the establishment of broad co-operation among States and the continuous improvement of forms and methods of co-operation and of their efficiency.37.	In this respect  the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a particularly important role to play  as bodies called upon to stimulate co-operation  to work out standards to govern relations between States and to ensure their implementation.38.	It is undeniable that for some time we have witnessed a process of increasing the role of the United Nations in international life. That is an eminently positive development which should be welcomed by all of us. Nevertheless  one cannot fail to note that  at the same time and many events bear witness to this there is a growing demand on the part of Member States that the United Nations role be further strengthened. Sometimes disappointments as well as justified apprehensions are felt in connexion with a certain erosion of the prestige of our Organization. It is a matter of public notoriety that many resolutions that have been adopted in this forum have not gone beyond a declaration of intent and have not led to effective measures that have a determining influence on the course of international life. Obviously  this is a very disturbing situation  since  given the responsibilities that we have towards peoples  we cannot afford to meet every year to discuss fundamental problems while the results of those discussions are minor and often lack in finality and effectiveness.39.	From this high rostrum the Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania addresses to all States and Governments of the world a pressing appeal to contribute their best to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and to raise its role in building a world of peace and coexistence based on understanding  friendship and international co-operation free from the specter of animosity and suspicion.40.	As stated by the President of the State Council  Nicolae Ceausescu:""Romania has always felt that the United Nations is called upon to act in such a manner as to favor multilateral co-operation among all nations of our planet  to promote in international life relations based on full equality of rights  which would exclude the use or the threat of force in relations among States. In our opinion  in present circumstances the United Nations can exercise a more important role in this regard.""41.	Is is precisely these imperatives of our time and the responsibility that is incumbent upon us as Members of an Organization in which peoples have placed so much hope that prompted the Government of Romania to request inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of an item entitled  ""Strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard to the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security  the development of co-operation among all nations and the promotion of the rules of international law in relations between States"". We wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that  thanks to your support this proposal has become an item on the agenda of the plenary Assembly [item 24].42.	Our initiative proceeds from the widely recognized need for the United Nations to act more firmly for the achievement of the goals inscribed in the Charter and for the observance and universal implementation of the fundamental principles of international law  and to see to it that all States refrain in their relations from the use or threat of force  from any pressure or constraint. The initiative also proceeds from the need to encourage the settlement of existing or potential disputes between States exclusively by peaceful means.43.	It is absolutely imperative that  in the fulfillment of its essential task to maintain and strengthen peace  the United Nations should contribute effectively to preventing and eliminating hotbeds of tension and conflict  to securing the conditions required for the free and independent development of all Member States  and to preventing the violation on any pretext of the sovereignty of any of them.44.	Any infringement of the independence and sovereignty of a State must be regarded as incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and as entailing appropriate consequences and measures. The Organization is also bound to contribute in a more substantial way to the achievement of disarmament  the liquidation of colonialism and neo-colonialism and the reduction of existing gaps  and give greater support to the efforts of the developing countries with a view to ensuring their economic and social progress.45.	In the last decades there have been deep transformations in the configuration of our contemporary world. The effectiveness of United Nations action depends to the largest extent on the Organization's ability adequately to express the realities of our time. Consequently  the forms of activity and the very structure of the Organization should reflect these new realities. It is in this context that the need is felt to ensure the widest possible participation of States  by virtue of the principle of universality  in the elaboration and implementation of decisions relating to problems of general interest  in all the activities of the Organization  and in securing a more judicious representation of all States in United Nations bodies. This approach  we are convinced  is fully in accord with the spirit and objectives of the United Nations Charter.46.	The delegation of Romania is convinced that consideration in plenary meetings of the item proposed by our country will provide an opportunity for a full debate on the most effective ways and means to strengthen the role of the United Nations in promoting international peace  security and co-operation. With that purpose in mind  the Romanian delegation is willing to work together with other delegations so that by joint efforts we may reach specific conclusions and suggest concrete measures apt to promote the achievement of the above-mentioned goals.47.	The Government of Romania  as is well known  attaches particular importance to the problem of strengthening international security. As we see it  consideration of this item at the present session should give new impetus to the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)] in all its provisions and  at the same time  should lead to the consideration and adoption of new measures capable of securing the elaboration of a common code of behavior to guide the members of the international community.48.	Bearing in mind the specific mutations and phenomena of our time and the most pressing requirements of international life that make indispensable the strengthening of international legality  Romania' believes that it is an imperative necessity to reach an agreement of a universal nature to consecrate the higher commandments of conduct and actions in inter-State relations  as well as the fundamental rights and duties of States. In our opinion  such a code should firmly proclaim the need to respect the sacred right of each nation to free existence  to sovereignty and independence  to peace and security; should reaffirm the obligation of all States to respect the right of each nation freely to decide its own destiny according to its interests and without any outside interference; should recognize the right of all States to self-defense by all means  including military means  against any attempt to violate their sovereignty and national independence; should recognize and establish the principle that no problem of interest to different States can be settled without the direct participation of and respect for the interests of all parties concerned; and should proclaim that any violation of the principles which should govern international relations and any interference in the affairs of other States would be regarded as acts contrary to peace and as offenses against the cause of international co-operation. All countries must solemnly reaffirm their obligation not to resort to the use or threat of force against another State. The Powers possessing nuclear weapons should undertake a commitment not to use or threaten to use those weapons against any State or in any circumstances.49.	At this session we are pleased to note an evolution towards detente that is asserting itself in an ever more manifest manner throughout the world. We are witnessing a process of a vast increase  on all continents  of international contacts  meetings and negotiations  in which States that for a long time had no dialog whatsoever are also participating. Thus we come to the conclusion that mankind is more and more aware of the fact that the only way to settle disputes is to negotiate with a view to reaching political solutions to all problems  no matter how difficult they might be.50.	Despite this positive development  it would be dangerous to be misled by the illusion that the problems facing mankind today have been or are on the way to being finally settled. We cannot afford to ignore or underestimate the gravity and the degree of harmfulness of certain military conflicts and hotbeds of tension that still persist in the world.51.	The Romanian Government resolutely demands that the flames of war in IndoChina be extinguished  that United States intervention against the heroic VietNamese people cease  that the bombings and other military actions stop and that United States troops be totally withdrawn  so as to enable this people  as well as the Cambodian and Laotian peoples  freely to solve their problems without any outside interference.52.	We support the declaration of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972  a document also widely supported by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  which represents a new  constructive initiative aimed at the political settlement of the VietNamese problem within the framework of the Paris talks. We likewise support the initiatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and those of the Patriotic Front of Laos.53.	While expressing its deep concern regarding the persistence of the state of tension in the Middle East  Romania favors a political solution of that conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  requiring the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories and assuring the integrity and sovereignty of every State in the area. At the same time  we consider we must act so as to find a solution to the problem of the Palestinian population in accordance with its legitimate interests and ensure appropriate conditions for its independent development.54.	The Romanian Government reasserts its position that no State has the right to raise territorial claims over other States under the pretext that this corresponds to its own needs of security and sovereignty. The security and sovereignty of a State cannot be ensured by territorial conquests but solely through a policy of friendship and peace with all neighboring States.55.	Romania highly appreciates the political initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which makes it possible to reach agreements that open up the road to normalization of relations between North and South Korea  to their peaceful and democratic reunification without any outside interference and to a unitary development of the Korean nation. Our Organization must also reach appropriate conclusions and act in support of this process.56.	In keeping with the fundamental interests of all peoples  Romania attaches particular attention to the achievement of general disarmament and in the first place of nuclear disarmament.57.	In view of the seriousness of this problem we are bound to state that  unfortunately  the negotiations that have been going on in Geneva for years have not produced results on a level with expectations. Without underestimating the significance of certain agreements on partial or collateral problems  we consider that too little has been achieved as far as the implementation of real measures of disarmament is concerned.58.	The Romanian Government is of the opinion that we must resolutely strive towards effective actions with a view to stopping the arms race  freezing and gradually reducing military budgets  establishing a concrete program to ban the use of thermonuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  halting the production  and liquidating the stockpiles  of such arms  adopting effective measures to dismantle foreign military bases and to secure the withdrawal of troops from the territories of other States. Furthermore  we must take these practical steps leading to a gradual reduction of national armed forces and the abolition of military blocs.59.	Romania has constantly urged the convening of a world disarmament conference and is resolutely working for this. We conceive of such a conference as a high governmental forum with general competence in the field of disarmament for debates and negotiations on the basis of universal participation. The Romanian Government considers that it would be appropriate for the General Assembly at its present session to adopt a decision on the convening of the conference under the auspices of the United Nations and that preliminary organizational provisions should be adopted so as to pave the way for practical preparations and for convening the conference at the earliest possible time.60.	In addition  the Romanian Government believes that the entire activity of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should be improved and expanded  made democratic and submitted to effective control on the part of world public opinion.61.	The evolution of political life in Europe has brought to light in the last few years the possibility of establishing new relations among the States of that continent and of achieving European security. As a European country  Romania has made its contribution to the improvement of the political climate on the continent  and has supported the positive steps taken towards recognition and respect for the realities in Europe and towards complete normalization and multilateral development of inter-European relations.62.	These positive trends should be continued and extended by establishing normal relations  in accordance with international law  with the two German States  as well as between the two German States themselves  and by admitting the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as Members with equal rights to the United Nations and other international bodies.63.	It is the view of the Romanian Government that European security requires the setting up of a system of clear obligations on the part of all States  and the adoption of concrete measures aimed at ruling out any act of the use or threat of force  pressure or constraint in relations among States in Europe. Such a system should guarantee the free and independent development of all countries  in accordance with the will of their peoples  as well as wide co-operation devoid of any barriers  on the basis of the principles of international law.64.	It is with those aims in mind that adequate preparations should be made for a conference on co-operation"" and security in Europe  to be convened as early as possible. That conference must be a democratic forum for all interested States to discuss and must adopt measures aimed at setting up new relations on the European continent  establishing appropriate conditions to overcome the present division into opposing military blocs  and creating a climate of understanding  good neighborliness and co-operation in every field of political  economic and social life.65.	It is in that context that efforts have been made towards closer co-operation among the Balkan States. Romania  which since 1957 has submitted proposals to this end  considers that it would be useful to prepare a meeting of representatives of the Balkan countries to discuss the question of transforming the Balkans into a zone of peace  co-operation and good neighborliness  and to reach agreement on the principles of economic  political  scientific and cultural co-operation among the Balkan countries.66.	The establishment of a European security system  as well as the conclusion of agreements on a subregional level  would open the way to the establishment of new relations on the continent. It is our belief that such relations would constitute a significant contribution to the general cause of strengthening peace and security in the world  and would have a considerable and particularly favorable effect on international life as a whole.67.	The Romanian people follows with feelings of deep solidarity the just struggle of the peoples of Africa and other continents for the preservation of their national entity and the abolition of the vestiges of colonial domination.68.	The resolute and consistent way in which Romania has always sided with peoples fighting for their liberation or concentrating their efforts on achieving political and economic independence enjoyed significant recognition in the warm and enthusiastic welcome given to the President of the State Council of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  on the occasion of the visit he paid this year to eight African States. That welcome eloquently demonstrated the feelings of friendship  esteem and solidarity binding the Romanian people and the peoples of the great African continent. That visit enabled the Romanian messengers to see for themselves the magnitude of the energy resources and creative capacity of those peoples  and the influx of fresh and constructive forces they can bring to the community of nations.69.	Romania grants active political  diplomatic and material support to the national liberation movements of the peoples of Guinea (Bissau)  Angola  Mozambique  Namibia and other Territories  and to the anti-colonialist struggle of peoples to conquer and consolidate their independence as States. We consider that new actions should resolutely be taken in order fully to implement the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. To that end  international recognition of the national liberation movements and the drawing up of concrete programs by the United Nations and its specialized agencies so as to give those movements material support would be of particular significance. It is also necessary for the United Nations to condemn in no uncertain terms the repression by the colonial Powers of the national liberation movements and to draw up practical measures for the prompt cessation of colonial domination and the proclamation of the independence of oppressed peoples.70.	We resolutely condemn the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination practiced by the racist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. We are in favor of the adoption of effective measures aimed at eliminating all forms of propagation of racism  prohibiting the instigation of hatred and discord among peoples  and banning propaganda against peace and humanity.71.	Underdevelopment represents one of the most important and grave problems bf contemporary society  one on whose solution the peace  progress and prosperity of the entire world depend.72.	The problem of eliminating the wide gap between the industrialized and the developing countries has at present acquired a world-wide dimension. For many long years we have been witnessing the tragic situation of a world where underdevelopment continues to worsen while vast material resources are wasted for military ends.73.	The international community  the United Nations and its specialized agencies are called upon to undertake action and to carry out programs to support more energetically the efforts of developing countries in order to ensure maximum development of their natural and human resources.74.	The multiplication of international economic relations and the development of exchanges of material and spiritual values among all States of the world in a spirit of equity and irrespective of their level of development or their social-political systems respond to an objective necessity of the contemporary age and constitute a fundamental prerequisite for universal progress.75.	Bearing in mind these realities  Romania  in view of the fact that it is itself a developing socialist country  consistently declares itself in favor of the intensification of international co-operation  which can accelerate the economic and social progress of all countries and  in the first place  of the countries which strive to liquidate the heavy heritage of the past. My country gives it support to all constructive actions undertaken within the framework of the United Nations and to the recommendations of UNCTAD.76.	My country  on whose initiative the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace  Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples was adopted in 1965 [resolution 2037(XX)]  continues to believe that a major concern of the international community should be an in-depth consideration of the complex problems of the young generations and the establishment of the necessary structures in order that youth may take an effective part in the economic and social development of peoples and have the possibility to express its opinions on all the essential questions of contemporary life.77.	These are the guiding principles and the fundamental options of socialist Romania in foreign affairs. It is in this spirit that Romania will ceaselessly work in order that the United Nations may make an increasingly active and effective contribution to the common endeavors of peoples to build a world where all nations  free and equal in rights  will be able to fulfill their legitimate aspirations to peace  well-being and progress."
"98",5936,"RUS",27,1972,"Comrade President  allow me first of all to congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the most important international political forum  the General Assembly of the United Nations. The unanimity displayed in your election is a reflection of the respect which States Members of the United Nations have for the peace-loving policies of the Polish People's Republic and for you personally.39.	We should also like to congratulate the Secretary- General of the United Nations  Mr. Waldheim. Although he has occupied the post of chief administrative officer of the United Nations for less than a year  he has already shown his desire to co-operate in ensuring that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance and strengthening of peace is enhanced and its activities in the solution of this main task under the United Nations Charter expanded.40.	It is logical and natural for sessions of the United Nations General Assembly to begin with a general political debate. Representatives of States Members of the United Nations assess the main international events  review the results of past United Nations activities in the light of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter  and set definite tasks for the future. The political impetus which the United Nations receives during the general debate is helpful in the subsequent consideration of the items on the agenda.41.	Even at last year's session of the General Assembly new trends were observed in relations among States which went some way towards meeting the desire of the peoples to secure lasting peace on the earth. Today there is reason to believe that these trends are growing stronger  although the forces opposed to a relaxation of tension in the world have not ceased their activities.42.	In these circumstances the United Nations should make new efforts to promote the solution of acute international problems. As a Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council  the Soviet Union will continue to make its contribution to the cause of the struggle for peace and the transformation of the United Nations into an even more effective instrument of peace.43.	The Soviet State will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Leninist formula of the state unity of the peoples of the Soviet Union contains a powerful potential for peace- building. A profound interest in peace is organically inherent in the voluntary and equal union of socialist republic which have joined efforts in a constructive endeavor for the good of their peoples  and predatory wars and the oppression of other peoples are organically alien to such a union.44.	For the Soviet Union the policy of peace is an adequate reflection  in the sphere of .external relations  of its internal social nature. In the decisions of the Twenty- fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  our country put forward a program of peace and international co-operation which  as is universally recognized  reflects not the narrow interests of any State or group of States but the aspirations of all peoples  of all mankind. Every step taken to implement it has a constructive influence on international development as a whole.45.	""Our policy of principle""  as Mr. L. I. Brezhnev  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  said  ""is the active defense of peace  freedom and the security of peoples. We are pursuing it together with our friends and allies  co-ordinating our steps in the international arena.""46.	If aggression is committed  the Soviet Union always sides with the victim of the aggression. If trouble threatens our allies and friends  we always come to their aid. And when we sign treaties  we implement them and fulfill our obligations.47.	The objectives for which the Soviet Union and all the countries of the socialist community have been tirelessly fighting for many years have taken concrete form in the positive changes which have come about in the international situation. Together with our allies and friends we shall continue to fight for peace  freedom and the progress of the peoples.48.	While consistently pursuing a policy of peace  the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community certainly do not claim to have a monopoly in this area. In the interests of peace  we are prepared to co-operate and we do co-operate with all States which are also prepared to do likewise. Whatever their social system and in whatever part of the world they may be situated  the door is closed to no one.49.	The broader the circle of countries pursuing a constructive foreign policy line and the larger the contribution each of them makes towards reducing tension  the more significant are the changes for the better in international affairs. Recent developments confirm this.50.	In the past  post-war periods have always turned out to be mere respites between wars. In the present circumstances real possibilities exist for a fundamentally different development  namely  a transition to a system of stable peace  in order to ensure which the United Nations was established.. 51.	This transition requires the solution of problems engendered by the Second World War and the special features of development during the subsequent quarter of a century. If we tried to express in the most general form the essence of the changes that have taken place  we should say that it consists in the fact that there is now a possibility of solving some of these problems  while constructive work has begun with a view to settling others.52.	The territorial realities that have arisen in Europe  the continent where both World Wars originated  are gaining universal recognition and being formalized under international law. The entry into force of the well-known treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with the USSR  signed at Moscow on 12 August 1970  and with the Polish People's Republic  signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970  confirms the inviolability of European boundaries  including the boundary between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the western boundary of Poland.53.	The conclusion of the agreement on West Berlin eliminates a chronic source of friction between States in the very center of Europe.54.	The clearing of the legacy of war from European soil must be completed through the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the requirements of observing the sovereignty and independence of both those States and settling relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of recognizing the Munich Agreement as invalid from the very beginning. As you know  negotiations are being held on this matter and I should like to express the hope that they will have a positive outcome.55.	Negotiations will soon take place on the conclusion of- a peace treaty between the USSR and Japan which should play its part in closing the book on the Second World War in Asia and in providing a lasting basis for peace and co-operation on that continent as well. For our part  we shall make efforts to ensure the success of these negotiations  but the same desire must of course exist on the other side too.56.	On the whole the ""cold war"" is being replaced by recognition of the truth that in the nuclear age there is no other basis for relations between States having different Social systems but peaceful coexistence. More and more often this is taking the form of binding international legal documents.57.	The prerequisites for many-sided and equal cooperation among States  in the political and other fields  are multiplying.58.	The high level of such co-operation attained in relations between the USSR and France is an especially conspicuous reflection of these new trends. Soviet-French relations are growing increasingly stronger and we note this with great satisfaction. The trends I have referred to are increasingly manifest in the Soviet Union's relations with a number of other States as well.59.	As a result of the Soviet-United States summit talks in Moscow in May of this year  a start has been made in the process of rebuilding relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.60.	-	Our country attaches great importance to its relations with the United States  a great Power wife a different social system. For our part we shall do everything in our power to develop these relations and we believe that this is in the interests of the Soviet and American peoples and in the interests of maintaining and strengthening international peace. The broadening of co-operation between the two countries has already begun to become a reality  although there remain and will remain political and ideological disagreements of principle between the Soviet Union and the United States as States having different social systems.61.	Naturally  we proceed from the assumption that no improvement in Soviet-United States relations should be achieved at the expense of other States. This is an important principle of our policy in relations with any State. It is our conviction that all States should be guided by this principle in their mutual relations and it is this criterion which we apply in assessing the significance of various developments in relations between different countries.62.	Since the first years after the Second World War  international relations have been complicated by the division of the world into military and political groupings which set some States against others and constantly carry the risk of a military conflict. The architects of the policy of establishing military blocs  pursuing the arms race and whipping up international tensions  who for a long time determined the foreign policy of the major Western capitalist Powers  worked hard to bring the world to the dangerous brink of a military conflict. Even today we are constantly encountering the consequences of that policy in various parts of the world.63.	We can therefore scarcely over-estimate the importance of even the first steps which are now being taken to lay the foundations of security on the basis of the collective efforts of all interested States.64.	We are now oh the eve of an all-European conference on questions of security and co-operation. Preparations for such a conference are to enter the practical phase very shortly. The great importance of this planned meeting of States lies in making Europe genuinely peaceful and in transforming relations among States on the European continent on the basis of mutual understanding and trust; we are in favor of such a policy and such a course of action in European affairs.65.	In the well-known Prague Declaration   the European socialist countries have already put forward their suggestions as to how  in their view  a system of security in Europe should be built up. Many other States have also expressed their views on this score. This is a great and extremely important task and the all-European conference is expected to make an important contribution to its solution.66.	We are convinced that  if all interested States and Governments show a proper responsibility and a readiness to seek solutions which would be in the common interest  the conference will go down in the history of our time as a great success for the cause of peace.67.	In Asia  too  the idea of ensuring security  which is equally in the interests of all Asian States  is also beginning to gain ground. The Soviet Union considers the question of security in Asia to be an important task also. TTiose who  for some reason  are not now in sympathy with it should understand that the countries of Asia are no less interested than the Soviet Union in strengthening peace in that area.68.	Although there has been noticeable progress towards a relaxation of international tension  it is hardly likely that anyone would dispute the fact that so far only a beginning has been made and that much more remains to be done. What is more  unless further progress is made and unless the efforts to achieve greater detente are intensified  all that has been gained could be lost. There have been such cases in history.69.	Some of the problems awaiting solution within an international framework affect the interests of practically all States. If we consider the substance of any of the problems leading to international complications and if we focus our attention on what directly generates the danger of war and the unleashing of military conflicts  we can only come to the conclusion that it is the use of force by some States against others for the purpose of territorial annexation and for the purpose of subjugating peoples and establishing domination over them  in other words  for predatory purposes.70 This has been true up to now and remains true today.71.	In the past tens and hundreds of millions of people in Asia  Africa and America were reduced to slavery by colonial force. Today  when almost all of them have freed themselves  the slightest opportunity is used to restore direct or indirect colonial domination over them.72.	Those who ventured in the past  and venture now  to use force for purposes which have nothing in common with the interests of the peoples are not greatly troubled by the fact that no dispute between States has ever been  or could ever be  settled on a lasting and just basis by means of force. The use of force for the purpose of aggression  territorial annexation and oppression of other peoples has as a rule laid the foundations for further hostility and further conflicts. For this the peoples have to pay  human beings perish and the great material treasures created by their toil are destroyed.73.	That is why progressive political leaders for almost as long as States themselves have existed have recognized the need to eliminate the use of force from relations between States. But mere understanding of this is  of course  not sufficient. Practical efforts by States are required. This is all the more necessary now that the presence and stockpiling bf nuclear weapons in the arsenals of States have radically changed the concept of the consequences which military conflicts can have for the peoples of the world.74.	Although varying views can be held as to the likelihood that this or that crisis or conflict will develop into a nuclear confrontation  as long as nuclear weapons exist  this possibility and this danger also exist. No State  no Government can ignore this. Our country believes that it is possible to eliminate or  at least  to reduce drastically the danger of a conflict between States provoking a nuclear catastrophe. That can be done if renunciation of the use of force in international relations is elevated to the level of international law and if at the same time-I repeat  at the same time the use of nuclear weapons js prohibited.75.	The Soviet Government is convinced that serious consideration of these questions cannot be put off any longer. The conditions for this are already more favorable now than before and the possibilities for adopting positive decisions are broader.76.	For those reasons  and because it is aware of its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council  the Soviet Union has submitted for consideration at the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly the item entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [A/8793].77.	The essence of our proposal is that it provides for the renunciation by States of any use of force to resolve international disputes; including the use both of nuclear weapons and of such types of weapons as are commonly called conventional. It is proposed that this renunciation be of such a nature that no one could avoid observing it strictly; this is possible if the United Nations shows the necessary understanding of its responsibility for the fate of the world.78.	Such an approach is fully in accordance with the fundamental principle proclaimed in the United Nations Charter under which the Members of the United Nations ""shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state  or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations"" [Article 2].79. The real state of affairs in the world makes it necessary to solve the question of the non-use of force in general and the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with each other.80. Ever since they first appeared  nuclear weapons have always been considered the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction. This is even truer now since the strength of these weapons is not a constant but is growing.81.	It would be wrong to lose sight of another aspect of the question: with the development of conventional types of weapons  the danger that they might be used in military conflicts has also increased several times even by comparison with the period of the Second World War. In the last quarter of a century nuclear weapons have not been used in military conflicts  yet who can be unaware of how many tragedies have been brought about by the use of conventional weapons and how numerous have been the victims of their use?82.	All this argues in favor of the prohibition of the use of force in violation of the United Nations Charter in conjunction with the prohibition of the use  first of all  of nuclear weapons  which are especially important.83.	The wisdom and expediency of such a decision have also been demonstrated by the experience which the United Nations has already gained in the consideration of problems of security and disarmament. The repeated attempts of the United Nations to find a solution to both these problems are fresh in everyone's memory. Attempts have been made now from one side  now from the other  now in terms of considering the question of the non-use of force  now in terms of considering the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. And what has transpired?84.	To take only recent years  the States Members of the United Nations have unanimously adopted a resolution on strict observance of the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations [resolution 2160 (XXI)]  a Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]  and a Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].85.	At the real core of all these documents is the principle of the non-use of force in international relations and of the settlement of all disputes between States solely by peaceful means. All the necessary formulations have been carefully worked out and weighed on the political scales and all aspects of the problem seem to have been taken into account  but it is no secret that the goals set have still not been fully achieved; force is being used and human blood is being shed.86.	More than 10 years ago  the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Declaration in which it proclaimed the use of nuclear weapons to be a crime against mankind and civilization [resolution 1653 (XVI)]. Since then the United Nations has repeatedly advocated the signing of an appropriate international convention by all States. However  the Declaration on the prohibition of the: use of nuclear weapons was not supported by all the nuclear Powers and it has still not been possible to initiate productive negotiations on the conclusion of an international convention on the question.87.	Many reasons can be found for the ineffectiveness of the decisions adopted by the United Nations on these questions  but one of the most substantial is unarguably that they were considered and decided upon by the United Nations in isolation from one another.88.	When the question of prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons was raised  several States had doubts as to the possibility of taking such a step if the use of force was not precluded in relations between States. We shall not now enter into a discussion of the question of the extent to which those doubts were justified but  whatever the case  they became an obstacle to agreement.89.	At the same time  when the question of prohibiting the use of force was considered  the significance of any decisions adopted proved to be limited in the absence of agreement concerning nuclear weapons  that is to say  the most powerful weapons of mass destruction. The separation of one question from the other introduced a certain lack of understanding and suspicion and weakened the effectiveness of the best decisions of the United Nations. Furthermore  their effectiveness was further restricted because they were all in the form of recommendations  or  at best  declarations of intent. They were not given the force of law.90.	The proposal of the Soviet Union [A/8793] envisages the adoption of the most realistic and effective decision possible in modern conditions. It is precisely such a decision which is in the interests of all States  regardless of their social systems  the size of their territory and population  or whether or not they possess nuclear weapons.91.	As a result of such a decision  those States which are militarily stronger  and above all the nuclear Powers  will obtain greater mutual assurance that they are under no threat from one another. The security of each of them will be safeguarded more reliably and at the same time on an equal basis  that is to say  no one will gain a unilateral advantage at the expense of another in comparison with the situation which prevails at present  and no one would lose anything.92.	Those States which are militarily less powerful  including all those which do not possess nuclear weapons  would also gain. Now  they are justifiably concerned at the danger that nuclear weapons might be directed against them if aggression is committed. The prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with the renunciation of the use of force would remove this threat and greatly strengthen the security of all States.93.	It goes without saying that the obligation of States to renounce the use of force  including nuclear weapons  can in no way impair their right to individual and collective self-defense as laid down in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On the contrary  that obligation would reinforce the right to self-defense against aggression and the right to struggle to eliminate the consequences of aggression in cases where it has already been committed and the aggressor seeks to benefit from it.94.	No one can challenge the inalienable right of States and peoples subjected to aggression to repulse it by employing all possible means so long as the aggressor continues to use force  encroaches upon their freedom and sovereignty and tries to retain territories seized by force. It will suffice to refer to the examples before everyone's eyes: Indochina and the Middle East. Who would dare to contest the incontestable fact that brute force has been and still is being used against the peoples of Indochina and against the Arab States and that they are entitled to use all the necessary means to rebuff the aggressor?95.	Renunciation of the use of force in relations between States in no way limits the right of the peoples of colonial countries to fight for their freedom and independence using any means which may be necessary in that struggle. This right is recognized by the United Nations as being a legitimate one. It is based on the fact that violence was used against those peoples  who have been the victims of colonialism and aggression  and  in resorting to force to liberate themselves  they are only restoring justice and their flouted rights.96.	The adoption of a decision on non-use of force and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would thus be beneficial to all. But this also makes it necessary for all States  particularly all those Powers which possess nuclear weapons  to participate in its elaboration and adoption. Otherwise no decision  not even the very best one  could attain the desired objective.97.	The Soviet Government has given thorough consideration to the question of the most appropriate form for a decision by the United Nations on the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. We propose that consideration of this item should result in the adoption of a clear-cut decision  which  in the interests of maximum effectiveness  should bind together appropriate actions by the two main organs of the United Nations the General Assembly and the Security Council. On behalf of the Soviet Union  the Soviet delegation is submitting the following draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly:[The speaker then read out the text of a draft resolution which was subsequently circulated as document A/L.676. For the text  see Official Records of the General Assembly  Twenty-seventh session  Annexes  agenda item 25.]98.	The proposed draft speaks for itself. It envisages a major step on the part of the General Assembly a decision on behalf of States Members of the United Nations on their renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. It contains an appeal to the Security Council to take action to make this declaration binding on all States. For this purpose  and in accordance with well-known provisions of the United Nations Charter  a meeting of the Security Council should be convened at the level of members of Governments or other specially designated representatives.99.	The Soviet delegation is authorized to state that the Soviet Union will stand ready to participate in the convening of such a meeting of the Security Council and in its work. We shall be ready to join in this political action with all other States which are permanent members of the Council. We are convinced that there can be no higher duty for those States on which the Charter of the United Nations places a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.100.	We appeal to all States represented in the General Assembly to study carefully the draft we have submitted and  on the basis ""of it  to adopt-unanimously a resolution which will reflect the firm will of this world Organization to put an end to any use of force in relations between States in violation of the United Nations Charter and to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.101.	In so doing  the United Nations will be giving strong support to the cause of a further relaxation of international tension  the strengthening of peace and increased mutual understanding in relations between States. This step will be in the interests of all those to whom peace  security and peaceful coexistence are not merely words but a guide for action.102.	The task of building a lasting peace requires the adoption of effective measures to prevent and avert military conflicts in the future. But it is no less important to put an end to the conflicts which are poisoning the international atmosphere now and to put out the military fires in areas where the right of peoples to be masters of their own destinies is being encroached upon. Lack of progress in settling these problems cannot but cause deep anxiety for the future course of world affairs.103.	The position of the Soviet Union concerning the war against the Vietnamese people is known to all. The continuation and expansion of the United States intervention in Viet-Nam and other countries of Indochina provoke indignation and condemnation. Probably never before have so many declarations been made containing promises to leave Viet-Nam and to stop the war as have been made recently. And never before has there been such a striking contrast between words and deeds. No matter how much the United States manipulates reports on reductions in the strength of the United States infantry in Viet-Nam in order to appease the public  behind those reports there is in reality an unprecedented expansion of military activities and of their cruelty and inhumanity. No matter how many assurances it gives us that it does not wish to settle the internal affairs of the Viet-Nam people for them  it is in fact pursuing a policy that is aimed at eliminating the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the people's armed forces of liberation and at preserving the Saigon puppet administration as the sole legitimate authority in South Viet-Nam.104.	One can only wonder why the only correct conclusion has not yet been drawn: namely  that the Vietnamese people cannot be defeated. Their resistance will not be broken either by heavier bombing  the blockading of ports or damage to hydro-technical installations. The Vietnamese people are fighting heroically against aggression and fighting for just aims  in order to be master in their own country. They cannot allow anyone from outside to prescribe a political and social system for them or to impose puppets who uphold interests that are foreign to the Vietnamese people.105.	A way out can be found  but only through serious negotiations  for which a constructive basis has been provided by the well-known proposals contained in the statements by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972 and by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam of 14 September 1972.106.	The essence of these proposals is clear and simple. The United States of America must respect the right of the Vietnamese people to genuine independence and the right of the people of South Viet-Nam to self-determination. It must stop the war of aggression in Viet-Nam. put an end to the bombing and mining  the blockade and all military activities in Viet-Nam  renounce the policy of the ""Vietnamization"" of the war  immediately withdraw all United States troops from South Viet-Nam and discontinue its military participation and support of the Saigon puppet regime. In the solution of the internal problem of South Viet-Nam  it is essential to work on the basis of the real situation: two authorities  two armies and other political forces exist there. The basis for the solution of the problem lies in the equality of the parties and a rejection of annexation. To that end it is necessary to set up in South Viet-Nam a provisional Government which has been agreed on nationally on a tripartite basis and which will handle all matters during the transitional period and organize general elections on truly free and democratic lines.107.	All those who respect the rights of the peoples and all those who have not lost the ability to assess the state of affairs objectively cannot but recognize that these proposals are very well founded  reasonable and logical and that they express the goodwill of the Vietnamese people. They cannot but reject categorically allegations that the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is trying to impose a ""Communist regime"" on South Viet-Nam.108.	If the United States of America wants the negotiations in Paris to lead to the restoration of peace  it should reply positively to the statement by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972. If  however  it is pursuing some other goal  then the talks in Paris can only lead to a deadlock  the war will continue and the full responsibility for it will rest with the United States of America.109.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned  it fully supports the proposals by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. All those who cherish the ideals of freedom and independence cannot fail to have a sense of solidarity with the Vietnamese people in their struggle.110.	A solution to the problems of the Middle East must be found. Recent events linked with the new criminal acts of aggression by Israel against Arab countries  including Lebanon  show how serious is the danger and how far the Israeli leaders are going in their reckless policy.111.	The responsibility which rests with the aggressors is shared by all those who protect them and whose support enables Israel to defy the United Nations and its decisions regarding the elimination of the consequences of the aggression and the restoration of peace in the Middle East. The Israeli leaders must know that an adventurist policy can lead only to apparent success and that in the final analysis it will inevitably entail retribution.112.	The attempts to appropriate Arab lands and repeated military acts of aggression cannot be tolerated. The UnitedNations has the necessary right and the possibilities to put the aggressor in his place.113.	Only a long-term and just settlement in the Middle East in accordance with the well-known decisions of the United Nations can ensure the peace and security of all-we repeat  all-States in this region. The Israeli troops must be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967.114.	For the Soviet Union  support for the legitimate demands of the Arab countries  for the United Nations decisions regarding a political settlement of the Middle East conflict  and for the mission of Ambassador Jarring is a policy of principle. We are pursuing it and we shall continue to pursue it unswervingly.115.	We also support the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for the restoration of their inalienable rights  which have been recognized by the United Nations. At the same time  we cannot  of course  condone the acts of terrorism committed by certain elements among the members of the Palestinian movement which have led  among other things  to the recent tragic events in Munich. Their criminal acts also strike a blow at the national interests and aspirations of the Palestinians and are used by the Israeli criminals to cover up their own piratical policy against the Arab peoples.116.	On the basis of positions of principle  the Soviet Union opposes acts of terrorism which disrupt the diplomatic activities of States and their representatives  transport communications between them and the normal course of international contacts and meetings  and it opposes acts of violence which serve no positive end and cause loss of human life.117.	Peace will not be truly lasting until an end is put to the arms race  which is one of the main sources of distrust among States and of an increased danger of war. The struggle for disarmament has been going on for a long time The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community see in the struggle for disarmament one of the main orientations for their foreign policy activities. And this policy will be continued. Some of the things that seemed almost unattainable even 10 or 15 years ago are now reflected in treaties and agreements that have entered into force. These include some which to a certain extent curb the nuclear arms race and reduce the threat of nuclear war: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII)  annex]  the Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the three environments  and others. In addition  the first agreement in history on the elimination of a type of armaments which falls within the category of means of mass destruction  namely  bacteriological and toxin weapons  has now been concluded.118.	To the sum total of obligations in the field of the limitation of the arms race and disarmament already assumed by the majority of States  one more has recently been added: it concerns those types of armaments which have the greatest destructive force. I am referring to the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements  signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972. Limiting to the minimum the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems  the agreements eliminate one of the main motives for unleashing a competition between offensive and defensive missile weapons  the full consequences of which are difficult to predict. By establishing quantitative limits for strategic offensive arms for the first time  the agreements curb the most dangerous trend in the arms race.119.	The conclusion of the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements is an important step which will help to reduce the threat of nuclear war and to curb the arms race and which will open up new prospects for progress towards general disarmament. Both sides have agreed to continue the talks with a view to arriving at further agreements in that direction.120.	Each successful step in the struggle to limit the arms race is important in its own right and is  at the same time  important as a starting point for further efforts. The possibilities for further progress towards the solution of new disarmament problems will increase with each new step on which agreement is reached. Our country has always desired this and we shall spare no effort in continuing to work  together with all other States  to relieve the peoples of the burden of weapons.121.	The Soviet Union favors the earliest possible solution of the question of the halting of the production of chemical weapons and their destruction  concerning which negotiations are being held in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. It also favors the halting everywhere and by everyone of nuclear weapon tests  including underground tests  the elimination of foreign military bases on alien territory and the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.122.	States have acquired a great deal of experience in negotiations on disarmament. Various methods have been used and are being used; some of them have fully justified themselves and should be used further. At the same time it can hardly be considered proper that  since the advent of the nuclear age  there has not yet been a single occasion on which States have all gathered together to consider the question of disarmament  which affects all States  socialist and capitalist  large and small  developed and developing  nuclear  and non-nuclear. We can therefore only welcome the fact that the idea of convening a world disarmament conference has become one of the most popular ideas among the States of the world and among world public opinion.123.	The General Assembly will be considering in a specific manner the question of convening a world disarmament conference [item 26]. Our views on this are well known. We consider that this conference should be a forum at which all countries without exception could present and compare  on an equal basis  their views on the whole range of disarmament questions and come to agreement on practical steps designed to curb the arms race and achieve disarmament. This applies both to weapons of mass destruction and to conventional weapons.124.	The Soviet Government believes that full advantage should be taken of the opportunities that are now taking shape for the convening of a world disarmament conference. We  for our part  shall continue to do everything in our power to ensure that it is held and is successful.125.	The question of the strengthening of international security is once again on the agenda of the General Assembly [item 35]  This problem is an urgent one and will remain so as long as there are forces at work which are interested not in implementing the principles of the United Nations Charter but in aggravating international tension and suppressing the liberation struggle of the peoples.126.	Great victories have been won by the peoples in their struggle to eliminate colonial oppression. But this problem has not yet been completely solved and millions of people are still living under the colonial and racist yoke.127.	The Soviet Union  which was the first country in the history of the world to eradicate national oppression and to ensure genuine prosperity for dozens of nations and nationalities  is irreconcilably opposed to all manifestations of racism  apartheid  colonialism and neocolonialism. Our country opposes all attempts to exert pressure direct or indirect-on States which  after a hard struggle  have won the right to independent development and are now building their national economies  carrying out progressive social and economic reforms and defending their rights to own the natural resources that belong to them. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist those States in every way possible to strengthen their sovereignty and independence.128.	In international politics it is necessary constantly to take account of the various questions posed by scientific and technological progress and the requirements which such progress is making on an ever-increasing scale in the field of international co-operation. This applies to economic  scientific and technological links  which are becoming ever richer in content. It applies directly to new areas in which States are active  particularly outer space.129.	It was on the basis of those considerations that the Soviet Union submitted proposals on principles governing the activities of States in outer space  on the conclusion of a treaty concerning the moon and on a number of other matters. At the current session of the General Assembly we are proposing that consideration should be given to the item entitled ""Preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting"" [item 37]. Our purpose in raising this question is to link inseparably  from the very beginning  the use of this new type of space technology to the noble purposes of strengthening peace and friendship among peoples.130.	The United Nations must promptly acquire a genuinely universal character. Universality could lend the United Nations new strength and enable it to consider world problems with greater results. We therefore see no justification for attempts to create artificial obstacle to the admission of new States to the United Nations.131.	We consider it necessary to ensure the earliest possible admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic  which is fully entitled to be admitted  as is  of course  the Federal Republic of Germany too. This will be in the interests of the further development of co-operation among States and will be in line with the political situation taking shape in Europe.132.	No one should cast doubt on the legitimate right to membership in the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  which has recently gained its national independence. That State has a legitimate right to become a Member of the United Nations.133.	In general  the United Nations should rid itself as quickly as possible of the burden of the past  which is still making itself felt in its activities in various spheres. One such sphere is that of questions relating to Korea. This year there are new possibilities before the General Assembly for a constructive approach to the discussion and solution of these questions. Such possibilities had been afforded by the proposal put forward by the non-aligned and socialist States concerning the ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea"" [A/8752 and Add. 1-10]. But those who in the past created a hotbed of tension in the Korean region and are now trying to maintain it have prevented the General Assembly from considering this proposal at the current session. Everyone understands that an artificial delay in this case can only be harmful and that those States which resort to such methods are showing themselves to be opposed to a just settlement in the interests of the normalization of the situation in Korea and the strengthening of peace in that area.134.	As to the Soviet Union  our position on the question of Korea has been set out many times. We are in favor of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and support the measures and efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful unification of the country.135.	During the period in which the United Nations has existed  attempts have been made on more than one occasion to destroy its Charter. Whatever the subjective intentions of those who are now raising the question of the review of the United Nations Charter  the objective reality is such that this will entail great dangers for all the activities of the United Nations.136.	The Soviet Union considers that the interests of all States without exception require that attention should be focused not on a revision of the United Nations Charter but on its strict observance and on fuller utilization of the possibilities it affords.137.	What is necessary for the United Nations to succeed is the readiness and determination of Member States to act together in the interests of solving the problems facing the Organization. This should make the United Nations a real center for concerted action by nations to achieve common goals  which is an obligation under the United Nations Charter.138.	Those who seek to divide the United Nations either according to the principle of the size of the territory orpopulation of States or by classifying them as ""rich"" and ""poor"" are doing a disservice not only to the United Nations but also to the cause of preserving and strengthening peace as a whole.139  That is not what inspired the founders of the United Nations. They wanted the United Nations to be strong and firm in rebuffing aggressors and to be capable of promoting co-operation among all countries irrespective of their size and level of economic development.| 140. As to the Soviet Union  it has invariably done and will continue to do everything it can to ensure that the United Nations acts precisely in that manner. The policy of the struggle for peace and security is the general policy of the Soviet Union in the international arena. That policy was adopted half a century ago by. the socialist republics which joined together to form the Soviet Union and it is still the policy today.141.	The twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is a regular session. But it could become a prominent landmark in the formation of a new system of peaceful relations among States. For this purpose it should focus its attention on the main and most acute political problems brought to the fore by life itself and the whole course of international development."
"99",5983,"RWA",27,1972,"Mr. President  my delegation joins with those delegations that have preceded us on this rostrum in conveying to you our warmest congratulations on your brilliant election to preside over the work of this twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly. We do this with all the more pleasure and happiness since you come from Poland  a country with which Rwanda maintains very friendly relations.2.	I should also like to express once again the great appreciation of my delegation to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  for the impartiality and the great sense of diplomacy with which he guided the work of the twenty- sixth session.3.	Moreover  this Assembly is entitled to a special word of gratitude from my delegation since it has elected our country to one of the posts of Vice-President. Rwanda is highly honored at this special mark of confidence  and  consistent with its traditions  commits itself to make its total contribution to the complete success of the work of this session.4.	In all of its foreign policy Rwanda is guided by the principles of the Charter of our Organization and by the need for co-operation among nations to safeguard peace  to create security for all  and to promote the best living conditions for the popular masses of all countries.5.	At the time of my country's admission to this Organization  10 years ago  our Head of State  Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda  the father of our country  said the following:""The Rwandese Republic will be found in the ranks of those who have already worked so hard for true decolonization  which leads to better conditions for development and progress. We stand beside those who are striving for an equitable distribution of the benefits deriving from progress  in the various forms of technical and financialassistance. We stand beside those who seek the abolition of methods based on discrimination and violence. We stand beside those who who are endeavoring to create or strengthen  realistically  joint organs for co-operation among nations. We stand beside all those who seek every peaceful means of guaranteeing and promoting the fullest exercise of fundamental freedoms. [1122nd meeting  para. 103. ]6.	That commitment expressed 10 years ago still reverberates in the hearts of the Rwandese people  and there could be no more resounding echo of this solemn act of faith than the following wise words pronounced  again by our Head of State  on the occasion of the New Year's celebration of 1972:""We hope that collaboration between countries will increasingly take as its basis brotherhood among men and that this approach will facilitate any negotiations that may become necessary. We hope that in all countries the various efforts to promote development will be faithfully co-ordinated and that they will be crowned with success for all of our peoples. We would like to see diplomatic and technical missions all over the world make a real contribution to true understanding between groups and countries and to a more equitable distribution of labor and goods.""7.	Both at home and abroad Rwanda  therefore  is working for peace and the happiness of peoples  inspired by the principles set forth earlier in this statement.8.	At home  thanks to the dynamism displayed by its people  which has withstood all tests  Rwanda  through the popular revolution of 1959  has been able to throw off the feudal ties formed by the Tutsi ethnic group  which was deeply anchored in its barbarous customs and traditions and which  through maneuvers and intrigues of all kinds  mercilessly exploited the Hutu ethnic group  although that group represented the overwhelming majority  90 per cent  of the population of the country. The popular masses of Rwanda  after having thrown off these tyrants  now enjoy true peace and real public tranquility which are founded on a social harmony that rules out any inequality based on ethnic or other considerations. It is all the more painful for us to see in a neighboring country that a feudal minority has set forth its own program to exterminate a majority  founding its decisions solely on racial considerations which have been condemned by history. We publicly condemn this systematic genocide directed against the majority ethnic group as strongly as we have never ceased to condemn the inhuman policy of racial segregation in South Africa and that of the so-called Government of Southern Rhodesia  as well as the colonialism which Portugal imposes on the African populations in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).9.	Rwanda expresses once again its concern over the attitude of the Government of South Africa  which continues to ignore the various United Nations resolutions adopted to help the peoples under the domination of the Pretoria regime. We hope that this session will decree effective measures designed to set up everywhere a regime of freedom and human dignity.10.	The Rhodesian problem is equally a matter of concern because of its ramifications. Thanks to the complicity of the economic and financial interests of the great Western Powers in particular  the black people of Southern Rhodesia are denied their rights to human dignity and self- determination. I continue to believe that the British Government remains fully responsible for the state of affairs which prevails in Southern Rhodesia.11.	It is in the light of the principles enshrined in the Charter that my Government has never ceased to condemn the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of Pretoria  as well as the racist policy exercised by a white minority over the black population of Rhodesia. In speaking out against this policy  we are at the same time condemning all foreign Powers which wish to convert the southern part of Africa into a land where the white man would rule over the colored people.12.	We unreservedly support the national liberation movements which are clamoring for genuine national independence.13.	When we consider the means to be used to achieve this goal  we think that  in addition to armed struggle  we should not lose sight of peaceful means capable of leading to the same goal. In this connexion  our Head of State  His Excellency Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda  expressed himself clearly in these terms  so fraught with wisdom  on the occasion of the New Year's celebration in 1972:""We would like to see decolonization advance on valid foundations and without the violence we have sometimes had occasion to witness. And here we should be quite clear that  whether it be the stubborn attitude of Portugal or the present leaders of South Africa or those in Southern Rhodesia  whether it be the liberation fighters all too comfortably installed outside their country all of this is violence in contradiction to the goodness which triggers the movement of history if it is spearheaded by men of clear vision and honesty. We believe that patient negotiations-adroit  if need be  but energetic and loyal- aided by all of us  will overcome the stubborn colonialists.""14.	While southern Africa is thus suffering from this scourge of apartheid and colonialism  certain parts of Asia are equally afflicted by senseless wars in which the victims are counted in the thousands.15.	The Viet-Nam war has obviously lasted too long. My Government cannot take any sides in this question which  in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter  should be settled by honest negotiations and not by weapons. We retain the firm hope that the Paris negotiations on Viet-Nam will soon find an end to the present impasse and lead to a solution mutually acceptable to the two parties to the dispute.16.	It would be useful for the diplomats who are conducting the Paris negotiations on Viet-Nam to be guided by the words uttered by our Head of State on 19 December 1971 at the opening of the meeting of foreign diplomats accredited to Rwanda:""Our method  to sum up  is frank negotiation. The Ambassador of Rwanda is prohibited from losing time in old methods which sidestep the main issues  with interminable gestures of protocol; neither can he use the condemned methods of launching trial balloons to see the reaction or to foster misunderstandings between negotiators; he must go straight to the point  pinpoint responsibilities  explain clearly the point of view of his Government in bringing out and presenting the conclusion that he is sustaining. He should agree to discussion  always provided that it is direct and frank  accepting the concessions that are possible and likely to lead to an effective common agreement. Accordingly  lies  various subterfuges  distortions and all forms of dishonesty are forbidden to him and the preference is given to clear  direct negotiation  as is proper between sincere brothers.""17.	Now  what of the problem of the Middle East? This  too  is a subject of great concern to my Government. The imperative need for peace and security in that region of the world also requires that the two parties to the dispute  Israel and the Arab States  should accept negotiation as the only valid and equitable means of ending this painful dispute which has cast so many families into mourning and left so many orphans. For my country  the solution of the problem is to be found in the total application of resolution 242 (1967) of the Security Council.18.	I should like to touch on another  equally thorny question  that of divided Korea. In this connexion  Rwanda firmly encourages the current talks between the two parties to find ways and means of reuniting the families divided as a result of the setting up of the demarcation line between the two Koreas. It is the duty of this international Organization to support such initiatives undertaken by the Koreans themselves to settle their own problem  rather than becoming involved  since the parties concerned can settle the matter in a more realistic fashion. The essential is that this should be a loyal and peaceful effort.19.	Thus  Rwanda  just as it condemns apartheid which rages in South Africa  has equally no fear in denouncing racism wherever it is practiced  even if it is exercised by blacks over other blacks  as is being done in that country of black Africa where an ethnic minority is in the process of exterminating  in the name of racism  another ethnic group which is none the less in the majority. Whether we are talking about the Middle East or Burundi  Rwanda hopes that this problem will be solved by means of negotiation. Whether we are dealing with Korea or Germany  Rwanda would like to see the reunification of these countries by peaceful means  with frank and definite proposals for collaboration put forward.20.	I would like to raise another problem here which has a particular aspect: that of good relations of States with their neighbors. In this connexion I should like once again to dispel any misunderstandings that may have emerged concerning the policy of Rwanda on this score  and particularly with respect to its neighbor to the north  Uganda.21.	Certain foreign radio broadcasts have echoed rumors tending to present Rwanda as helping certain armed groups which are ready to attack Uganda. These rumors are completely devoid of foundation; they are only a false maneuver prepared by impenitent feudal groups and orchestrated by the enemies of Africa to sabotage the friendly relations existing between the Republic of Rwanda and Uganda. My country categorically denies those false reports and wishes to make clear that it does not shelter on its territory any armed foreign corps preparing an attack against its neighbors. Certain radio broadcasts have mentioned Israeli mercenaries. My Government would like to deny these rumors. As far as Israelis are concerned  in my country there are only the diplomatic personnel of the Embassy that has been installed at Kigali since 1964.22.	For its part  my Government  anxious to ensure this policy of good neighborliness  abides by the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. Therefore  neighboring countries  and in particular Uganda  have absolutely nothing to fear from my Government. It would  however  be desirable if our international jurists could succeed in defining for us more clearly what are the domestic affairs of another country  so as not to encourage indifference by some parties to situations which violate the right to life of all human beings. The case of Burundi  where more than 200 000 innocent victims have just been massacred  and the cases of the Middle East and of South Africa would serve as examples to be used in such a study.23.	In no circumstances and at no price could Rwanda allow its country to be used as a haven for outlaws or mercenaries of any kind. The firm attitude that my country took in 1967 vis-a-vis the mercenaries expelled from Zaire and then from Rwanda  where they had taken asylum  is known to all. As far as we are concerned  respect for the principle of good neighborliness is a sacred tenet.24.	I turn now to the problem of disarmament. We all know that every year States  and particularly the great Powers  allocate vast sums further to perfect their armaments. But we also know that these funds could be better used if they were devoted to promote development. Every year more than $200 000 million and a great many scientists are diverted from genuinely positive purposes to destructive ends. Rwanda is  however  gratified at the efforts which our Organization has unceasingly made  perhaps slowly  but surely  to avert this danger  which is pushing mankind towards its own suicide through the manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. In this connexion  we should refer to the various resolutions and treaties which have been adopted within the framework of the United Nations concerning various aspects of disarmament .25.	In this connexion we should recall resolution 41 (I) of 14 December 1946 concerning measures designed to reduce armaments and eliminate atomic weapons; resolution 1378 (XIV) of 20 November 1959 concerning general and complete disarmament; the Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water of 1963; resolution 2030 (XX) of 29 November 1965 concerning the convening of a world disarmament conference; the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]; resolution 2602 E (XXIV) of 16 December 1969 which proclaimed the Disarmament Decade beginning in 1970; resolution 2661 A (XXV) of 7 December 1970  urgently calling upon the Governments which are nuclear Powers immediately to put an end to the nuclear arms race  to cease all testing and to refrain from setting up offensive and defensive nuclear weapons systems; resolution 2660 (XXV) of 7 December 1970 containing the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof  as well as the signature of the aforementioned Treaty on 11 February 1971; resolution 2826 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971 containing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and toxin weapons and on their Destruction  open to the signature of States since 10 April 1972; the signing at Moscow by the Soviet Union and United States of America  during the month of May 1972  of an Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.26.	All States of the world should support all of these efforts which are designed to bring about general and complete disarmament  for the responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security is not the monopoly of certain States  but the duty of all.27.	I must  however  repeat the words of my President  Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda:""We must not confuse disarmament with the regimentation of science. For scientific research must continue for the progress of mankind. We should only avoid utilizing the results of this research for war or for other negative purposes""28.	We would rather reaffirm the fact that the reduction and later the elimination of expenditure for armaments would be beneficial for the development of the less favored countries  if all States  particularly those which are wealthy  would wish to embark decisively upon a course of genuine international co-operation  one of the overriding imperatives of our time. And as was stated by Mr. Gregoire Kayibanda  our eminent Chief of State:""To make peace is also to disarm. The Government of Rwanda does not consider the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction as the only threat to peace. To disarm is to convert the expenditures on armaments and military equipment into instruments in the struggle against under-development.""29.	Thus  the vast amounts of money  material resources and human energy spent for armaments should be used for the liberation of the three quarters of mankind who suffer from hunger  ignorance and disease. This is the place to reaffirm that the wealthier countries will make no progress without risk  except to the extent that they support the great struggle which is being waged by the less favored countries against under-development.30.	The delegation of Rwanda has never ceased to express its increasing concern at the fact that the development of the younger nations is paralyzed partly by the decline in world prices for commodities and  on the other hand  by the parallel increase in the price of manufactured goods.31.	On the question of world prices for primary commodities  when the relevant agreements on commodities are concluded  Rwanda would like to see the less advanced countries get special attention and benefit from preferential treatment  such as the broadening and  in some cases  the elimination of quotas which limit their export ceilings  and we would like these countries to be exempted from making contributions for the purpose of financing buffer stocks.32.	In the case of the manufactured and semi-manufactured goods exported by the less advanced countries to the developed countries  these products should be traded free of all duties and taxes. The developed countries have no reason to be hostile to such an arrangement  in as much as the quantity of the products involved is very limited.33.	With respect to the fundamental problem of the actual financing of development  the delegation of Rwanda would like to reaffirm the position that it defended in the course of the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]  which was just held this year  a position which is explained in a few clear propositions  as follows.34.	First  a special allocation of special drawing rights should be urgently granted to those countries which  as a result of the devaluation of the dollar  have suffered considerable losses in their export receipts.35.	Secondly  we should reverse the current flow of international aid which continues to be allocated to the more advanced of the recipient countries so that it would go first to those that need it most  that is to say  to the least developed of the under-developed countries.36.	Thirdly  bilateral and international assistance should do away with the various counterpart funds habitually demanded from the less advanced countries when financial agreements for development projects or technical assistance and personnel projects are concluded.37.	Fourthly  we should fight against the principle of aid with conditions attached which deprive the recipient countries of the power of decision over priorities or other ways of using such aid.38.	With respect to the problem of land-locked countries  among which I include my own  we should repeat our great satisfaction that the lack of a coastline the fact that a country is land-locked is accepted as one of the criteria which are used to define the concept of a ""less advanced country"" among the developing countries. Moreover  we should like to renew the appeal that our delegation made last year from this rostrum to the effect that countries which have not done so yet should without further delay give their support to the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States  signed at New York on 8 July 1965. Moreover  it would not be out of order to call upon countries through which the goods of land-locked countries pass in transit to grant the latter all transit facilities  such as the elimination of bonds and other transit duties and the creation of free zones. We should also hope that shipping rates would be fixed and maintained at a reasonable level.39.	I have already spoken of the fundamental problem of financing development. We can never stress this point sufficiently. As is known  in most of the developing countries the fulfillment of the national development plan depends in large measure on bilateral or multilateral foreign aid.40.	Moreover  let us note that when we break down the structure of this foreign aid  both bilateral and multilateral  we see that the largest portion  approximately 61 per cent  is expended for foreign technical assistance personnel in wages  housing  transport and exorbitant privileges.41.	It is probably true that the developing countries generally do not yet have an adequate number of the technicians needed to provide the leadership required for the development of their countries. But this is no reason to justify the fact that the industrialized and developed countries send them inexperienced technicians or people with less training  sometimes  than a number of persons available locally. Now  as it happens  very often  the granting of funds is tied to the acceptance of technicians from the donor country  and here we find ourselves again in a vicious circle  since it is these same technicians who receive the largest piece of the cake in the allocation of aid to the various sectors. This is the neo-colonialism that everyone denounces.42.	My delegation believes that successful co-operation in respect of technical assistance staff depends in particular on the proper training of technical assistants who adequately fit the job description  the assignment of the technician to his post until his mission has been completed and the positive desire of the foreign technician to communicate to his opposite number the professional knowledge that he has  so that the latter can really replace him properly.43.	In concluding my statement I should like in public to pay a tribute to the various organs of the United Nations  to Member and non-member States which  in one fashion or another  have contributed or are contributing to the economic and social advancement of my country. In so doing they have correctly understood the duty of solidarity which binds all peoples together and which is the guarantee of peace and world balance."
"100",6029,"SAU",27,1972,"In the name of God  the merciful and compassionate.30.	Mr. President  it is my privilege  on behalf of my Government and delegation  to tender to you our congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.31.	I cannot let this occasion pass without expressing my deep gratification for the efficient and serene manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  conducted the work of the previous session.32.	It also is most appropriate at this juncture to greet our new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has indeed distinguished himself not only in his country but also in the international field. We sincerely wish him success in his highly responsible post  which requires constant vigilance and dedication in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.33.	Much as we welcome the relative state of detente amongst the major Powers  we remain concerned that the foreign policies of States  large and small  are still predicated upon the basis of balance of power and spheres of influence  a policy which has changed little since the founding of the United Nations. To clarify this statement  I venture to say that quite often we find that justice and equity are subordinated to paramount national interests.34.	In illustration of what I mean  I only have to cite the tragic situation in the Middle East  of which this Organization has been unremittingly seized since the right of self-determination  a corner-stone of the Charter  was flouted in 1947 and continuously thereafter.35.	The mere fact that the neighboring Arab countries became involved in the conflict brought about by hordes of immigrants of foreign national origin does not  and should not  make us forget that the indigenous people of Palestine have a distinct personality  and although many of them were dispersed outside the borders of their land  they have not for a moment lost their national identity.36.	It was to serve the interests of certain great Powers that the usurping State of Israel was created by pressure and immoral maneuvering at the second session of this same General Assembly  in 1947.37.	In this connexion I would like to recall what His Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz declared  word for word  during the 1947 session of the General Assembly:""Remember that in the preamble of the Charter you have pledged before God and history that you would stand firm against the aggressor and direct your effort to establish world peace and international security. Is not what is being attempted in Palestine a case of flagrant aggression? Is it not tyrannical that an international organization is intervening to partition a country in order to present a part of it to the aggressor? "" 38.	In spite of all this  the Charter of the United Nations was disregarded  and Palestine was partitioned by immoral and arbitrary pressure  which enabled Zionist immigrants  mostly victims of Nazi and other European persecution  to establish themselves in Palestine  thanks to the British Mandate.39.	Even the British  who pursued an equivocal policy of ""divide and rule"" during their perfidious Mandate  imposed on the Palestinians without their consent at Versailles in 1922-thereby setting aside Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations-and who were the benefactors of Zionism  were themselves the victims of Zionist terror.40.	Who murdered Lord Moyne? Who hanged British Tommies from trees in Palestine? Who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem and tried repeatedly to kill the British High Commissioner in Palestine  Sir Harold MacMichael  and succeeded in wounding him? Who murdered Count Folke Bernadotte and his French assistant in Jerusalem?41.	And have we forgotten the highly organized Zionist terrorist gangs such as the Irgun Z'vai Leumi  the Stern gang  the Haganah and other splinter terrorist organizations  acting in concert or independently?42.	And who can forget the massacre of Deir Yasin  whose population was subjected to total genocide? It was that horrible massacre which terrorized helpless people and forced them to leave their homes  thereby enabling the Zionists to establish themselves in Palestine.43.	No one  including ourselves  condones terrorism and acts of violence; nevertheless  we note that some circles believe that a people like the Palestinians  struggling for their freedom and inalienable rights  should abide by certain rules and regulations which are observed in conventional warfare. But it is precisely because the United Nations was paralyzed by Zionist arbitrary actions against the Palestinians that many of those Palestinians had no choice but to go underground to fight in a manner not dissimilar to that which had been adopted by Zionists in order to attain their goal.44.	Let me assure this Assembly that Palestinian organizations are not accountable to any Government—Arab or non-Arab and nobody can compel them to disclose their secret plans. Furthermore  the Arab Governments are not responsible for what the Palestinians have undertaken to do. Therefore  any false accusations thrown at Arab Governments of promoting Palestinian operations are  indeed  malicious in the sense that those accusations are calculated to cover extensive aggressive acts against certain Arab States.45.	I do not think that the world should forget the recent aggressive acts perpetrated against our Arab lands. I would mention the bombardment of the region of Abu Simbel in Egypt  inhabited only by civilians  and the Egyptian school in Bahr Al Baqar which was destroyed  with all its innocent children murdered. What about Zionist aggression against Beirut Airport and the destruction of all the civil aircraft there?46.	But have such treacherous acts ceased to threaten the security and stability of the region? We have only to recall the recent Zionist invasion of Lebanon  during which hundreds of innocent women and children were killed or wounded. How can we forget the continuous acts of aggression  including the usurpation of Syrian and other neighboring territories  which are still being subjected to Zionist aerial bombardment  without sparing towns  mosques  churches and even bridges which are vital for the livelihood of people dwelling in small towns and villages?And how can we forget the Holy Places  revered by hundreds of millions of Moslems and Christians as a legacy of mankind  which have been desecrated by the Zionists? All this has happened while the whole world has been aware of it but has not  however  taken the least initiative; nor do the people of the Middle East ever hear a murmur of protests about  or condemnation of  such desecrations.47.	But when a small group of individuals  driven as they are by sheer despair and bitter frustration stemming from their tragic situation  takes action against another group  the whole world is thrown into commotion and voices cry to the high heavens but no attempt is made to find out the underlying causes which led to such tragic events. Why are not similar voices raised when hundreds nay  thousands of innocent people are killed in various regions of the world as a consequence of the acts of those who seem to ignore the United Nations Charter  which was meant to bring justice and equity to all mankind without any exception?48.	It is  therefore  up to the United Nations to rectify the gross error committed in 1947  by recognizing the people of Palestine; and also  instead of mollifying the Zionists  the United Nations should bring pressure to bear on them to accept a solution which would take into account the collective will of the Palestinian people. Otherwise  there will never be peace in the Middle East and we shall witness more unnecessary suffering and tribulation. We shall witness more innocent people being sacrificed and we may possibly be confronted by a situation fraught with incalculable consequences  not precluding a global conflagration. Hence  the troubled situation in the Middle East should not be considered as arising principally from a state of war between Arab States and the Zionists; for  indeed  this troubled situation essentially emanates from the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their own homeland.49.	Let us face the facts  no matter how distressing and unfortunate those facts are. Let us not beguile ourselves by merely treating the symptoms  but let us get to the root of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts of violence which ""lie in misery  frustration  grievance and despair"" and which cause some people ""to sacrifice human lives  including their own  in an attempt to effect radical changes"" [see A/8791/Add.l]. Those are the very words of our Secretary-General  words which were endorsed by the General Assembly in including this item [item 92] in its agenda.50.	For many years now the United Nations has been dealing with several items of the utmost importance. These items have a direct bearing on the lives of millions of people around the world. In spite of the fact that the United Nations has been continuously preoccupied with such questions as disarmament  racial discrimination and the elimination of colonialism in all its forms  I submit that very -slow and limited progress has been made towards finding satisfactory solutions to most of these problems. Indeed  the world is still engaged in an unflagging armaments race and nations continue to increase their stockpiles of lethal weapons.51.	On the other hand  racial discrimination  particularly in certain parts of Africa and elsewhere  is not only rampant but unfortunately still shapes the policies of a number of Member States that more the preamble to the Charter  which decries such nefarious policies. Added to all this  some of the worst forms of colonialism are still extant in several regions of the world. It is saddening  therefore  to witness the impotence of the United Nations to uphold the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination  and to find those peoples ruled arbitrarily by an oppressive minority  as is happening in South Africa  Rhodesia  Namibia  Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).52.	Apart from all this  and in a different context  I must not forget to mention the tens of thousands of Pakistanis still languishing in Indian prisons.53.	Certain international organizations have been established with the sole purpose of ensuring the greatest possible human welfare and prosperity. Two of those organizations are the OAU and the International Islamic Organization. The purposes and principles of those organizations are in total harmony with those of the United Nations. We cannot but take pride in the leaders who participated in founding those organizations; the more so since their noble goals on both the regional and the international level fall within the framework of the United Nations Charter.54.	In this connexion  I am happy to state that the International Islamic Organization  to which I referred in my statement during the last session [1961st meeting]  consists of 32 Moslem countries. In spite of the short period since that Organization came into being  we consider its achievements to be of high historical importance and we take particular pride in the fact that it is owing to the consistent efforts of His Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz and his brethren the kings and Presidents of other Moslem States that the Organization is having such a salutary impact on the whole Moslem world.55.	In conclusion  let me assure you that the International Islamic Organization was founded with the purpose of bringing about peace  which is the essence of the sacred mission of Islam. That Organization is one of the largest in the world. Its principles are based on justice unto others and appropriate support for the right of peoples and nations to self-determination  while none the less endeavoring to raise the social and economic standard of living for Moslems and non-Moslems alike so as to include the whole of mankind.56.	It is on this basis  therefore  that we take pride in supporting the OAU in all that it is doing to establish universal peace and the type of development that will lead ultimately to world stability.57.	Finally  we express the hope that the United Nations will eventually be able to live up to the expectations of all the peoples of the world and we also sincerely hope that conditions in the world will be such as to enable this Organization to play the historic role for which it was founded."
"101",6065,"SDN",27,1972,"Mr. President  at the outset I wish to congratulate you on your assumption of the stewardship of this session of the Assembly  a responsibility upon which you have embarked with tact and dynamism. Our congratulations also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  who is approaching the close of his first full year with us. To you we pledge unfailing co-operation  to him unflinching support.74.	There have been two recurring themes in the general debate this year  terrorism and detente two seemingly irreconcilable phenomena. In this statement I wish essentially to address myself to those two questions.75.	Since the Second World War  which gave man the impetus to organize along international lines in the hope of controlling dangers to peace and security at various structural levels  the world has witnessed radical changes which have revolutionized concepts of time and space and therefore given new dimensions to the global interdependency of man. What happens in another country  even in a village of peasants  is no longer the isolated concern of those immediately involved but is the concern of all.76.	The world has also witnessed the awakening of man to Ms birth-rights and the realization by nations that no people is good enough to be another people's master.77.	But in spite of this awakening and interdependency  violence is still rending the world. This violence in the world only constitutes a small part of a much more pervasive problem of disorder resulting from human indignities and tragedies that now afflict the larger portions of mankind across the globe but which rarely find adequate representation in media that are often motivated by self-seeking ends exclusively. Indeed  only when remote problems leave a sign on our door-steps do we seem to realize that we are not on an isolated island of peace and security  that we are in the midst of a sea of human indignity  suffering and tragedy.78.	The world is plagued by terror -terror within and terror without the bounds of our countries; terror by individuals as well as terror by groups of individuals and States. Within  it is often a reaction against inequities of birth or inequalities of worth or repulsion against the moral asphyxia of a decaying civilization. Without  it is a revolt against colonial servitude  territorial aggression or national humiliation. In all those cases  terror is motivated neither by an innate disposition to violence nor by a propensity for spite. Instead it is a response to inner torments born out of inequity and frustration. In all those cases nothing is wanton. Wanton terror by individuals or groups of individuals stands condemned. At the national level it is a grievous affliction; at the international level  an unmitigated disaster. No Government that believes in a better world order and the well-being of man can wink at the former or license the latter.79.	If we are genuinely seeking to deliver mankind from violence in all its forms  we had better address ourselves not only to its consequences but also to its genesis. The failure to realize fully the interdependency of the local  national and regional interests of the world community has generally resulted in the inability of the world Organization to appreciate the root-causes of problems often grounded on the lower and intermediate levels of the world structure.80.	If we have opposed  therefore  the inclusion of this item [item 92] in the agenda of this Assembly  we have not done so because we are challenging either the initiative of the Secretary-General to deal with a universal adverse phenomenon or the duty of this Organization to handle willful actions that threaten the very fabric of civilized society. What we have wished to guard against is the exploitation of the item and the occasion by those whose convictions are suspect and whose virtue is questionable. The way in which this debate has unfolded has borne us out.81.	It is revealing that of all those that have spoken on terror the three countries that have chosen to make the subject a major theme of their statements are those that have flouted every single resolution relating to them passed by the competent organs of this Organization  including the supreme peace-making organ  the Security Council  in their efforts to establish peace and order. Need I say that the unholy trinity I am referring to is South Africa  Portugal and Israel?82.	South Africa devoted one-quarter of its statement [2046th meeting] to telling the world that terrorism derives from the rejection of dialog and must be condemned whatever the motivations leading to it. Portugal  with one-third of its statement [2048th meeting] on the subject  chose to preach to the world that no desire for justice or reform and no eagerness for liberation could justify the use of force. Israel  with over half of its statement [2045th meeting] on terrorism  tried to talk this Assembly into believing that the most rampant terror in the world today is that which has its roots in Arab hostility to Israel and that in the rest of the world all is milk and honey. It is declarations such as those that explain the position of many of us who advised caution; and it is declarations such as those that make us ask whether words really mean what they say. The term ""terrorism"" becomes overloaded. In fact it is so overloaded that it has become vacuous. Perhaps it is here that we should start: by defining the meaning of ""terrorism""  Wisdom  in the words of Socrates  begins with the definition of terms. Oratorical virtuosity  consummate fabrications and insolent demagogy cannot lead us very far.83.	Yes  let us deal with terrorism. Let us deal with it as we see it: in the pestilence of colonialism that pollutes our continent; in racialism  that defiles our societies; in the tragedies suffered by the innocent peoples of Asia  where bombardment is incessant and armies  despite all the peace overtures  are still marching on with drum and fife; in the willful attacks from the air and land on the peaceful hamlets and innocent women and children of Lebanon. The speakers who have decided to try to keep this Organization during this session in a spasm of anxiety cannot tell us that individual deaths are tragedies and mass murders are only statistics.84.	It is colonialism  racialism  territorial aggrandizement and the wanton use of force by States that are the mortal enemies of peace and the conduct of civilized human intercourse among peoples and nations.85.	In Africa  for example  if the United Nations were to be judged only on its record in questions of decolonization and racial discrimination there would be little reason for gratification over its achievements. It is now exactly 26 years since the Organization became involved with African problems  when India in 1946 raised the question of racial discrimination in South Africa.  Since then the General Assembly and the Security Council have between them passed about 130 resolutions  while the International Court of Justice has delivered not less than half a dozen opinions  all on questions of decolonization and racial discrimination in Africa. Many of those resolutions and opinions have disappeared into the morass of good ideas that ""might have been"". For all its involvement in those questions  spread over a quarter of a century  the United Nations has not been able to improve the lot of Africans and thereby halt the now accelerating drift towards a major conflict and the escalation to more violence; and the extent of this spiral is any body's guess.86.	In Rhodesia a rebellious white supremacist clique representing only 4.9 per cent of the population is growing in arrogance and reveling in repression. Its racialism is too deeply implanted to abdicate its place to charity and reason 87.	In the Portuguese Territories about one half of the still dependent 30 million people of the world live. Portugal has yet to learn that the invariable purpose of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)] was the hastening of independence.88.	All these are not isolated incidents and the United Nations has not failed to relate them to world peace and order. The Security Council and the General Assembly have since 1961 resolved that apartheid would endanger international peace and security and requested all States to consider such steps  singly or collectively  as were open to them to get South Africa to abandon its policies.89.	The United Nations has also committed itself  since 1968  to economic sanctions under Articles 42 and 43 of the Charter  having determined that the situation created by the Rhodesian rebellion ""constitutes a threat to peace"". If Africa resorts to force  as indeed it has  and with the blessing of its heads and elders who decided at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] at Rabat to double their support of the liberation movements  it is doing so only to rid the world of an affliction which is insidiously undermining civilized society and to lance a festering sore that is about to pollute its whole body.90.	In the Middle East  where territories of three Member States have been under foreign occupation for over five years  where a whole people has for nearly three decades been suffering the indignation of forced refuge  and where ceaseless bombardments are carried out on the innocent  violence also is rampant.91.	The Foreign Minister of Israel  by the prevarication of established historical facts acknowledged by this Organization and reaffirmed repeatedly by different organs  wanted to relate this violence to what he considers the villain of the play. He asked:"". .. is it true that there is a distinct people"" meaning the Palestinian people-""deprived of self-determination  languishing in poverty  squalor and humiliation  dependent on organized violence as its sole prospect of redemption? "" [2045th meeting  para. 109.]And without taking a breath Mr. Eban replied  unabashedly  to his own question: ""Nothing could be further from the truth."" [Ibid.] Here again we have an example of the futility of this debate on terror  where words mean different things to different people.92.	But we do not have to quibble with words to establish the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  their existence being a reality denied only by Mr. Eban. Mr. Eban is the last person to be unaware of the reason why the General Assembly resolution of November 1947 [resolution 181 (IIj] -to which Israel owes its very existence- was called ""the partition resolution"". Partition of what? And partition between whom?93.	This very Assembly resolved  by its resolution 194 (III)  that the Palestinians had a right to return to their homes or to be compensated if they chose not to do so. That resolution has recurred at every ensuing session. But neither repatriation nor compensation has taken place  because of Israeli intransigence  which Mr. Eban crowned last week with his negation of the very existence of the Palestinian people. Such an outlook is not conducive enough to a rational consideration of the question at issue.94.	The crowning irony comes when Israel requests this Organization to engage in a process of law-making banning international terrorism. And the irony is doubled when this request is made in the very statement telling us  in dealing with the Arab-Israeli question  that the United Nations atmosphere-and I quote Mr. Eban is hot ""congenial to the craftsmanship of peace"" [2045th meeting  para. 68]. That statement is the supreme contribution of Israel to the demise of the United Nations peace-keeping effort in the Middle East.95.	It was therefore no surprise to anybody that the Israeli statement  in addition to its disdain for all United Nations resolutions relating to the rights of the Palestinian people  was devoid of any reference to Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which the Foreign Minister of Israel himself described last year as the only basis of United Nations jurisprudence in the matter [2015th meeting]. For the rest of us  Mr. Maurice Schumann spoke lucidly and aptly when he said""... does any people or country of the Middle East not understand that for its independence to be definitively ensured it must be sheltered from the interplay of outside scheming or rivalries? To this fundamental question there can only be a definitive and sure answer here  not elsewhere"" [2041st meeting  para. 80.]96.	It takes a lot of courage for a plaintiff to come to equity while engaged in unconscionable practice  one basic maxim of the law of equity being; he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. And it takes a lot of arrogance to seek justice while showing contempt for the bench and ridiculing the jury.97.	On the same theme  the United States has come to this Assembly with a draft resolution[A/C.6/L.851]. The basic defect in that draft resolution is that it ends where it should have begun. The main point should be to urge Member States to address themselves to the sources of tension. As long as there is subjugation and inequity people will always resort to violence to reach goals that are unreachable otherwise.98.	Revolutions have never been concomitant with the sanctity of human life. This mode of social behavior is neither African nor Asian. It was the United States itself that won its independence through violence  years before Robespierre delivered to the world his dictum that in revolution ""terror is justice  prompt  secure and inflexible"" and that revolution should ""conduct people by reason and enemies of the people by terror"". And unless flagrant injustices are removed  unless gross inequities are eradicated  unless bitterness is basically extirpated from the hearts of men  the concept of people and enemies of the people will remain to be determined by subjective measuring rods depending on whom and what you relate to. And unless a better and more civilized system of world order is established  in which states breaking the law of nations are brought to account  incidents of wanton terror can neither be isolated nor adequately controlled.99.	A world organization that does not address itself to those objective realities of multiple yet interdependent and interactive dimensions is likely to be fragmented and preoccupied with the visible manifestations of problems on the international level  while leaving their root-causes embedded in the deceptively remote and even isolated national or regional corners of foreign lands. Such an organization will be not only ineffective  but indeed shaken by the undercurrents of frustrations and discontent in those remote corners.100.	the phenomena of violence as a mode of expressing a grievance or rebelling against an injustice  and that of detente as an outcome of new alignments among States  are not necessarily paradoxical. The dynamics of human endeavor are now revealing new trends of realignment in search of alternative methods of tackling problems. We are witnessing a narrowing gulf between the big Powers in their attempt to solve their problems and promote their mutual national or regional interests  thus averting violence on their soil while continuing it  by proxy  on foreign soil. In other words  violence is being exported to us.101.	Detente and the composition of differences are welcome as long as they do not reflect a preoccupation with problems of immediate national interest  to the exclusion of international problems  or degenerate into a conspiracy of silence. The absence of a single reference to Africa in the Moscow Declaration that mapped out all the problem areas of the world is an example of the former. The irrational position of some western Powers on the issue of Rhodesia in the Security Council is an example of the latter.102.	On the other hand  new alignments among the small Powers are taking place; old ones are being reinforced. The Rabat meeting of the African Heads of State and Government and the Georgetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  and their outcome  are reflections of this trend. In so far as those meetings are focusing on regional or selected international problems  where the minds are at one  the trend is positive and promising. But in so far as the trend is founded on the failure of the international Organization to solve problems  it is disconcerting.	103.	The new alignments and international syndicalism are duly leading to what the Foreign Minister of Brazil has aptly described  in his open statement here as the ""diplomatic marginalization of the United Nations"" [2038th meeting  para. 33]. Some of us might be deluded into thinking that our salvation is in clubbism and interdependency of interests.104.	But interdependency of interests implies more than building policies on competitive interaction and interdependence. It requires positive co-operation towards the achievement of the common goal of human dignity in all aspects of life. It requires the global sharing of power  of material wealth  of spiritual well-being and of scientific and technological advantages. And all this requires a change in the fundamental chemistry of international relations.105.	But in all this where does the United Nations come in? The Georgetown Conference  whose final Act is now in the hands of the Secretary-General  precisely addressed itself to this question. We have all reaffirmed our faith in the Charter of the United Nations  but the Charter is not a fetish. And we have all pledged our support to the Organization  but the Organization will have to change with time. We have all called for the democratization as well as the increased universalization of the United Nations. China is now in our midst and we are the richer by its presence.106.	Institutions  like men  grow and become obsolescent. Change is imperative if there is to be a new international order based on justice and fair play; it is only the dead who do not change. To achieve this goal  some modification of the Charter and review of the role of various organs are indispensable.107.	The process is not unknown to the United Nations. Amendments have been introduced to the Charter. Less dramatic  but equally important  is the evolution of the Charter provisions through the various liberal and creative interpretations given to them. The Charter  like all living constitutions  was meant to be adaptive and self-regulating.108.	Such an endeavor must be undertaken with both imagination and realism. And realism might lead us to accept  but not become resigned to  certain facts of life. Article 2  paragraph 7 and Article 27 of the Charter  lead together  teach us that there is a two-tier concept of equality. What is to be challenged  therefore  is not the weighted power of some States  inherent in the Charter  as much as the wanton exercise of such power. Power is to be disciplined and its exercise civilized  for  when power is unguided by enlightened principle and high purpose  it can only spell disaster in the end.109.	I have alluded to regional realignments and endeavors which are motivated by the desire of nations and regional organizations to tackle their immediate problems  thus enabling them to come to grips with their own urgent needs. Such alignments may frustrate international cooperation in the tackling of political  economic  social and cultural problems.110.	Fortunately this is not invariably the case. We in the Sudan do not boast of any achievements in this field but we have an experience which  though local  is a microcosm of many problems now faced in many parts of the world. The co-operation we have received from various friendly Governments  the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as well as from voluntary organizations  also testifies to the significance of our example as a microcosm of world problems and the potentialities of co-operation in their solution at all levels. 111.	The case in point is our solution to a national problem which has afflicted our country with civil strife 17 years old-which cost us many lives  frustrated our development and fostered resentment and bitterness instead of solidarity and patriotism among brothers and sisters. The so-called Arab North and African South of our country are one people with a lot more in common than the world has heard  but the legacy of colonial isolationist and divisive policies left deep gulf that erupted into hostilities which the successive Governments tried-some genuinely and some half-heartedly-to end  without avail.112.	Our Government realized that the common good of the nation was interdependent with the interests of all its citizens as reflected in their sharing in political power and in the advantages of the economic  social and cultural development of their region. By formulating and implementing a system of regional autonomy  the Government met the political aspirations of the people of the South and has now embarked on an extensive program of immediate relief  resettlement  and rehabilitation of refugees and returnees.113.	The refugee example is noteworthy because it is unprecedented. For over half a century  since Fridtjof Nansen embarked on the first international refugee program  problems of refugees were solved through either their assimilation in host countries or their return to their homes following military victory. This is the first time in the history of international refugee efforts when refugees  hundreds of thousands of them  are returning to their homes both peaceably and voluntarily  out of their own accord and volition.114.	The international dimension of the Sudanese experience is evident not only in our accommodation of multiplicity and diversity within unity and community of interest  but also in the co-operation and assistance we have received from the outside world-co-operation and assistance from sister countries  joined to us by bonds of brotherhood  and a world family that saw in our experience a fresh breath of sanity.115.	And now  with peace restored  we cannot fail to address ourselves to the other phase of peace-making: social and economic development. Peace and security cannot be fragmented into political  economic  social or cultural components in the vain hope of solving the one without tackling the other. Development is a precondition for stability and expansion and a fundamental prerequisite for international peace and security. As such  the development of the proletarian nations of the world is an international responsibility as well as a national one. The very philosophy underlying the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] stems from the awareness that the international community has a global responsibility for the solution of social and economic problems.116.	Our economic and social development is keeping pace neither with our own needs nor with the growth of world trade and development. The results are wide-spread poverty  endemic malnutrition and inadequate education.117.	The present international economic order may not be capable of accommodating the needs and expectations of the developing world  whether because of the wasteful distortion of priorities  the widening gap between the national interests of the affluent and those of the have-nots  or the absence of generally accepted norms. To those questions and others we shall devote our efforts in the appropriate Committee of this Assembly.118.	For many of us this year is the year of the environment. It is the year of man's unity with nature. However  there is an irony in this situation which did not escape the attention of my learned friend the Foreign Minister of Guyana. He said:""... it would be futile to develop a planetary strategy based on the unity of man with other life forms while ignoring those factors of inequality that frustrate and destroy the unity of mankind  and those realities of tension and conflict that impair the quality and threaten the existence of human life itself..."" [2038th meeting  para. 110.]119.	The irony is supreme. But  despite all the alarms on violence and terror as well as all the frustrations and desperations of the afflicted  we cannot but continue our pilgrim's progress. The United Nations will have no choice but to devote all its efforts to those human tragedies that are still awaiting their catharsis.120.	To that end the Sudan pledges its support to the Organization  which remains  despite all its failings  the abiding corner-stone of world peace and stability as well as of the well-being of man."
"102",6111,"SEN",27,1972,"Mr. President  I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity today to associate myself with the speakers who have preceded me in offering to you the warmest congratulations of my delegation and expressing to you our deep satisfaction at seeing an eminent representative of Eastern Europe  ardent defender  moreover  of the cause of oppressed peoples  presiding over the destinies of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly.129.	I also wish  in accordance with the traditions of equity of this august Assembly  to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik for the tact and competence that he displayed during the work-which is now history-of the last session of the General Assembly  work to which he brought so much intelligence and nobility of spirit.130.	To our Secretary-General I wish to express the gratification of my delegation for his excellent introduction to the work of the present session. Since his election to his responsible post he has continued to show the measure of his authority and his competence in the face of the important affairs of a world in a constant state of flux.131.	Today we are gathered in a climate which is propitious for fundamental changes  harbingers of a new era in international relations. The most striking illustration of this radical transformation in international order is surely to be found in the following significant events: the Sino-American rapprochement  which took the form of an official trip by President Nixon to China; the determination proclaimed by the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul to promote the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea; the equally evident will of the two German States to modify their fundamental relationships; the prospect for detente in Indo-Pakistani relations as a result of the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 and subsequent talks; and the determination of Japan and China to normalize their relations.132.	It is nevertheless essential in this ever-changing world whose transformations are frequently beyond our understanding that we not let ourselves be carried away by the illusion of apparent security.133.	It is evident that the most cynical person would be unable to deliver a speech on the state of the world  which we are invited to do at the annual session of the General Assembly  without expressing a feeling of profound misgiving at the growing gap between the noble ideals set for itself by the international community and the melancholy reality. To ensure peace among States  to induce respect for the sovereignty of the weak against the strong through respect for international law  which is the guarantor of freedom for peoples and men: is that not a grandiose task in defense of which all countries should be mobilized?134.	And yet what do we see from continent to continent? Everywhere conflicts are breaking out. Numerous bombings with their aftermath of iron  fire and blood still ravage various points on our planet. Millions of innocent victims are dressing their wounds when they are not weeping for their dead. Others continue to live in dreadful poverty  condemned  most frequently  to the darkness of colonial servitude.135.	These atrocities and I am not saying anything that is not already well known affect by some irony of fate the countries of the third world  those very countries which are trying to achieve stability and peace in order to ensure their material and moral development. Were we to stop to meditate on this depressing situation we would become bitterly aware of the nefarious role played in the world by selfishness and the Wish for power of one or the other of the great Powers even though they claim to belong to different ideologies.136.	That is why it is already high time to address an urgent appeal to all peoples and men of goodwill to join their energies and bend all their will towards the achievement of justice and peace in the world.137.	In formulating that wish I must turn my eyes towards the ancient continent of Asia  from which so many messages of peace emanated  but which today offers the distressing spectacle of one of the most horrible human tragedies: I refer to the War in IndoChina.138.	The VietNamese people  tragically torn asunder by a horrible fratricidal war of 20 years duration  have undeniably shown to South-East Asia a spirit of determination and sacrifice  until now unsuspected. Because their thirst for freedom and their refusal to capitulate has surely converted the VietNamese conflict into the martyrdom of an entire people  it appears to us that there  as elsewhere  negotiation remains the Only course towards a constructive peace  since it would be freely consented to. Without further delay the United Nations must echo the words of President Senghor  who stated recently:""It is time for weapons to be silent in VietNam as well as in the Middle East so that a just and durable peace may come  based upon the self-determination of peoples  without foreign intervention.""This is the prior condition whose realization would make it possible for the Paris conference to embark resolutely upon a decisive course with increased chances of success.139.	It is also the moment for our Organization in this respect following the clearly expressed will of the George-town Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries to re-establish as a full pledged Member of the United Nations the regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia  which not often is recognized by the majority of members of the international community but  above all  controls more than 85 per cent of the national territory  which to this day harbors more than 11 members of the Government.140.	I do not doubt  in the light of events which have taken place recently  that we may at last be on the eve of seeing  if not an era of peace  at least a certain era of calm in South-East Asia  a region that has long been sorely tried.141.	May the hope for the Far East extend also to the Middle East. As President Senghor has indicated  the painful Israel-Arab struggle amounts to a fratricidal struggle between two branches of the great Semitic family  which has given to the world irreplaceable messages. Suddenly  the unprecedented actions of the ""10 wise men"" of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  with a view to Ambassador Jarring resuming negotiations  take on a special significance.142.	Unfortunately  the policies of certain great Powers  which seem to accommodate themselves to the proposition of ""no peace  no war"" in the Middle East  seem  in all likelihood  to spell ultimate ruin for the efforts of the OAU. However  far from despairing of peace in the Middle East  the countries of the third world and also  and especially  the great Powers of the European Economic Community are duty-bound to redouble their efforts towards a prompt settlement of the conflict  a settlement which would be in accord with their interests  especially since the two belligerent Powers are associate members of the Common Market.143.	Just as my Government has maintained and still maintains that there are truths and realities imposed by reason  and the existence of Israel is just such a reality  it is also convinced that the security of the Jewish State will not be ensured in the long run except through dialog and agreement with its Arab neighbors the latter having to realize that peace is more than ever necessary to their unity and development. It is therefore pertinent that the advent of peace to the area depends exclusively on a dialog between Moslems  Jews  Arabs and Bedouins.144.	Accordingly  it is now for the United Nations to require that Israel establish the conditions necessary for such a dialog through strict compliance with and full application of the pertinent provisions of Security Council resolution 242(1967)  and that it publicly declare at the same time its intention not to annex occupied Arab territories. That would be a decisive step for Israel that would lead to the negotiating table  Egypt no longer being able  at the risk of losing its territorial integrity and identity  to make any further concessions.145.	In referring to this gloomy picture of the Middle East we have to recall  in the case of international terrorism  which everybody agrees must be denounced as a threat to peace  that it is a constant truth that to be radical the eradication of any evil necessarily requires a thorough knowledge of its profound causes.146.	To my delegation it is important first of all to define clearly what is meant by the word ""terrorism"" and to study all its aspects  including the underlying motivations which engender terror throughout the world  before seeking to determine subsequently forceful measures that might eliminate it as a means of action in conflicts between States. I emphasize  moreover  that my country will oppose in the most categorical fashion any Initiative to put the slightest impediment in the way of the noble and just liberation movements that are operating on the African continent.147.	There is a problem of as much concern as that of the Middle East. I am referring to the problem of colonialism  which imperils peace and security throughout the world. Decolonization in other words  the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination constitutes  as we know  the most sacred foundation of the United Nations family. This is a fundamental rule an embodiment of the chief safeguard of human rights which  for every government worthy of the name  must guarantee the certainty of peace.148.	How  therefore  can we endure Africa's continuing to pay a heavy tribute to this phenomenon of decolonization? How can we endure that Portugal  South Africa and the illegal and racist regime in Southern Rhodesia continue with impunity to keep millions of human beings in the fetters of colonial oppression and thereby violate in the most flagrant way fundamental human rights?149.	In Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau)  Portugal  for the past 10 years  has been pursuing an archaic war of colonial reconquest. Although condemned many times by the Security Council following repeated complaints from African States bordering the Territories under Portuguese administration  the Lisbon authorities have nevertheless shown their determination to be sucked into the quicksand of armed aggression and provocation. In spite of everything my Government  which has welcomed 80 000 refugees from Guinea (Bissau) to its territory  would be prepared to believe that Portugal is not racist  but the logical conclusion of such an absence of prejudice would be  indeed  respect for and strict application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contained in resolution 1514 (XV).150.	In Southern Rhodesia the minority  illegal and racist regime is still in power seven years after the unilateral and illegal declaration of independence and two years after the proclamation of the no less illegal ""republic"". That rebel regime grows stronger every day in spite of the mandatory economic sanctions dictated by the United Nations  particularly by the Security Council. It is true that  contrary to expectations  those sanctions have not had a decisive effect on the economic situation in Southern Rhodesia and therefore do not seem capable of producing the expected political changes  bearing in mind the assistance that South Africa is giving to the rebel colony.151.	Only a few days ago  under the shallow pretext of the effect it was having on ""Olympic peace""  the blacks of all continents were unjustly made the object of vituperation worse  they were denied some of their victories in the competitions by a fierce coalition of whites of all convictions unable to accept the unanimous will of Africa to oppose Rhodesian participation in the Olympic Games. We must proclaim to all those who  under the cloak of political disinterestedness  continue to deny the valiant people of Zimbabwe its right to human dignity that it is precisely their unshakable readiness to recognize a white minority domination of millions of blacks that indubitably constitutes the most monstrous political act  since it is dictated solely by racist concerns.152.	Everyone knows that what we are witnessing on the part of the illegal Ian Smith regime at present is a total and systematic rejection of all preexisting values and hence the acme of mental aberration demonstrated by its unrestrained and uncontrolled use of the one form of total non-existence available to man violent death.153.	That is why  following the recent resounding rejection by the people of the ""test of acceptability"" submitted by the Pearce Commission  it is essential  in order to put a final end to the Salisbury rebellion  to resort immediately to the sort of prompt and energetic action which so serious a situation demands  in conformity with Chapter VII of the Charter. It goes without saying that Great Britain  in view of its responsibility for that Territory  must give active support to such action by displaying henceforth greater authority and determination in the exercise of its prerogatives as administering Power.154.	In South Africa and this is obvious the measures prescribed by the United Nations have not been successful either in ending the fierce repression of the innocent population or in wiping out or eliminating apartheid  which is nothing but a complete ideology of rules and constraints erected by a white minority in order to dominate and exploit the Africans. It seems to me unnecessary to refer to the case of Namibia  whose Territory has been illegally occupied by the Government of South Africa for the past six years in defiance of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  as well as the opinion of the International Court of Justice.155.	But there is something even more serious. For several years we have seen the strengthening of the Lisbon- Salisbury-Pretoria axis. The most salient features of the strengthening of that unholy alliance undoubtedly find their most sinister expression in the political  military and financial support which that trio of colonial oppressors is getting from certain members of NATO.156.	Nevertheless  the international crises of the moment should not cause us to overlook the agonizing question of economic under-development  which is the principal characteristic of three quarters of mankind. As President Senghor mentioned in his famous speech at the fifty-sixth session of the general conference of the International Labor Organization  ""a just and enduring world peace cannot be built on social injustice any more than on disregard of the ideals of the essential solidarity which must unite mankind"". 157.	For the Chief of State of Senegal  among the problems which confront the third world  problems which are dialectically connected  there is one of capital importance and that is the problem of the deterioration of the terms of trade-of the more equitable distribution of the world's wealth  three quarters of which are unjustly confiscated by the rich nations for their own benefit.158.	""The imperialism of ideology""  to use the words of the most authoritative voice in Senegal  is precisely this economy of concerted domination practiced by the great Powers to the detriment of the developing countries.159.	That is why the year which has elapsed  far from revealing any favorable prospects  has on the contrary been a disappointment for the poor countries and thereby for the whole world. The clearest and most recent proof of this dramatic situation is undoubtedly the failure of the third session of UNCTAD held in Santiago  Chile.160.	My delegation has the deep-rooted belief that the failure in Santiago had only one cause-the total absence of political will among the wealthy countries. It is no longer a secret to anyone that  as was stated at the end of the work of the second session of UNCTAD by the eminent economist Raoul Prebisch: the developed countries  with a few exceptions  continue to consider the problem of development to be a secondary problem which can be solved here and there by means of a few inadequate measures and not by bold and resolute action.161.	The verdict on Santiago will have the rare merit of highlighting what  after all  has now become obvious to all. I am speaking of the refusal of the developed countries  be they capitalist or socialist  to accept precise commitments toward the third world.162.	Indeed  no specific agreement can be achieved on improving the terms of development financing  extrication from over-indebtedness and the rules to be established to reduce the harm suffered by the developing countries as a result of the international monetary crisis. The major preoccupation of the Group of 77 developing countries with finding a solution to the tragic commodity crisis through the regulation of production and the stabilization of prices has hardly fared any better.163.	As regards the legitimate claims of the third world for partial disarmament to help development or even the establishment of an automatic link between special drawing rights and assistance to the third world  there again we are bound to record the negative-balance balance-sheet of the work of the third session of UNCTAD.164.	Here we must refer to the appeal for human solidarity launched from this rostrum by the Prime Minister of Senegal on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:""... in the present state of disharmony in the world  what better activity could the rich countries undertake than to promote the development of the poor countries? "" [1872nd meeting  para. 156.]165.	And President Senghor reiterated forcefully:""It is the duty and in the interests of the rich nations  in order to spare an anguished world a world war in which the proletarian countries  pushed to despair  will have nothing further to lose and nothing to hope for  to put into practice without delay a new strategy for the creation of a new system of trade which will be truly international-that is to say  more ecumenical-more human because more just. That strategy must be adequate for the planet and the universal civilization which we are building.""166.	Does that mean that  faced with the distressing spectacle of impoverishment in the midst of abundance  we.the have-not countries  are irremediably doomed to suffer the fate of Tantalus? Must we therefore give way to despair and seek refuge in total resignation? Of course not.167.	My delegation considers that the feelings of frustration born of the third session of UNCTAD must give way  for the rich and poor alike  to an attempt at objective thought and analysis in order to bring about genuine peace  genuine because it would be the fruit of freedom  harmonization and solidarity among all men in all continents.168.	I can assure members that  to the reasons for discouragement systematically maintained by the rich countries  the poorer countries will respond with courage  an awareness that they must stick together in order to integrate their economies rationally within regional and subregional structures  such as the recent inception of the future economic community of West Africa  to the formation of which my country is proud to have made its modest contribution.169.	Senegal remains confident in the great possibilities of the international community  which  properly combined  would contribute  sooner or later  to the establishment of a better world whose common denominator would be a fair and healthy distribution of wealth. We are all the more convinced of the truth of this  as it is not mere lip-service to tradition which makes us survey the gloomy panorama of the international situation in order to find in it some brighter spots which might notwithstanding provide  if not grounds for satisfaction  at least reasons for hope.170.	In the political and strategic field  the slight but nevertheless reassuring detente in international relations appears already as an encouraging sign. Suffice it for me simply to refer to the policy of contacts and negotiations practiced in Europe and concretely illustrated by the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Moreover  my Government has not failed to interpret the resumption of Sino-American dialog and the Moscow agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union as the prelude to an era of peaceful coexistence between the three giants of this world.171.	With regard to decolonization  while little progress has been achieved  the meetings of the Security Council in Addis Ababa have nevertheless made it possible for our young countries to refer again  but on African soil  to the bulky file on colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid. Senegal is particularly gratified since  during the Rabat meeting the Heads of State and Government of the OAU resolved to increase considerably the budget of the Committee of Liberation  and to give priority to aid and effective support for the liberation movements.172.	In the economic and social fields my delegation takes note of the few positive decisions taken by UNCTAD at its third session: those concerning the idea of having developing countries participate in the reform of the monetary system and the special program of action to be launched for the benefit of the nucleus of the 25 least developed countries.173.	I would add that it is first and foremost for the industrialized countries  which are those deriving the principal-I might say ""the exclusive"" benefit from the iniquitous rules governing the international economy  to shape the priority requirements of development to fit a world-wide context. In so doing they would respond to the appeal of the Prime Minister of Senegal  who said:""No man should feel happy as long as a single man elsewhere is dying of hunger. No nation can consider that development problems are solved  when other nations are exposed to poverty and misery."" [1872nd meeting  para. 145.]174.	Therefore  we should  in listing the possible sources of development capital  mention the need to re-channel the $200 000 million annually tossed into the unproductive and bottomless pit of the arms race.175.	Might we recall that some 20 years ago it was proclaimed necessary to establish a link  for the first time  between development and disarmament? Will the time come when our Organization will be able to address to the military Powers a more urgent and more convincing message than our customary resolutions?176.	This ideal of disarmament is undoubtedly beginning to find expression in the reduction of certain military budgets and  as a minimum  in ""non-armament"". Nevertheless  we have not yet seen international economic co-operation being enriched by the redeployment of the resources thus liberated. Is this not a symptom of a real weakness in the tissue of international relations that an obligation that is so frequently reaffirmed nevertheless finds no place in the list of priorities?177.	Moreover  we can see in the distance new tasks which can only be fulfilled if even profounder transformations take place in international life  in legal rules and in new international machinery.178.	These new requirements postulate the protection of the environment  the organization of atmospheric space and the ocean depths  the internationalization of science and the control of technological evolution  all new problems and phenomena recently brought to light at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm.179.	These various transformations do not demand that nations forfeit one jot of their sovereignty; they simply suggest a slight modification of the international division of labor.180.	We remain convinced that a harmonious combination of all these facts will definitely make it possible  in the course of the present decade  to use the full potential of the beneficial influence which the United Nations system can have on promoting human dignity. Will the world then be closer to achieving the rightful aspirations of peoples to freedom  justice and peace?181.	May our work express better than at previous sessions of the General Assembly this truth that the way towards justice and peace passes nolens volens through the harmonious and conflict-free development of nations and  therefore  through the total development of man."
"103",6157,"SGP",27,1972,"Mr. President  first of all may I  on behalf of my Government and of my delegation  extend our felicitations to you on your being elected President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly? We would also like to associate ourselves with the tributes paid to you by the many distinguished speakers who have preceded me. Permit me also to express my delegation's appreciation of the exemplary manner in which your predecessor  the distinguished Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Mr. Adam Malik  presided over the twenty-sixth session last year.28.	I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome our new Secretary-General. His ability  his wide knowledge of the ways of men and nations  and his fortitude will  I feel  be put to the severest test that any Secretary-General has yet undergone. This is because he is taking over an organization which is sick and enfeebled. The period between the last session and the present one has revealed in a striking fashion the Organization's weaknesses and failures in shaping and guiding the collective destiny of mankind.29.	The world witnessed during this period what could be described as the unkindest cut ever delivered to the United Nations. Great Powers and smaller nations discovered that complex and delicate international issues could be more expeditiously and satisfactorily settled outside this Organization through bilateral discussions rather than within it.30.	The first of these events was the resolution outside the United Nations of the seemingly irreconcilable differences which had existed between the United States and the People's Republic of China and which for a quarter of a century had been a source of international tensions and threats to peace. In the shape of the Taiwan issue it was for two decades debated inconclusively in the United Nations. Each debate left behind an accumulating residue of enmity and factionalism within the United Nations  which ensured that the next debate would be more sterile than the preceding one.31.	But now American-Chinese relations have been put on a more rational basis  not through the efforts of the United Nations  but in spite of them. Last year the President of the United States  following a series of bilateral discussions outside the United Nations  went to China and had direct talks with the Chinese leaders. At these talks both countries stated their areas of agreement and disagreement in language calculated to encourage further accord. This language was shom of all the polemics and posturing that had been depressing features of speeches and resolutions on the China issue in our Organization.32.	The second occasion when the United Nations was by-passed was the summit meeting between the President of the United States and the leaders of the Soviet Union. This resulted in a joint communique as well as a declaration of basic principles which stressed that""Differences in ideology and in the social systems of the USA and the USSR are not obstacles to the bilateral development of normal relations.. ."".Here again what is worthy of note  apart from the reference to bilateral developments  is the tone of the speeches and declarations. They convey attitudes not of challenge and antagonism but of accommodation and conciliation.33.	The third instance of the by-passing of the United Nations was the signing of the Simla Agreement between the leaders of India and Pakistan. Here again what is noticeable in speeches and statements is the absence of polemics and antagonism.34.	The bilateral accord reached between the People's Republic of China and Japan in Peking on 29 September 1972 is yet another instance of differences being resolved independently of the United Nations.35.	The divided States of Korea and Germany are making progress towards rapprochement outside the framework of the United Nations. Another outstanding issue  the tragic and protracted conflict in Viet-Nam  given present indications  is more likely to be settled outside the United Nations than within it.36.	Those instances of the by-passing of the United Nations have profound implications for our Organization. As far back as 1969 [1782nd meetingJ my delegation drew the attention of this Assembly to the separate decision-making network the big Powers were erecting to by-pass this Organization. What my delegation did not then foresee was that small nations too would by-pass the United Nations to resolve differences and conflicts. The Secretary- General is sufficiently struck by this development to draw our attention to it in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. He makes this appeal:""... But when long-standing conflicts create vast humanitarian problems and may affect the peace and security of all mankind  the United Nations should surely be involved in the attempt to settle them."" [A/87011 Add.l  p. 4. JIn saying that  the Secretary-General was not expressly referring to developments of the past year. However  he clearly had these developments in mind when making his observations. All these admittedly hopeful events occurred in contexts quite divorced from this Organization  its personnel  facilities  debates and resolutions.37.	All this is not to suggest that we should deplore settlements outside the framework of the United Nations. On the contrary  we should welcome any easing of tension and resolution of conflicts  however reached. The point I want to make is that  if the trends I have drawn attention to persist  then the United Nations could become a meaningless and irrelevant organization-no more than an international social club for wearisome rhetoric.38.	In this connexion I should like to draw the attention of representatives to Article 1 of the Charter  which proclaims that one of the purposes of the United Nations is ""to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends"".39.	The unpleasant fact we have to face is that after 27 years the United Nations is less and less a ""center"" for harmonizing the actions of nations. The time has therefore come for us to begin the unpleasant task of searching out the reasons for the growing lack of confidence in the efficacy of the United Nations and for its declining prestige.40.	There is  as in all great and complex problems  more than one cause. There are the external factors  such as the conviction of the big Powers that world diplomacy should be equated with big-Power diplomacy. The interests and ambitions of the big Powers cannot  they feel  be promoted and safeguarded by striving to get a consensus among some 130 Members  with interests and conflicts which the great Powers find not only irrelevant and tiresome but also increasingly dangerous to big-Power accord. It is not an accident that the drift towards an independent big-Power diplomacy began with the accelerated increase in the membership of the United Nations and with the tacit agreement that war between major Powers must be avoided at all costs because it implied mutual annihilation. Discussions and consultations with some 130 nations would not  the big Powers felt  promote their somewhat different interests. Big-Power problems could  it was felt  be more expeditiously and satisfactorily resolved in face-to-face discussions  unhampered by the importunities of a host of small nations. In so far as the major Powers show any interest in the United Nations  it is to regard it more as a forum for scoring propaganda points and to use smaller nations as pressure groups to influence their rivals. The United Nations  in other words  is for the big Powers a supplementary but subsidiary instrument of diplomacy. If they cannot resolve their problems through the United Nations  there ii always face-to-face diplomacy to fall back on.41.	The unpleasant fact that the small nations must face up to is that the great Powers do not need the United Nations for their diplomacy or the influencing of world affairs as much as small nations do. The big Powers have over the years established an international network of their own which  if the small nations are not careful  will increasingly shape the course of world events independently of the small nations. It is we  the small nations  rather than the great Powers  who stand to lose in the long run by the diminishing role assigned to the United Nations in the making of world history. The United Nations activities could  given present trends  be no more than foot-notes to the chapters the great Powers will write.42.	Without the United Nations there is no way in which the small nations can exert direct influence on the course of world history. In the early days of the United Nations  when the great Powers treated it as an important instrument of diplomacy  the smaller nations did play a not unimportant role in the shaping of international events. The aspirations and views of the third world nations did in some measure influence the policies and attitudes of the major Powers. The small nations were wooed with an ardor and a persistence which many small nations found satisfying. The great Powers valued  if not our views  at least our votes  because at that time  at the height of the cold war  they set great store by the resolutions approved in this Assembly. But now that the United Nations has been relegated to a position of relative unimportance by the great Powers we  the small nations  run the danger of being deprived of a very important instrument that we have for shaping and influencing major decisions on world affairs.43.	It is all too easy to cast the blame for the by-passing of the United Nations wholly on the selfishness and arrogance of the great Powers. They have their faults. Their wrangling and posturing to further the ends of the cold war undoubtedly contributed a great deal to the decline of the United Nations.44.	But the small nations  too  with their wrangling and posturing  have contributed as much to the decline of the world Organization; and if we  the small nations  want to restore vigor to the United Nations-as we must if we are to play any kind of role in world affairs then we must look at our shortcomings with a frank and critical eye. We must do so because not only is the United Nations being by-passed by the big Powers but it is also. as I have said  being by-passed by smaller nations. Like the big Powers  the small nations  too  are slowly veering to the view that the United Nations is not an organization which can be relied upon to resolve their conflicts  to solve their problems.45.	One reason is that the United Nations has tended over the years to become less and less an organization for reconciliation and more and more an arena for staging contests. That is reflected in the style and temper of many United Nations debates and resolutions. Instead of ad-dressing ourselves to finding practical solutions to difficult and complex problems we give ourselves over to polemics and rhetoric. The object is to whip up strong emotions  affix blame to one side or the other and compose resolutions around such all-too-familiar words as ""condemn""  ""deplore""  ""censure"" and ""expel"". This is not to deny the sincerity behind these great emotions or that the felt outrage is justified. Transgressions of principles basic to our Organization  such as forcible conquest and occupation of other peoples' territories or racial segregation and oppression  must clearly be condemned; nor can there be peaceful solutions to conflicts arising from such transgressions so long as the transgressors refuse to admit that basic principles have been breached.46.	But if the intention is conciliation  concession and problem-solving  then the polemical approach-the arena atmosphere will hardly accomplish any of these things. That is why earlier in my address I drew attention to the literary style of communiques and statements that preface successful bilateral discussions: they are invariably barren of polemics. Even when they testify to disagreement  they avoid apportioning blame. They see their problems and disagreements not in black-and-white but in shades of grey. The language of conciliation  of the problem-solver  has to be publicly expressed in shades of grey  whatever our perception of them may be in private.47.	That is not to say that we should not clearly enunciate our disagreements and the nature of our disagreements. But in situations of crisis and conflict  rhetoric and polemics  far from reducing tensions  make positions rigid  especially when uttered publicly to provoke and humiliate an adversary. Under these conditions  compromises and concessions become well-nigh impossible because  against the backdrop of polemics  concessions and compromises become humiliating defeats.48.	The situation is aggravated by the curious expectation in this Organization that countries not directly or even indirectly involved in a conflict should line up on one side or the other. This expectation is based on the premise that friends should prove their friendship by making enemies of their friend's enemies.49.	The consequence is that a conflict between two Members is  over a period of time  transformed into a generalized conflict involving many more Members of our Organization. The interested bystanders  instead of helping to resolve the conflict  themselves become contestants. That is one reason why many issues that come up before our Organization remain unresolved year after year. Where initially the parties to a dispute are few  it becomes unwieldy through the accretion of fresh partisans  resulting very often in everyone losing sight of the initial causes of the dispute.50.	This may explain why some of the issues that have haunted this Assembly for decades have been more satisfactorily resolved through direct negotiations between the original parties to the dispute. Presumably in bilateral discussions the initial causes of the dispute are recollected in relative tranquility.51.	Another reason for the success of bilateral discussions is that for the most part they take place in private. Unfortunately  most of the proceedings in the United Nations not only have the atmosphere of an arena  but they are also public. We perform not only for the home audience but for a world audience as well. We believe that what we say and do is being eagerly followed by the press  television and radio the world over. This may have been the case once  but it is my impression that in recent years the publicity media too have grown weary of us.52.	This is not to advocate that all proceedings of this Organization should be behind closed doors. However  this Organization should give serious consideration to supplementing public discussions with more private and closed- door discussions  especially in regard to issues of great delicacy involving profound emotions and what the Asians call ""face"". For example  my delegation would not object if the Security Council were to attempt to resolve sensitive problems without formal open sessions through informal consultations with interested parties. This is preferable to protracted meetings where no solutions are arrived at because sometimes the purpose of the Council is to decide who is innocent and who is guilty.53.	The gist of my plea is that the United Nations should become less of an arena for public contests and more of an Organization for smoothing out conflicts  for reconciling differences. The relative success of recent bilateral discussions holds an important lesson for our Organization. It is that we should inject into our Organization the spirit as well as the techniques successfully employed in bilateral negotiations. Such negotiations are private  they are informal; the participants go there not to decide who is guilty and who is innocent  but to reach accord while containing differences.54.	I am not saying that this approach will resolve the many and difficult problems that confront our Organization. There are no simple and quick remedies to many of our problems. All I am saying is that  so long as most of us view the United Nations as an arena for dramatic contests  there is very little chance of our being able to restore to the United Nations the vigor and prestige which it deserves.55.	Maybe it is not the United Nations which needs to be reinvigorated and nursed to health. It may well be that we have got the United Nations we deserve. For the United Nations has no existence outside of the Members that constitute it. The United Nations is no more than a mirror reflecting the collective weaknesses and defects of us all.56.	Outside of us the United Nations is nothing. Without the United Nations we  the small nations  may be nothing too in the drama of world politics."
"104",6237,"SLE",27,1972,"Mr. President  permit me to congratulate you on your assumption of the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session. I wish you every success in steering the deliberations of this august Assembly.131.	May I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  for the efficient manner in which he chaired the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly when discussions of far-reaching importance to this Organization were undertaken.132.	It is now nearly a year since the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  assumed his duties. At that time we expressed to him the best wishes of the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone [2031st meeting]. I wish to commend him for his achievements over the past nine months. Very soon after assuming office  the Secretary- General made historic visits to various parts of the world  including Africa. He met and exchanged views with heads of State and government and foreign ministers. We are confident that during his tenure of office he will raise aloft the high ideals of the United Nations.133.	We congratulate him in particular for having succeeded in persuading the racist regime of South Africa to permit an officer of the United Nations to enter Namibia in order to investigate in great detail the political situation in that Territory with the ultimate aim of granting it independence. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank him and his staff for the report they have submitted on this question. 134.	May I take this opportunity to report that our new Republic  under the Presidency of His Excellency Mr. Siaka Stevens  has definitely brought progress  order and stability to Sierra Leone. We look forward to renewing our efforts to strive together with the international community for the further development of peace and progress on earth.135.	Let me now highlight a number of matters which may be deliberated during this session of the General Assembly and which reflect certain aspects of Sierra Leone's foreign policy.136.	My Government stands firmly committed to the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ  which enters into its second decade next year. The OAU has developed into a strong institution  capable not only of harmonizing the views of different African States but also of solving the difficulties which may from time to time occur among its members.137.	In Africa we are plagued with different forms of imperialism which we can no longer tolerate. In the north of the continent we have for long endured the Middle East conflict. We had hoped that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) would be accepted by all parties as the basis for solving this particular conflict  but it seems that our hopes are not being fulfilled. In the south we witness the worst forms of inhumanity by man to man  an imperialism which seeks to enslave the soil of the African under the doctrine of white-skin racial superiority. The various resolutions of this Assembly condemning apartheid and racial discrimination have failed to have any effect on the racist regimes. In scattered pockets of the continent  colonialist Powers like Portugal continue to impose the yoke of colonialism and imperialist domination on peace-loving Africans in continued defiance of resolution 1514 (XV) and other resolutions of this body. Even those African States which have won their independence the hard way now face a new form of neo-imperialism. Certain big Powers not only directly interfere in their internal affairs  but even stir up internal subversion and mercenary activity in order to topple progressive African Governments not to their liking.138.	Africa is the continent now zealously trying to evolve new and practical democratic patterns  utilizing some of the norms handed over by the erstwhile colonial masters  while at the same time inventing and applying political institutions which would project the African personality. My delegation implores the various Governments assailing the Independence of Africa to let us alone and give us a chance to make our own contribution to the cause of international peace.139. The Middle East conflict seems to be oscillating between hope and despair. Towards the beginning of the year there was hope that an end to the conflict was in sight. As we meet during this session  those hopes seem to be receding into the distance. We have had problems of the kidnapping of personnel in Syria and southern Lebanon by Israel  and we join those who demand the unconditional repatriation of such kidnapped personnel. While these problems remain unsettled  we have been shocked at the recent killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games. Before reason could prevail  we witnessed military invasions against Lebanon  letter-bombs being sent to Israelis in different parts of the world  and a threat of the renewal of the conflict. My Government has developed friendly relations both with the Arab nations and with Israel  and it pains us to witness such carnage inflicted from time to time by either party.140.. We have always been strong supporters of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). In a joint communique issued by my President  Mr. Siaka Stevens  and Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia in January this year  an appeal was made to the parties concerned to facilitate a peaceful settlement based on that resolution. My delegation fervently hopes that Mr. Jarring will be given the opportunity to solve this problem. Israel  in particular  should understand that it is in its own interest for the work of the Jarring mission to continue to a fruitful and successful conclusion.141*. My delegation continues to propose  in addition to the Jarring mission  the convening of a peace conference on the Middle East conflict that would bring together all the partier concerned and recommend general guidelines based on the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The presence of the permanent members of the Security Council at such a peace conference would go a long way to justify the views of those who have been calling upon the permanent members not only to take effective steps within the United Nations framework to resolve the Middle East conflict but also to give their full support to Mr. Jarring.142.	The permanent members of the Security Council owe it to the international community not to get directly involved in the Middle East conflict  even by the supply of arms; rather they should ensure the early withdrawal of Israeli armed forces now occupying Arab territories and enforce guarantees by both Israel and the Arab nations that neither will attack the other.143.	Once again it is the bounden duty of my delegation to reaffirm my Government's stand condemning the apartheid policies of the racist regimes in southern Africa.144.	The African States have tried to frame principles of peaceful coexistence in the Manifesto on Southern Africa. However  we all know that the colonialist and racist Powers have completely rejected the principles of the Manifesto  thereby making it quite clear that the subjected African people are left with no alternative but to intensify their armed struggle for the liberation of their fatherlands and the enjoyment of human dignity. In the face of the adamant opposition of the colonialist and racist Powers to peaceful change  my delegation is convinced that there is a need not only to recognize but also to assist the legitimate armed struggle of the liberation movements in southern Africa. We would emphasize the importance of working out specific programs at the international level for providing materials of practical use  and other forms of political solidarity  in such a way as to make a decisive contribution to the eradication of colonialism and racism in southern Africa.145.	My delegation is fully prepared to support any action considered expedient to meet the South African menace. My country has already imposed the most severe restrictions on trade with South Africa and  in compliance with the decision taken by the OAU  my Government is committed to a policy of isolation  no-dialog  and the imposition of sanctions on the regime in South Africa.146.	We shall do all in our power to ensure that the millions of black indigenous Africans of South Africa are treated with equality and human dignity  which is their rightful heritage.147.	My delegation is deeply concerned that no effective steps have yet been taken to stop Portugal from conducting in Africa a war of liquidation  armed with the most modern military equipment  which it has undoubtedly acquired from its NATO friends. Indeed  we note with amazement that people who are loud in their condemnation of lapses in others are themselves so often guilty of the worst manifestations of double standards. Once again we call on those NATO Powers  without whose help Portugal really would be shown up in its real impotence  to desist from continuing their military and tacit support and to exert all the pressure of which they are capable to persuade their Portuguese friends not only to end brutalities against innocent victims in Guinea (Bissau)  Cabinda  Mozambique and Angola but also to practice that humanitarianism which is such a cherished virtue of the NATO Powers.148.	The situation in Southern Rhodesia remains precarious. The people of Zimbabwe have overwhelmingly rejected the proposals for a settlement  between the United Kingdom Government and the illegal regime of Ian Smith  and it is gratifying to note that the United Kingdom Government has accepted the Pearce Commission report. My delegation warmly welcomes that independent report  which truly reflects the political maturity and courage of the people of Zimbabwe.149.	My delegation is of the view that the United Kingdom Government should now be more positive in its action and attitude towards Ian Smith and his clique  who have recently defied world opinion by restricting the movements of African nationalist leaders in Zimbabwe and continuing their suppression of the people of Zimbabwe. The Government of Sierra Leone calls on the international community to do its utmost to ensure that independence is mot granted to Southern Rhodesia before majority rule.150.	It is my delegation's view that a national convention of all groups in Zimbabwe should now be summoned in order to decide the form of constitution on the basis of which that country should proceed to independence  and that all nationalist leaders detained should be released immediately so that they could participate in any discussion on the constitutional future of their country. The United Kingdom Government should assume the responsibility for summoning such a national convention  which should be afforded facilities freely and frankly to deliberate the burning issues involved and arrive at just solutions or acceptable compromises. Another independent commission  or even the Pearce Commission  could be entrusted with the task of arranging and servicing such a national convention.151.	The question of Namibia continues to receive our constant attention. We note with grave concern that South Africa is at present using Namibia as a base for violating the territories of neighboring independent African States.152.	I have already reiterated my delegation's commendation of the efforts being made by the Secretary-General as regards the Namibian problem and our hopes that the recent appointment of his personal representative will speedily bring to a successful conclusion the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the rights and interests of the people of Namibia and to lead them without delay to independence.153.	My delegation must  however  express concern that the fate of the people of Namibia seems to be deliberately entrusted to the whims and caprices of the racist regime of South Africa. My Government has constantly opposed any form of dialog with that racist regime. However  in the interest of the rapid political advancement of the Namibian people  and notwithstanding the 1971 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  declaring the continued presence of the South African Administration in the Territory to be illegal  my Government did not oppose the holding of talks between the Secretary-General and the leaders of the racist regime. It now appears that progress is being stultified by the intransigence of the racist regime  which is putting all sorts of difficulties and obstacles in the way. My Government wants to stress that a clear and unequivocal commitment should be made by South Africa as regards the unimpeded attainment of independence by Namibia. My delegation would also stress that in our view the sole aim of the Secretary-General and his representative in their dealings with the South African regime should be to bring about the independence of Namibia as a free and independent sovereign State.154.	My delegation is at a loss to understand with what justification certain great Powers continue to impose a yoke of servitude on a number of faraway countries with which they have no ethnic connexion. Those colonial Powers argue that territorial servitude must continue  either because the countries affected are too small to become economic or politically viable units or because they are culturally undeveloped or even because the inhabitants  after so-called referendums  prefer the status of colonial servitude. International co-operation on earth has now developed to the point where no nation  however small  however poor  is unable to govern itself; and no nation  however affluent or prosperous  is satisfied with being ruled by another. My delegation therefore once again appeals to all Powers having colonies  or what look like colonies  in Africa  in Asia  in America and in Oceania to take immediate steps to grant those subjected peoples a free and full measure of independence. If they really like you  they will thereupon enter into all sorts of bilateral treaties with you  and you can continue to help them. The international community would then be satisfied that your new relationship is not one of colonial master and subjected servant  but an association of free and independent States. Refusal by the colonialist Powers to grant their charges independence can only leave a sour taste in one's mouth and unsavory conclusions about disguised economic and political exploitation.155.	My delegation continues to be concerned with the situation in VietNam and condemns most vehemently the indiscriminate bombing of North VietNam which has been causing so much suffering  deprivation and hardship to the heroic VietNamese people. We still believe that lasting peace can be achieved in VietNam only when the political realities of the situation are taken into account.156.	We therefore urge that serious negotiations for a settlement at the Paris talks should not only respect the inalienable right of the entire people of Viet-Nam  North and South  to effective self-determination and true independence without outside interference by any nation  large or small  but should also create the facilities for the two opposing political forces to come together and solve their internal problems and differences on the basis of equality  mutual respect and mutual non-elimination.157.	My delegation is convinced that peace can come to the countries in IndoChina only if all foreign forces are removed from the area and the IndoChinese peoples are allowed to work out a settlement with no outside or foreign interference. We therefore join those who call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that area.158.	My delegation is disturbed by the fact that  in the process of the withdrawal of United States military personnel and other combatant troops from South Viet-Nam  the conflict continues to be extended to Laos and Cambodia by intensive bombing and fighting  resulting in irreparable loss of life and property in those countries. The peoples of those countries must be left in peace  without any outside interference  to settle their differences and problems. 159.	As far as the problem of Korea is concerned  I should like to make it clear that my Government has developed very friendly ties with both North Korea and South Korea. We have impressed on those two States the fact that they must realize that they are brothers.160.	My delegation continues to support the peaceful reunification of Korea without any outside interference. We feel that it is high time that the rights of the heroic people of Korea were recognized so that they can harmonize their differences and take their legitimate seat in the councils of the nations. We are indeed hopeful that the process of peaceful reunification will gain momentum within the shortest possible period of time.161.	My delegation is extremely happy at the result of the recent summit conference between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India and President Bhutto of Pakistan and we hope that these talks will continue with fruitful results for India  Pakistan and Bangladesh  and with a happy solution to the problem of repatriation of prisoners of war and a lasting peace in the Indian subcontinent. We trust that the many points of the Simla Agreement will be honored by all parties  and that Bangladesh will soon take its rightful place in the comity of nations.162.	Germany is in more or less the same position as Korea  and the German peoples have for more than a quarter of a century remained apart. My delegation welcomes the talks which have been taking place between the two German States. Last year I expressed the hope from this podium [1949th meeting] that the evident entente in East-West relations would result in removing all obstacles in the way of the people of Germany being represented in this world Assembly.163.	My delegation is deeply concerned at the fact that a great nation like Germany is still outside the United Nations. We are convinced that the time is ripe for Germany to play its part on the international scene. While we would not like the General Assembly to enter into discussions which might tend to magnify the differences between the two brother States  we would appeal to this session of the General Assembly to look at the German problem constructively in order to bring about a solution to the question of the admission of Germany into this world body. If the two parts of the same country still prefer to go their separate ways  we should respect their inclinations and facilitate their entry as two brother States. Twin States may soon recognize that it is better for them to become unitary than to remain divergent. The decision however should be theirs and not ours.164.	The past year has been truly called the year of international detente. We have witnessed a general rapprochement in international relations. The super-Powers have realized that there is little to gain by open confrontation and much to profit from in. a policy of friendship. My delegation welcomes this diplomatic thaw.165.	In particular  we must congratulate the Secretary- General for emphasizing this international detente in the introduction he prepared to his report on the work of the Organization [A/8701/Add.l]. The Secretary-General has made a realistic assessment of present trends in inter-national relations and the Sierra Leone delegation endorses that realistic assessment. In this  his first introduction to an annual report  we can mark his long experience in diplomacy and his keen insight into present-day power realities in the world. My delegation agrees with the Secretary - General that the current detente among the great Powers is a historic development of the highest importance. The Secretary-General has  however  reminded us that we should not be too euphoric about this development since previous post-war indications of detente failed to materialize into a durable relaxation of international tensions. However  my delegation is happy that the super-Powers are coming together and are giving every indication that they realize that it is better to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks. My delegation welcomes this evident policy of the great Powers to confront each other without warlike belligerency  the tendency to minimize the military aspects of power in great-Power relationships  and the evident emergence of an era of negotiation  an era of dialog and contact among the bigger brothers of the international community.166.	My delegation also supports the thesis of the Secretary-General that the very fact of this international thaw calls for stronger vigilance and  we would stress  vigilance on the part of the nations of the third world  The super-Powers have embarked on a policy of detente because  among other reasons  they feel that the third world is becoming important. It is apparent  for example  that the third world  commanding a majority in the United Nations General Assembly  can adopt resolutions which  to say the least  might prove embarrassing to the super-Powers if they continued in open confrontation one against the other.167.	The tendency unfortunately seems to be for great Power ddtente to lead to great-Power recognition of exclusive spheres of great Power influence in various areas of international relations. The great Powers are coming to realize that with the growing democratization of the United Nations system they will not be getting their own way  particularly in the United Nations General Assembly  They are therefore devising a system of arrogating to themselves the responsibility for deciding the major issues of the world outside the United Nations  and many of those issues fundamentally touch the life and the very existence of the countries of the third world.168.	My delegation wishes to stress that this tendency is not in the interest of the United Nations in general nor of the developing countries in particular. The latter are now being sacrificed as pawns in super-Power politics. It is for that reason that my delegation whole-heartedly supports the call of the Secretary-General for all and sundry to realize that the super-Powers ought to accept the fact that the United Nations  their own creation  should be the central institution for harmonizing international action. We ought jealously to guard against the great Powers taking important problems away from the United Nations system to solve them in accordance with their own desires and inclinations. 169.	The Secretary-General has warned that twice in this century world wars have resulted from the shortcomings of the old diplomacy in regulating the relations of the international community within the ambit of the policies of the powerful States [see A/870.1/Add. 1  p. 2]. The League of Nations was born because the members then genuinely felt that some order must be brought into the chaotic relationships of the international community. The League of Nations came to an end because  inter alia  the great Powers decided to solve the important and basic problems outside the League system.170.	The United Nations was conceived 27 years ago to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We must be careful that the United Nations does not suffer the fate of the League  because the super-Powers want to make themselves the rulers of the United Nations by solving world problems without reference to this Organization. The problems facing the Middle East  those facing Southern Rhodesia  those facing Namibia  those facing Korea  those facing the IndoChina peninsula  those facing the world monetary system  those facing world trade  are all of great concern to the international community and should be solved with the genuine co-operation of all the members of the international community. The tendency  however  is for certain great Powers to insist that those problems should be solved by reference to them and them alone. That tendency must be resisted.171.	It is not only the great Powers which are prone to weaken the structure and efficacy of the United Nations by taking the solution of problems outside this Organization. Certain smaller States are equally guilty. The Secretary- General in his introduction has drawn attention to the fast that measures to reach solutions in countries such as Koraa  India and Pakistan  and Germany are being taken outside the United Nations. While my delegation welcomes the efforts of smaller countries and countries which cannot be regarded as super-Powers to reach amicable solutions of their domestic or regional problems  nevertheless we would beg that the United Nations be brought more and more closely into the negotiation of such solutions. The Secretary-General has aptly advised that""The United Nations provides  or should provide  the means by which all nations  great and small  participate on a basis of sovereign equality in the political process of establishing and maintaining international peace and security  in facing common problems through co-operation  and in planning and organizing for a better future."" [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 2.J [A/8701/Add. 1  p. 2.}If the United Nations is to fulfill that role  then we  its Members  should realize that some changes ought to be made in its structure.172.	The United Nations was conceived when the circumstances prevailing in the world were totally different from what they are now. My delegation believes that the Charter of the United Nations ought to be reviewed and improved to take account of the changed conditions and in particular to ensure that the Organization is not impotent when effective action is required. It is necessary to strive hard for changes in the Charter to give more regulatory powers to the General Assembly  to expand the membership of theSecurity Council  to review its functions and efficacy and to amend the veto powers to take account of the views of the third world  generally known as the developing countries.173.	The United Nations  despite its shortcomings  remains  if properly utilized  an effective institution for maintaining international peace and harmonizing inter-national relationships. It has been correctly stated that if the early fathers had not founded the United Nations after the Second World War necessity would have dictated that the institution  be established within 10 years after that event. We should not now allow the detente prevailing among the super-Powers to kill the United Nations or even to frustrate the attainment of its lofty ideals.174.	In spite of the apparent relaxation of tension among the super-Powers and a clearly noticeable improvement in the political atmosphere in Europe  there is nevertheless increasing competition among the same super-Powers in. certain other regions  and especially in the seas and oceans. It is therefore absolutely necessary for the United Nations to do all in its power to promote a better climate so far as the call for world disarmament is concerned.175.	Last year my delegation endorsed the proposal for a world disarmament conference at the level of the United Nations. We then pointed out that a nuclear holocaust would affect not only the super-Powers but also all the other nations of the world. We therefore advocated that the superpowers should recognize that the peace-loving nations of the earth had an equally potent interest in disarmament and peace research.176.	In this connexion my delegation welcomes the agreements signed in Moscow by the United States and the Soviet Union during President Nixon's visit in May of this year. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks symbolize the existing nuclear parity between the two super-States. We believe that it is a hopeful sign that the super-Powers  possessors of such awesome weapons  now recognize the futility of continuing the nuclear arms race. My delegation expresses the hope that the super-Powers will now turn their attention towards devising a more comprehensive agreement on limiting offensive and defensive nuclear weapons  bearing in mind the necessity for a newer definition of the term ""aggression"". Indeed my delegation is of the opinion that at this session of the United Nations General Assembly representatives should continue the debate on the meaning of the term ""aggression"".177.	At the moment disarmament matters are being discussed in two separate forums. There is  first  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  which meets regularly in Geneva. There are also the bilateral arms negotiations taking place  between the United States and the Soviet Union. My delegation recognizes the value of the existing machinery for disarmament negotiations. We must repeat  however  that if these are to be successful all the nations of the world ought to be involved. We therefore stress the necessity for examing all disarmament questions on a broad basis in a world disarmament conference at which it will be possible for all States to express their views. It must be recognized  however  that such a conference need not prejudice the usefulness of the existing machinery for disarmament negotiations. This strategy becomes imperative since  in spite of all the talks taking place  in spite of all the background negotiations  in spite of all the treaties  such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]  which have been signed  nuclear tests continue. The opportunity for the world to come together in a world disarmament conference should engender hopes for complete disarmament even if that would take some time to achieve.178.	The issue of international terrorism should be the concern of the entire international community. The incidents of hijacking of domestic airlines and armed attacks against innocent passengers should be the concern of all of us. It is no excuse that these savage acts may be directed against particular countries or peoples; as long as they involve attacks on commercial airlines and international gatherings such as the last Olympic Games in Munich they are in fact a danger to all mankind. International terrorism has degenerated into criminal kidnapping of ambassadors and top executives and even innocent school-children. Heaven only knows where it will end if concerted action is not taken to deal with this scourge. The entire international community must join in eradicating it.179.	It is unfortunate that certain Western countries are creating the impression that African States  among others  are opposed to the inclusion of this item on the agenda [item 92]. No truly responsible country could oppose the inclusion of such an important item  which concerns the safety of all of us.180.	However  any resolution on this subject which would tend to interfere with the genuine liberation movements in colonial territories or expose them to armed attacks by the racist regimes of South Africa  Southern Rhodesia and Portugal will be strongly opposed by my delegation  for the right to self-determination for all the colonial peoples of the world is one of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  and for its attainment the liberation movements are a necessity. In this connexion  it is imperative that the term ""terrorism"" be clearly defined before the matter is debated.181.	The problems which attend great-Power detente are not political only: there are also economic problems  as can be seen from the results of the third session of UNCTAD. My Government continues to be greatly disturbed at the existing wide gulf between the developed and the developing nations and UNCTAD's failure at that session to arrive at effective measures to narrow that gap. We firmly believe that the developed nations must be willing to help the developing nations in their just struggle for economic independence and social advancement.182.	As far as the Government of Sierra Leone is concerned  the results of the third session of UNCTAD were most disappointing. Many resolutions adopted in Santiago were not commensurate with the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] or with resolutions adopted at earlier sessions of UNCTAD or of the United Nations. More than half of the resolutions adopted at the third session were not supported by the Governments of developed countries  which therefore could not be expected to implement them. The impression left was that the Governments of the developed countries wanted to replace the multinational framework of negotiations by bilateral relations with developing countries- bilateral relations which the world still condemns in the existing system of international trade and developmental aid.183.	My Government prefers the multinational approach to the solution of international trade and other inequalities rather than the bilateral approach. We are sovereign States even if we may be classed as poor  developing States. It is in our view necessary to make development aid become  not a weapon of division  but an instrument for real development  an instrument for co-operation and integration not only among the countries of any particular region but also among recipients and donors as a group rather than as individual States.184.	My Government will therefore continue to play its proper role in the task of UNCTAD particularly in reducing the trade gap between the developing and the developed countries. My delegation would favor a review of the shortcomings and failures of the third session of UNCTAD  particularly in so far as developing countries are concerned  so that we can all co-operate to make the fourth session of UNCTAD a real success. My Government calls for cooperation between the developing countries and the developed countries. We strongly believe that the developed nations must be willing to help the developing nations in their just struggle for economic independence.185.	Sierra Leone  for example  continues to import brushes to keep our tables and floors clean when we produce the timber that provides the handles for the brushes  the piassava that provides the bristles and the iron ore which provides the steel clips to fix the piassava to the wood. We are not alone in such experiences and  to make matters worse  efforts have been made and still are being made in some developed countries to replace natural products by synthetic substitutes. My delegation pleads with the developed countries to take all appropriate measures to discourage production of synthetics and substitutes  particularly those competing directly with the natural products of the developing nations.186.	I have already pointed out that great-Power detente might lead to many economic problems for us  the developing countries. We must realize that new forms of co-operation among the super-Powers might lead to greater economic exploitation of our natural  God-given resources. When only one great Power was exploiting a particular country  and another great Power was  so to speak  fighting the former  developing countries were kept poor. Now that the great Powers are resolving some of the differences among them and can therefore harmonize their efforts.in exploiting developing countries  the future is indeed bleak.187.	This calls for very serious and quick thinking on the part of the entire international community. If politically developing countries have been achieving their objectives  we ought not to fail economically. A number of developing countries still have a few reserves of natural resources left which they can exploit. It is necessary for the international community to ensure the proper and orderly exploitation of these natural resources in the interest of the inter national community in general and of the specific areas or regions in particular.188.	One such store of natural resources is in our territorial seas. My delegation therefore whole-heartedly welcomes the idea of holding a conference on the law of the sea in 1973  in accordance with a decision taken during the twenty-fifth session of this Assembly [resolution 2750 (XXV)]. As a coastal State  Sierra Leone attaches paramount importance to that conference for our economic development. In 1970 Sierra Leone proclaimed an extension of its territorial waters to 200 nautical miles. In so doing  we gave full consideration to the safeguarding of innocent passage for international commerce and scientific research geared towards the peaceful exploitation of the sea-bed.189.	Our sea resources in many cases represent the potential economic means we have left for our economic development. Ocean technology now enables considerable exploitation  which can take place as far as the 200 nautical-mile limit. My Government agrees with those who insist that adjacent marine resources should be used for the benefit of coastal and neighboring land-locked States  and that far-away nations should not come to depredate such marine stocks any more.190.	Before I conclude  I should like briefly to mention a matter which touches the continued existence of the United Nations.191.	Certain countries have recently complained that the United Nations scale of contributions should be revised and that their own percentages should be reduced. My delegation wishes to stress that the scale of contributions does take into account the principle of equality. If an equation were devised to show the relative per capita incomes in the Member States  such an equation would more or less correlate with the percentages in the United Nations scale of assessments. My delegation therefore does not support any policy of reducing individual assessments within the entire scale.192.	However  we should take cognizance of the fact that a number of new nations have been admitted into the Organization. These new nations must of course support the United Nations in accordance with the formula which has been devised. Care should be taken not to over finance the Organization  or reduce the over-all budget. Granted the optimum budget for any period  the burden of financing should be worked cut and shared among the variousMembers. This may of course result in the reduction Of any individual Member's contribution in any particular year.193.	My delegation would  however  warn that no action should be taken which would reduce the over-all budget of the Organization. Any such reduction would result in a lowering of standards as regards the caliber of staff being recruited  in a reduction of technical assistance to the developing countries and in the general ineffectiveness of the Organization. We therefore appeal to those who want a reduction not to shut their eyes to the dangers which might ensue from such a course.194.	We look forward to the great occasion of celebrating 1973 as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My delegation has read with interest the report introduced in the Third Committee by the Director of the Division of Human Rights [A [8820] and we congratulate the Division on the steps taken to secure the effective recognition of these rights particularly as they concern racism and racial discrimination. My delegation pleads that the axe of economy should not prejudice the work of the Division of Human Rights. The Director has outlined areas in which the effectiveness of human rights can be intensified. We should particularly emphasize the efforts being made to eliminate racism and racial discrimination  and we entertain the hope that the twenty-fifth anniversary will usher in an era of intensive and concerted action in this field and in the enhancement of the principle of self-determination.195.	We must not forget the un-ostentatious but nevertheless important work being performed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  particularly during this year in which momentous numbers of refugees had to be reinstated within a short period of time in the Indian subcontinent.196.	Finally  in concluding this statement I wish to reaffirm my country's unflinching confidence m the United Nations as the only saving grace for mankind in this age of distrust  of economic exploitation and of great-Power rivalry. We in Sierra Leone believe that only the United Nations will ensure justice and economic and social progress for the oppressed peoples of the world. We will therefore continue to give our utmost support materially and otherwise towards the progress and advancement of our Organization."
"105",6283,"SLV",27,1972,"My first words are to congratulate you  Mr. President  most warmly on behalf of my Government and my delegation on having been unanimously elected President of the General Assembly  one of the most honored and responsible posts in the United Nations. Your past activities and your guidance of this debate  as well as the very thought-provoking speech you delivered immediately after your election to the post  indicate most emphatically and objectively that this year we have a firm and widely experienced guide with an open  understanding mind capable of sorting out the difficulties and problems which loom over the present session of the General Assembly.98.	In years past my Government has defined its position with regard to many concrete problems of international politics. Hardly any of the matters which arouse interest  debate and even passions have been omitted from our analysis. Since my Government maintains an unaltered position on the items which appear on our agenda in one session after another  we need not this year reiterate those points of view and approaches which we have sufficiently explained and reasoned out. That silence  however  in no way lessens the due consideration which my Government gives to the many items on the approved agenda in plenary meetings and in meetings of the main Committees. We shall have the time and opportunity to define the points of view of El Salvador regarding the new circumstances and the process of evolution of the old problems.99.	Unlike individuals  international organizations have no definite coming of age. It can be affirmed that the United Nations was born big  developed vigorous  as measured both by the Charter and by its numerous world-spanning technical services. And yet  the sum of experience is important to guide  reorient and sometimes readjust the programs and policies which carry out these objectives  particularly in international organizations. In fact  while international organizations maintain the objectives which have been set  it is necessary to promote an adjustment to circumstances and to re-evaluate the complex set of initiatives and means of implementation and  in general  of executive policies. While the Charter is set and crystallized  the means to apply it and  more importantly  to make its purpose a reality are open to inventiveness  determination and the sense of responsibility of governments.100.	The United Nations came into being at a time when the need to rationalize international relations was obvious  and to some extent it responded to that idea so far as international peace and security were concerned. It was conceived  thought out  structured and endowed so that  on the basis of certain assumptions  which have frequently been lacking  it would guard world peace and security.101.	As intermediate activities which condition peace and security  the Charter listed the promotion of development  the observance of fundamental human rights  the reassessment of international relations by means of standards of justice. Withal  in the terms of the Charter  these objectives jointly condition and consolidate peace and security  which constitute the reason for the existence of the Organization.102.	On the basis of the Charter itself more emphasis could be placed on the aspects in which the United Nations could be more meaningful  since it is a matter of common knowledge that the basis of its incomparable strength in regard to peace and security has been weakened by antagonisms in the Security Council. Therefore we could reassess international relations from the point of view of justice and from that approach consider the problems of under-development and their solutions  the terms of trade  the transfer of technology and regional integration.103.	Although some problems can be solved if treated in bits and pieces very pragmatically  it would seem appropriate to undertake an overall study  at least' at certain moments in the life of an international organization. That overall review would make it possible not only to reconsider program priorities in connexion with the four or five basic objectives of the United Nations but also to analyze the viability of the policies adopted  the solutions applied and  in general  the whole structure  activity and internal and external co-ordination of the system.104.	That something has to be done to give strength and vigor to the United Nations seems clear; that the United Nations is undergoing a crisis of credibility in public opinion is recognized in official and private circles in many countries. But that the Governments which sustain this Organization have the firm and urgent duty to analyze the course traversed and assess the degree of fulfillment of the Charter and in particular to examine the distance between the objectives collectively agreed to and the political events of recent years seems a measure of prudent governing. From being very pragmatic we are becoming immersed in detail; from being very positive  we lose sight of reality; from being so aware of the immediate problem we are forgetting that what is immediate is part of a lengthy process. If in national States we think for several years ahead  it is strange that international organizations should live from day to day and draft their agenda year by year with frequent repetitions and without defining the major goals which would make it possible to assess and evaluate administrative activities  technical assistance and political achievements.105.	The United Nations Charter registers the objectives and principles of conduct which are compatible with the survival of national States; but it is not a program  nor does it present a strategy  and it is precisely there  in the program and the strategy  that the executive powers have much to do. Through the global strategy and the programs  the purposes of the Charter can be reconditioned and  by their interaction  we can reassess international relations on the criterion of justice. That reassessment on the criterion of justice  although veiled  is in the Charter; through the strategy and the program we can make explicit what is implicit in the Charter and transform into reality what is now but a seed.106.	The two world systems of organization so far known that of the League of Nations and that of the United Nations came into being immediately after catastrophic wars and reflected the conditions prevailing at the time. Since every written regime becomes crystallized  the Charter has constituted a recourse for those who want to give a summary  scanty  restricted interpretation of the obligations contracted; but from the same instrument one can adopt an executive  broad  dynamic and even ambitious meaning  for which what is required is neither more nor less than a genuine political will. There would be an opportunity within a global  largely political  review of the existing system  and we urge that the will to do this be aroused among all so that they may agree on a global and dynamic plan of action.107.	Every agreement that is written into norms is a novelty at the time of its creation  but its later effectiveness depends on the way in which it is managed; then it becomes a force of containment  instead of being used as an instrument of progress. At the international level  in order to keep pace with the accelerating forces of change  proposals are frequently made to revise legal instruments  and then renegotiation is barred by fear sometimes  indeed  by terror at innovations  and in the present case with mistrust among the centers of power  which within the established system  represent the vested interests. Thus we observe the fate meted out here to the very praiseworthy proposal to amend the Charter; it is shrouded in purely procedural resolutions  with nobody so far  being openly opposed.108.	Parallel with the reform of the Charter  and without constituting either an obstacle or a proposed substitute  one can consider the bringing up to date of the United Nations system by an overall review of intermediate objectives and purposes  programs and services  and ultimate goals. The activities of the General Assembly are scattered and unconnected in annual programs which meet episodic and passing circumstances. The agenda could contain the basic items of the strategy for the implementation of the Charter. For 27 years the United Nations has avoided an overall review of its activities and has refrained from drawing up a strategy which combines a sense of timeliness with the major objectives of the Charter: peace and security  international justice  development  human rights  regional co-operation.109.	The United Nations cannot attain its full relevance without a new disposition of power politics  not only in the strictly political field but also in the economic field. Otherwise it will continue to be the stage for the balance of the great Powers  with of course all the splendor required by the technological era. If there is a real desire to attain the ends  the proper means must be supplied  otherwise to desire the ends becomes a romantic or political recourse. The seriousness of declared purposes is measured by the adequacy of the means supplied.110.	It has been said that if the United Nations did not exist it would be necessary to invent it  which implies that without it the contemporary international community would be inconceivable. But we would add that were it to be re-created at this time perhaps it would be built with so much caution  so much mistrust  such a sense of rivalry  that its powers might be diminished. We agree completely with the proposals to amend the Charter. Such amendments must pursue a fundamental objective-namely  that of raising international justice to the level of a primary objective of the Charter with a status equal to that of peace and security.111.	We believe that this effort  although it is not destined to immediate triumph  will in time bring about results. The worst attitude would be one of conformity  that of giving in to an overwhelming  asphyxiating reality without a future  which tends to convert the mechanisms of the international community into a repetition of those which caused so much sorrow and so many irrational situations in the past. Knowing that in this case there is no immediate and definite expectation  we can only cross swords for what Should be  for that which is in line with a constructive collaboration between States  for that which leads to a new world order based on collective security  and on relations measured by justice  for that which leads to an international social policy. It is a matter of urgency to reassess internal relations by criteria of justice  that is to say  to transfer to the international level  mutatis mutandis  the sense of justice with which national contemporary States have readjusted and carried out their functions and consequently changed their image  structure and significance.112.	Within this reassessment one would have to rethink completely and from the very beginning-the problems of development and under-development on a world-wide scale  because it must be recognized that all the efforts and programs  which are good in themselves  have fallen short of expectations and that all policies of technical assistance  trade  transfer of economic and technological resources  investments and loans  and so on have proved to be insufficient although we do recognize that had such programs and policies been lacking the gap between the two groups of countries into which the international community is divided would have been far greater.113.	Since development became a conscious and rational objective of the international community and it started with the United Nations system and the specialized agencies several means of development have been attempted  among which it is worth while to recall the following: first  multilateral technical assistance  the most outstanding exponents of which are the United Nations Development Program  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research; second  financial assistance through banks and funds on a world-wide  regional and even subregional basis; third  the mass transfer of science and technology; fourth  private and public investments; fifth  world-wide trade arrangements by way of UNCTAD  which is one of the most valuable forums for developing countries. Today we are being sold another means  birth control  which some countries refuse to buy.114.	Without prejudice to the validity of what has been done and said  thought and planned  the fact is that the gap between the developed and the developing countries is widening  and this indicates that the means chosen have been inadequate as compared with the objectives  probably because those means have fallen short of the needs. The problem of development has never won complete and unwavering understanding among the developed countries; and so when after laborious negotiations what is deemed appropriate is obtained  it is already insufficient. That is what happened  for example  with the famous 1 per cent transfer of the gross national product of the industrialized countries. Tilings have their time and their reason  and postponements make inadequate that which was calculated for circumstances which have since been superseded.115.	Some Latin American politicians  intellectuals and technicians have sponsored and disseminated a scheme for vertical regional development  which would mean that a group of industrialized countries would take charge of a group of under-developed countries so that both groups would be connected between themselves by means of exclusive tariff preferences and other benefits. This scheme  which would divide the world into vertical zones of close association between developed and under-developed countries  is conceived of as an alternative to find a way out of the deadlock in which this major question is being debated and in regard to which the development strategy of the United Nations has proved to be powerless. Within that theory a world-wide approach would be to some measure replaced by a regional approach.116.	This scheme has attractive points  but it is delineated within ""the means which have already been abundantly used to promote development and there is nothing to guarantee that if these means have been ineffective on a world-wide scale they would not be equally so on a regional scale. Furthermore  the distribution of the world into north-south sectors would increase the political dependence of the corresponding under-developed countries. The scheme could be freed from its political ambiguities if it were to go hand in hand with a profound revision of the machinery and habits of the exercise of power.117.	In the great world-wide interplay of interests the under-developed countries benefit from the existence of several power centers  with which they can alternately negotiate and in respect of which they will in some measure learn to benefit from their competition  not to say their dissensions. The bipolar structure of the last 20 years has offered less margin for negotiation than the quadri-polar structure  which seems to be what is going to happen in the last decades of the twentieth century.118.	The disorderly and irrational use of technology requires that we think of the destiny of man on his planet. The world of the future must be international and to a large degree transnational; but as long as there is no basic revision of the mechanisms of world power  the under-developed countries will have to use legal and political methods which have been somewhat superseded by time but which constitute their means of defense. Thus  despite growing interdependence  they will have to work with national States  sovereignty  the legal equality of States and the host of principles and doctrines which represent the international strength of national States.119.	During this general debate the Assembly has heard the suggestion made at the 2050th meeting by the Foreign Minister of Mexico  Mr. Emilio Rabasa  that the underdeveloped world have a permanent seat on the Security Council  with the rights and the obligations provided for in the Charter. This idea should be retained and explored. Indeed  the under-developed world as a whole constitutes a considerable political force; its presence on the Council  with legal equality with the five great Powers  would introduce a healthy political balance in the United Nations. Some special rules could be examined: for example  the rotation of the countries designated  relatively lengthy periods of the exercise of that lofty position  and agreement on rules and criteria whereby the State representing the developing countries would make use of the prerogatives inherent in a permanent seat on the Security Council.120.	It is maintained today that we have to conceive of another model of development  very appropriate to the under-developed countries and different from that of the industrialized countries. This idea must be managed very cautiously because  while it might respond to the principle of being adjusted to the circumstances of time and place  which is very valuable socially  it could lead to the prolonged condemnation of a sector of mankind in regard to the advantages of the use of technology and deprive that sector of an active contribution to the great process of mastering nature and fully developing the potential capabilities of man.121.	Much may be said  but the fact is that the industrialized countries are only half convinced that the development of the less developed countries will objectively be of benefit to them. For i.hat very reason the industrialized countries have not come to consider that problem as their problem. Of course this attitude is consistent with the division of the world into national States  and perhaps it can be penetrated with a new alignment of States in the regions which are integrated. Part of the assistance pro-grammes has been subscribed to and maintained by not only political but also cultural and technical prestige and influence.122.	Growing interdependence is one of the dynamic characteristics of the contemporary international community  and some problems go completely beyond the capacity for decision and the power of national States  even of the strongest. One cannot create barriers and believe that indifference to what happens outside is in the national interest. There are no islands of prosperity  because problems transcend separatist and separating barriers and render any convenient indifference impossible.123.	A few hours' flight south of the megalopolis of New York  the political center of the world because it is the location of United Nations Headquarters  under-development begins  with its entourage of frustrations and insecurities. It extends south on the American continent  and continues in Africa  Asia and Oceania. The causes of this phenomenon are not well determined and must remain a subject for studies on sociology  history  economics and politics. But as for its lasting character  one of the factors at stake though not the only one is the overwhelming attraction exerted by the great industrial cordon of the Northern Hemisphere  which  independent of the wishes and purposes of peoples and governments  increases and  within the law of social forces  is unfavorable to the weaker areas. Only an international social policy based on the sociology of the international community and directed by criteria of justice could reverse that trend.124.	World trade unduly reflects power relations  and the imbalance in the terms of trade is a consequence of those relations. It is therefore quite normal  indeed  necessary  for the under-developed countries to strengthen their negotiating capacity by means of consultations and agreements so as to present a united front to the industrialized countries. Thus  the meetings of the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination  better known as CECLA  the prior meetings of the under-developed countries in UNCTAD  the meetings of countries exporting coffee and other products are all meetings which  like those on coffee  are devoid of any character of conspiracy and are alien to the purpose of organizing cartels. Nor do they intend to distribute markets among themselves or to exercise pressure on them. Their role is to bring about order and to defend themselves  and definitely tends to compensate for the negotiating weakness of one of the parties in order to restore balance of treatment in dealing with the industrialized countries  which daily raise the prices for their technology  machinery and services  but are alarmed when there is an increase of a few cents in the prices of the commodities they purchase from the under-developed countries. It can be demonstrated that over a 15-year period those few cents  which are very uncertain because they fluctuate  creating illusion and despair  are very much lower than rises sustained without any known decline in the cost of industrial products and technological services.125.	Furthermore  one must seriously consider an international division of labor and therefore the complementary character of regions so that each country will efficiently produce that which it is best fitted to produce. It should be left entirely to the under-developed countries to perform the economic activities for which their conditions are the best. Thus sugar and cotton  which some developed countries produce  paying subsidies to do so  and which they use to keep world market prices artificially low  should be the first products to be completely in the hands of the under-developed countries.126.	International assistance for development has had a series of achievements  but also a number of deficiencies and gaps which it is time to evaluate. There has been insufficient emphasis on the human side that is to say  on education and training. Europe was able to recover rapidly after the Second World War because it had highly qualified human resources. The Marshall Plan was a success in Europe because of that human base. The United Nations and the specialized agencies  while they have worked to that end and for that purpose  have created important services  but could place even more emphasis on  and devote more resources and efforts to  education and training. It is well known that administrative and management skills are lacking in the under-developed countries.127.	The under-developed countries do not know how to utilize their most valuable resources human resources  which are undervalued today because of unemployment and low levels of knowledge and skill. Underemployment sometimes amounts to 50 per cent of the potentially usable labor force. That valuable resource  which is wasted in under-development  could to some extent be used in self-help programs.128.	Local training in administrative and managerial skills on a scale suitable to raise efficiency levels in all public and private activities in the under-developed countries combined with self-help programs  whose techniques would have to be disseminated on a broad scale  and with the assistance of the discovery and application of a methodology to provide incentives and motivation for the people  could generate the internal forces of development at an accelerated rate.129.	In the international community  which is ever smaller measured in relative terms because of faster communications  a phenomenon similar to development in national States occurs: absorbent areas make prosperity a privilege  even though it may be an undesired privilege  while at its expense the rest of the provinces vegetate. The provinces which vegetate continue to maintain the prosperity of the large cities and industrial centers  and the rural population  which traditionally lags behind industrial interests  pays its quota of sacrifices to maintain the cities. The underdeveloped areas of the world pay their quota in maintaining the high standard of living of the developed countries  even though that is not the result of deliberate policies or of any thought-out intention. Thus it is well-known that  among other things  the under-developed countries  with their squalid economies  help to pay for the unbridled and uncontrollable inflation of the industrialized countries; that monetary operations carried out without their knowledge or participation cause them serious disturbances; and that the policy of low prices for their export goods is one of the causes of their indebtedness  since they cannot maintain their programs with their exports  in other words  with the fruits of their labor.130.	With the case presented thus  it is apparent that under-development is not a problem which can be dealt with entirely at the national level  and that an international approach becomes indispensable. Under-development  influenced by the combined presence of different  closely linked economies  is a world-wide problem—one for the United Nations and the specialized agencies. What is more  as some countries evolve from one category to another  the situation for the remainder will become even more difficult  and the need for a world-wide policy will be pressing. If matters are governed merely by social and political mechanics  in all likelihood under-development will become the mandatory fate of a large part of mankind and the euphemism of new models will then be sought.131.	Trade will have to remain the major source of development-financing. This is definitely an improvement on indebtedness. This is not the case in unbalanced international trade  in which the unbridled inflation of the industrialized countries  which in some measure reflects higher salaries and better living conditions  has no appropriate counterpart. Therefore  it is really frustrating that  even if viewed with understanding  and although targets and wills were renewed  the third session of UNCTAD was little short of a failure.132.	It is time we gave thought to other ways of solving this world-wide problem by removing its causes and dealing with them and their consequences. I have in mind something which at this time of exacerbated pragmatism may appear to be purely Utopian  but of which much will be said in the future: international taxes. It may be predicted that one day such taxes will be paid on carefully selected productive activities  which will most patently show that many countries contribute to them  either by titular right  as in the case of the resources of the international sea-bed  or when businesses prosper and profits are earned with the contributions of many countries  as in the case of multi-national companies. When we speak of marine resources we refer not only to those of the international sea-bed  but also to biological resources. And since we have to start somewhere  the sea appears to be the most appropriate object of taxation.133.	In opposing international taxes  arguments similar to those against national taxes will be used: it will be said that they raise costs  discourage production  etc.  but the fact of the matter is that national taxes do exist. They will also have to exist in the international community  even though they may now appear to be shrouded in clouds of Utopia.134.	Some of the most acute conflicts of interest in the new regime of the seas could be attenuated if a really operative means of generalized co-participation could be devised in regard to these artificially distributed riches  since water  fish  plankton  tides  etc. recognize no boundaries. As the ocean is the main reserve of mankind  a coastal band could be drawn for the exclusive use of the coastal country  with some commitment to contribute voluntarily to an international development fund. There would then be an additional band for the exploitation of which a small mandatory contribution would be set  to be agreed upon between the coastal State and the international community. Finally  on what is called the high seas-which would cease to be the privileged possession of the first comer or of the strongest-a more complex regime of international co-participation would be established  and contributory levies would be set up by general agreement among all States.135.	Since no world government exists  such a regime would function on the basis of treaties and  hence  through the centers which create international agreements  namely States; but as for management and administration  unless stagnation is the plan  a careful system of majority decision would have to be established-of course  without the right of veto-but by a well distributed and balanced majority.136.	These ideas are expressed within the framework of interdependence of interests and are therefore totally devoid of the concept of any gift. If it is really intended to organize the international community  one must observe the realities on which it is patterned. It is a matter of emphasizing education  training and skilled know-how  of studying motivation and incentive techniques  and of finding a reasonable international division of labour.137.	Even the best technical and human plans will be relegated to the sphere of speculation if the international community fails to establish a minimum of security. Principles and rules for peaceful coexistence among States have been agreed to; but now groups outside the context of States  but whose conduct influences inter-State relations  are making their own law: the law of indiscriminate and irrational violence. The international community must defend itself from terrorism  which is poisoning international relations and wants to substitute the pressure of fear for the persuasion of reason; threats for negotiation; and desperate  passionate and insensate acts for the evolutionary process of institutions.138.	The United Nations is a world forum of great resonance; but it is also  and should continue to be  an organizing brain and  in some areas  an arm to give force to the Charter  which  to a large extent  is a set of goals and a handful of contractual obligations to ensure co-operation.139.	The United Nations has its intrinsic limitations; therefore its negotiations require two elements: time and patience. Without these two elements  one of which is objective and the other mental  the complex negotiations which it undertakes would lack maturity. In the negotiating process haste sometimes means delay  and the distances covered are not measured by a dose of impatience nor by improvisations.140.	Essentially the United Nations is a great instrument for co-operation in fact  the most complex and extensive which is compatible with the survival of national States. For the present there is nothing in the international community that can replace it. We are firmly in favor of strengthening the United Nations at the political  economic and legal levels. We enthusiastically participate in its work and in its programs  and we realize that after several centuries of international relations governed by the law of force the process of institutionalizing the international community has to be comparatively slow. As Members of the United Nations  we take criticisms of the United Nations as criticisms of ourselves. The United Nations will go only as far as its Members really wish it to go. We are committed to a common task  called upon to influence decisively the lives of each and every one of its peoples.That is why we reiterate our determination to work loyally and most actively for the attainment of the purposes of the United Nations. We do so in our desire for peace  motivated by our law-abiding spirit and our feeling of solidarity for and understanding of the problems and aspirations of the members of the international community."
"106",6355,"SOM",27,1972,"Mr. President  my Foreign Secretary had hoped to have been able to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Somali Government  but  together with our Head of State  he has been engaged in a very urgent peace-making mission on behalf of the OAU. Since the mission is in its final stage and requires his presence in East Africa  he has asked me to undertake this task.193.	He has asked me to convey to you his most sincere congratulations on your accession to the office of President of the General Assembly an honor which you have justly earned and which does credit to your great country.194.	The principles and practical considerations which direct the Government of the Somali Democratic Republic in its international relations have often been described in this Assembly and can be summed up as a firm belief that the structure of world peace must be built  brick by brick  on the foundations of the Charter and within the walls of the United Nations. In the' past we have sometimes expressed great confidence in the ability of the world body to fulfill its mission to preserve international peace  and we have sometimes been deeply pessimistic about the viability of the United Nations. After 12 years of membership and  I believe  of fruitful involvement in international affairs  we realize that neither unrestrained enthusiasm nor undue pessimism are called for. The United Nations  like all living organisms  has strengths and weaknesses. The important thing is that it is alive. The important task for all of us is to ensure that it continues to have vigorous life. For there is no alternative besides chaos to the attempt to build up effective systems of international morality  international law and international government. As the Secretary-General has emphasized  the nations of the world cannot return to old theories of the balance of power that served different times and different conditions.195.	In a world situation dominated by the confrontation of opposing ideologies  by the gap between rich and developing nations  and by the threat of nuclear warfare  it would be folly to suppose that international affairs can be left entirely to the direction of the powerful few or to the unfettered play of national self-interest. And yet  the deterioration of long-standing problems which threaten international peace  and many of the events of the past year show that  however much the ideal of an international system is accepted in principle  in practice that ideal counts for little. We have allowed international political theory to outstrip international political action.196.	This is why  in the opinion of my delegation  the most important of the continuing items on the agenda of the General Assembly is the debate on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [item 35]. That Declaration [resolution 2734 (XXV)] is a blueprint for the practical application of the doctrine of collective responsibility for international peace. It contains the guidelines for action on every major question that comes within the purview of the world Organization.197.	The Declaration was warmly welcomed by the group of non-aligned States  of which Somalia is a member  because it stands squarely for the authority of the Charter and the authority of the principal organs of the United Nations; because it seeks to devise rules of behavior which will eliminate the use of force in international relations; because it adds a new element to the call for general and complete disarmament by underlining the connexion be-tween the annual world expenditure on armaments and the increasing gap between the rich and the developing nations; and because it condemns the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms caused by colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination. It is in the light of the principles enunciated in the Declaration that my Government will state its views on those international issues which are the concern of all Member States.198. My Government firmly believes that one of the strongest supports of the structure of international peace which the world Organization is attempting to build is the expanding role of regional organizations. The OAU is engaged in the constructive task of trying to eliminate regional conflicts  of strengthening regional ties and developing regional co-operation. In recent weeks this has been clearly demonstrated in the dispute between Gabon and Equatorial Guinea  and the serious situation that developed between Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. In the case of the former dispute much credit must go to the distinguished heads of State of the People's Republic of the Congo and of Zaire for proffering their good offices and to the Governments of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea for accepting them. The positive response of the Ugandan and Tanzanian Governments to the peace efforts of my own Government  acting on behalf of the OAU  has arrested a potentially dangerous situation and holds a great promise of restoring understanding and peaceful relations between two States which have always had a unique history of friend-ship.199.	One area in which international action lags sadly behind international political philosophy is the area of human rights  particularly as this concept applies to the oppressed people of southern Africa. The southern African brand of racism has been condemned by the overwhelming majority of Member States as an affront to human dignity and a crime against the conscience of the world. And yet  racism and colonialism outside of southern Africa join hands with the racism and colonialism of the minority regimes to ensure that white privilege will be maintained at the expense of the basic human rights of the non-white people. The racism that is open and unashamed within southern Africa exists under cover among the allies and trading partners of the white minority regimes. Inside and outside of southern Africa  neo-colonialism either feeds directly on the life blood of the native majority or supports the systems which so unjustly oppress that majority. Racism  expressed as the ties of kith and kin  and neo-colonialism in the form of quick returns on investments based on slave labour these are the factors which outweigh considerations of human rights and of criminal injustice. These are the reasons why those members of the international community which are most capable of taking effective action in support of United Nations objectives for southern Africa withhold their support.200.	The charge of moral bankruptcy can indeed be leveled at the United Nations for its failure to deal with southern African problems which not only involve human rights but which constitute a threat to international peace and security. It is a sign of moral bankruptcy when the United Nations campaign to eliminate apartheid is weaHned by the non-compliance of powerful Member States with relevant resolutions  not only of the General Assembly  but also of the Security Council; it is moral bankruptcy when the rebel regime of Rhodesia is encouraged  by overt and covert sanctions-breaking  to intensify the application of apartheid policies to the African people of that Territory; it is moral bankruptcy when Portugal  a country waging major colonial wars against liberation forces in all the African territories under its control  is given massive financial and military support by its NATO partners; it is moral bankruptcy when the giant corporations of certain Western Powers  with the help and complicity in some cases of their Governments  join hands with the South African authorities in using and profiting from the infamous contract labor system in Namibia and elsewhere.201.	The situation in Namibia has  of course  the gravest implications for the authority of the United Nations because of the special responsibility of the Organization for the Territory and because of the ruling of the World Court on the obligations of States in the present situation.  My Government has already made it clear that  while it will not oppose any attempt at bringing Namibia peacefully to independence  it will always insist that certain basic principles remain unchanged. Namibia must be a single  homogeneous State  not one divided and weakened by the imposition of Bantustans. The United Nations must never relinquish its responsibility for bringing the people of the Territory to self-determination and independence and the basis for that independence must be full political equality  the elimination of all racial discrimination and equality of opportunity for all the inhabitants of the Territory.202.	The United Nations also has a special responsibility for helping the people of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) to achieve independence on the basis of equal rights for all its people. That responsibility was assumed  at the request of the administering Power  when the Security Council  acting under Chapter VII of the Charter  imposed by its resolution 253 (1968) economic sanctions against the Territory in order to put an end to the illegal regime. It is now seven years since that action was taken  but today the Southern Rhodesian problem is as far from solution as it ever was. Indeed  the steady erosion of justice inside Southern Rhodesia seems to be matched by the erosion of some Member States' sense of moral responsibility towards the Territory. Now that the unacceptable settlement devised by Britain and the rebel regime has been firmly rejected by the African majority  neither Britain's responsibility nor the United Nations responsibility for the Territory has ended. But the recent veto by Britain at the 1666th meeting of the Security Council of an African draft resolution on Southern Rhodesia reaffirming basic principles of international action   points to a withdrawal from earlier positions which supported the oppressed people of the Territory. The fact that Britain's friends and allies on the Security Council abstained in the vote on the draft resolution was a further abrogation and a further retreat from responsibility.203.	The African draft resolution sought first of all to reaffirm the principle of no independence without majority rule. This is a principle which is insisted upon by the true leaders of the African majority in Southern Rhodesia; it is a principle that is supported by the non-aligned group of States and had the full backing of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which met at Rabat in July. In addition  it has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the General Assembly [resolution 2877 (XXVI)]. I state these facts to show that in vetoing this principle-andMember States were given an opportunity to vote on it separately—Britain was opposing the consensus of the world community. It was also  in effect  shrugging off the plea of the African people that it should not abandon them until they are firmly established in a position where they can claim the political and social rights that are their due.204.	The draft resolution also sought to establish  as a basis for a new initiative on Southern Rhodesia  that there should be a process of democratic consultation with all the people. Apart from the logic and the justice of this proposal  its necessity would seem obvious  following the complete failure of the attempt to impose a settlement that had been negotiated without any significant consultation with any of the African sections of the population or their political leaders. This eminently reasonable proposal has been rejected  as well as the call for the administering Power to seek ways of according to the people of Southern Rhodesia such accepted norms of political development as universal adult suffrage  secret ballot and the principle of one man  one vote"".205.	Britain's rejection of the principles which must be the basis for any just and lasting settlement of Southern Rhodesian problems  and the indifference of its allies  come as a shock and a cause of deep disappointment to many States  both in and outside of Africa.206.	Another disappointing aspect of the Rhodesian situation is that the United States will continue to break international law and undermine the authority of the Security Council by openly violating the sanctions against Southern Rhodesia which it is pledged to enforce. While the United States is not the only country which has broken sanctions  and its Rhodesian imports are a small percentage of the illegal trade with that Territory  it cannot be denied that its importations of chrome  nickel and other ores is the result of a deliberate decision of the United States Government and sets an example that ill befits a world Power. The United States cannot escape its position of world leadership or the responsibilities of that position.207.	The African States have always held that economic sanctions are not the only means of bringing an end to the rebel regime  but they do believe that sanctions are an important measure and that  having been instituted under the authority of the United Nations  they must continue to be enforced. It was the firm consensus of the Rabat African summit Conference that now. more ever  the United Nations should keep up the pres.are the illegal regime so that it is forced to struggle for economic survival and to feel the discomforts of isolation. Nov/  more than ever  the Smith regime should be made aware that its attempts to impose the apartheid system on the African people of Southern Rhodesia will be opposed by the world community with all the means at its disposal. Instead what do we find? We find sanctions widely ignored  even by States which claim to observe them  and the United States justifying its open violations on the unseemly grounds that other Powers are equally or more at fault in this matter.208.	Obviously we are witnessing in the case of Southern Rhodesia the same disregard for the authority of the United Nations  the same withdrawal from responsibility on the part of those most able to take effective action  the same drift towards support for the racist regime that characterize the other unjust situations in southern Africa. My Government is convinced  however  that in the course of this session of the General Assembly the moral weight of the world community will be directed towards preventing a deterioration of the Rhodesian situation and towards reaffirming the commitment of the United Nations to the task of seeking justice for the people of that Territory.209.	The challenge presented by racism and colonialism in southern Africa as a whole has never been greater than at the present time. My Government believes that strong emphasis must now be placed on support for the liberation movements of that area. We believe it is necessary for Member States to go a step beyond the mere recognition of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle and to take positive measures in support of that struggle. We fully support the Mogadishu Declaration  adopted by the leaders of East and Central African States  which concluded that  since all avenues for a just and peaceful settlement of the problems of southern Africa had been rejected by the minority regimes  there was no way left for the liberation of the region except armed struggle.210.	There are many who belittle the role and the motives of the freedom fighters  but this can only be through the bias of racism. The freedom fighters of southern Africa are not* less justified and not less heroic in their struggle than the members of the European underground who fought their Nazi oppressors in the Second World War and who are still held up as examples of courage and self-sacrifice in the cause of patriotism.211.	Moral leadership in this matter has been given by the World Council of Churches and by the grass-roots movements of individuals and non-governmental organizations in many of the countries which are southern Africa's main trading partners. It is the hope of my Government that that example will be widely followed.212.	The problems of southern Africa of course loom large in any consideration of colonialism  but it would be unfortunate if these problems were to overshadow completely the problems of smaller Territories in other areas which are also still caught up in the struggle for independence. These countries must continue to receive the attention and support of the United Nations. In addition to its interests in other colonial situations  my country has made it a cardinal point of its policy to advocate the right of self-determination and independence for the people of French Somaliland. This year two important international resolutions supporting the political rights of the people of that country were adopted by the international community. The first was in Rabat  in June 1972  when the summit conference of the OAU affirmed its support of the right of the people to self-determination and independence and called upon France to create the conditions-as France had done in the past in other colonial Territories so that those rights could be freely  equally and fully expressed. The same resolution was subsequently endorsed by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries during its meeting in Georgetown  Guyana  two months later.213.	The Middle East question  that perennial source of violent conflict  presents another example of how the best efforts of the world community to bring about just settlements can founder on the rock of national intransigence and can be frustrated by the determined refusal of a State to act within the framework of international law that it is pledged to uphold.214.	The retention by Israel of Arab territory  illegally seized and held since 1967  is a setback to the development of international law; it is a hindrance to the strengthening of international security. The Israelis have now publicly admitted what the world has long known  that they initiated the war of June 1967  that theirs was the first surprise attack. Even within Israel itself there is recognition of the fact that violent conflict with Arab neighbors was not inevitable and that the tensions existing then could have been reduced by international diplomacy. Armed aggression against other States  forceful and illegal territorial acquisitions  contravention of international agreements on the treatment of occupied territories  defiance of the clearly expressed consensus of the international community and of the Security Council-these are some of the grave offenses against international law and order that have been committed by Israel.215.	But the root-cause of the continuing violence in the Middle East over the past 25 years has been Israel's refusal to accord to the Palestinian refugees their rights  an obligation which was clearly a condition of Israel's recognition as a State by the United Nations  an obligation which is clearly spell out in numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and an obligation whose fulfillment is called for by Security Council resolution 242(1967). Wrongs left unrighted inevitably create an expanding circle of violence and counter-violence. Of one thing we can be certain: there will be no peace in the Middle East until the wrongs done to the Palestinian people have been righted and until Arab territory illegally seized by Israel has been returned.216.	One of the most distressing failures of the United Nations  in the view of my Government  and one which was highlighted during the recent 1661st meeting of the Security Council meeting requested by Lebanon  is the increasing unwillingness of some members of the Security Council to put the cessation of hostilities between States above considerations of national self-interest. The recent use of the veto at the Council's 1662nd meeting by a permanent member to kill a resolution which merely called for an end to armed hostilities in the Middle East region is a case in point  and the misrepresentation of this issue by the news media in this country did nothing to improve an unfortunate situation.217.	One would think that the primary purpose of the Security Council would be to try to put a stop to hostilities  particularly when these are being carried out by the armed forces of a State over which that State has direct control. The question of what might have constituted provocation of the hostilities was a separate matter and any member of the Council was free to bring that matter before the Council. In the view of my Government and this view has been expressed on several occasions in the past the use of the veto to inhibit the Security Council from exercising its primary responsibility for peace-keeping Was most deplorable. It was a serious blow to the development of the peace-keeping capacities of the United Nations.218.	The world-wide phenomenon of terrorism  which has many aspects  national and international  political and non-political  has become one of general concern  and the Secretary-General's initiative requesting that this matter be debated by the General Assembly [A/8791 and Add.l ] reflects that concern. It is now  of course  widely recognized that this question is a difficult and complex one and that its study must be undertaken with certain important guidelines clearly in view.219.	Some of these have been indicated by the Secretary-General in his statement in support of his request for a debate on terrorism [A/8791/Add.lJ  and it is important that they be carefully followed. He has pointed out  for example  that the underlying causes of terrorism cannot be ignored and that a clear distinction must be maintained between terrorism and the struggle of people fighting for their freedom and independence rights that are supported by the Charter.220.	It has been asserted by some speakers in this debate that international action against terrorism would obviously not be directed against liberation movements such as those of southern Africa. None the less  the need remains for clear-cut safeguards of the rights of those engaged in the struggle for basic human rights and for self-determination. The liberation fighters of southern Africa have been labeled ""terrorists"" by the white minority regimes and are considered as such by some of their friends and allies  even though the southern African liberation struggle has been declared legitimate by the United Nations. It would be a tragic blow to the cause of freedom and justice in southern Africa and elsewhere if the forces of racism and colonialism were to be given an opportunity to cover with an air of legality their harsh suppression of all who oppose their policies.221.	As far as isolated acts of terrorism which involve innocent people are concerned  my Government deplores them and holds that they cannot in themselves be condoned. But we do not believe that those acts which are politically motivated can be divorced from their root-causes when those causes include the suffering of long-standing evils which have been recognized by the international community but allowed to continue without hope of redress; when those causes have given rise to struggles that have been recognized as legitimate and when every avenue of peaceful change has been closed to those who seek justice.222.	A few years ago the historian Arnold Toynbee  on a visit to the United States  said:""One of the most serious evils in the world today is violence. You have to shoot somebody  burn yourself alive  do something violent in order to get any attention at all  however good your cause or causes  however patient you have been  however well you have put your case. There is an absolute stone wall of indifference all over the world.""223.	My Government will consider carefully all proposals that are put forward as part of the world Organization's effort to end or contain international terrorism. But it is against this stone wall of indifference to the pleas for justice from the oppressed and the dispossessed that we would like to see the most vigorous efforts of the United Nations directed.224.	The*General Assembly must view this question of terrorism with a sense of historical perspective. While the world Organization has a duty to use the peace-keeping machinery at its disposal to deal with all forms of violence  including international terrorism  it must be realized that this phenomenon is not new; it has only been brought closer home because a world which had accepted violence and terror as the natural lot of the poor  the weak and the oppressed  is shocked to see these evils applied to the rich qjid the successful. And where shall we place terrorism in relation to violent conflict as a whole?225.	The difficulties inherent in defining terrorism can be seen if one considers the war in Viet-Nam. That is an undeclared war; a war in which hundreds of thousands of Viet-Namese people have been killed or rendered homeless; a war in which a small country has received  at the hands of a great Power  twice the destructive force of all the bombing that took place in every theater of the Second World War; a war in which the senseless killing  bombing and destruction of human life and national resources go on without any end in sight. And for what purpose? For aims which in their origin were as confused as they were mistaken and which  even if they had ever had any validity  have been rendered completely meaningless by the political developments and events of our times.226.	That is no  just the judgment of one small African State; it is the judgment of the majority of the nations of the world. It is the judgment of the majority of the American people. When we consider the innocent human lives that have been destroyed or damaged by so-called terrorism  let us consider also the innocent millions of the civilian population of Viet-Nam.227.	The American-made gravel bomb that killed one diplomat was designed to kill  and has killed  countless VietNamese people-civilian and military alike. Is it more terrible when one such bomb is delivered by mail than when hundreds are delivered by military aircraft? Do the families of those unknown people killed by anti-personnel bombs in Viet-Nam grieve less for their loved ones than the family of someone with a more exalted status? One would think so  judging by the outcry in one case and the bored acceptance in the other. In the view of my Government  the terrorism that is being directed towards the whole VietNamese people is the one that should have the highest priority for concern by the membership of the United Nations.228.	Another unsatisfactory international situation is the manner in which the United Nations continues to be involved in the Korean question. My Government is disappointed that a viewpoint based on outmoded cold-war concepts has prevailed and has once again succeeded in preventing the long-overdue debate on the Korean question. The main reason for the success of the effort to prevent the debate was the misrepresentation of the issue. It was made to appear that such a debate would interfere with the movement towards a detente which is taking place between North and South Korea  when nothing could have been further from the case.229.	The Algerian proposal [A/8752] -which was supported by my delegation-had as its aim the ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea""  and was concerned primarily with United Nations involvement in that country. It was an effort to complement-not to inhibit or interfere with-the negotiations being carried out between the Governments of North and South Korea.230.	My Government has always maintained that the question of unification and all other internal questions can be decided only by the Korean people themselves. This is precisely why we feel that there must be a drastic review of the role of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabitation of Korea [UNCURK] and why the anomaly of a United States force in South Korea under the banner of the United Nations should be ended. The incongruity of the continued presence of that force- which is supposed to protect the independence of South Korea-is illustrated by the fact that South Korea is itself so self-sufficient  militarily speaking  that it has been able to send divisions of troops to Viet-Nam to oppose the liberation forces of that country.231.	It is factors such as these which hinder the reunification of Korea not a consideration of those steps which must be taken to put the United Nations in a proper relationship with the Korean people. It would have been particularly appropriate if steps had been initiated at the present time when there have not only been talks between Red Cross officials of the two Governments but also when they have taken the important step of declaring the principles on the basis of which they intend to proceed towards unification. It is particularly noteworthy that one of these principles is the desire to avoid all foreign interference or intervention by foreign forces.232.	The normalization of United Nations relations with Korea by the removal of the forces which remain there in the name of the Organization would undoubtedly hasten the process whereby old patterns of hostility would finally be eroded.233.	If the weakness of the United Nations is that it has so far made very slow progress in effecting the acceptance of new norms of morality and law in international politics  its strength is that it has been quietly and steadily promoting the concept of global co-operation in other fields. The achievements of such examples of international co-operation and planning as the third session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment may have fallen short of the goals set  but they are immensely valuable as exercises in the kind of co-operation that must eventually prevail in our interdependent world.234.	There is an increasing awareness of the fact that we  the nations of the world  are all partners in the business of planetary survival. One of the serious concerns of today which strongly necessitates a global view is the question of population  and my Government welcomes the increasing involvement of the United Nations in this area. We note also the rapid growth of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the expansion of its assistance in population matters to over 70 countries. Every support should be given to the Fund to enable it to respond to all requests from countries embarking upon serious population programs. Although not yet supported by the entire United Nations membership  the Fund has adopted guidelines which we regard as entirely correct in that it grants assistance only at the request of Governments and it does not advocate any particular approach to the solution of population problems.235.	It is often repeated that closing the gap between the rich and the developing nations is one of the ways in which international security can be strengthened. While this is yet another area where there is still a wide distance between practice and principle  yet the United Nations has set up and continues to devise machinery for closing the economic gap. What is necessary  in economic as in so many political problems  is the will to work for the goals set by the Organization—the will  for example  of the developed countries to implement the decisions taken at the third session of UNCTAD and to increase the scope of those decisions which still do not give the developing countries the equitable trading conditions necessary for economic growth and economic independence.236.	In this same context  my Government will give its support to the establishment of a revolving fund for research into  and development of  the natural resources of developing countries. The majority of the third world countries have rejected direct financial aid as a primary source of national development and seek to establish national self-sufficiency. This can best be done by the development of their natural resources. My Government hopes that when the question of the revolving fund is discussed in the Economic and Social Council it will be seen in its proper perspective: as part of the process of strengthening international peace and security through the building of economically stable societies.237.	We see that task not only in the perspective of self-interest but also from the point of view that a State must put its own house in order if it is to meet its international obligations successfully. Under-developed countries like my own are beset by a multitude of problems  chief among which are the colonial legacies of illogical geographic or ethnic boundaries; economies hobbled by restricted trade and communication patterns; non-existent or sketchily built infrastructures; and alien political and cultural traditions. Since independence  most of us have struggled through a period of continued dependence on the aid  methods and cultural impositions of the former colonial Powers. As pioneered by the leader of our own revolution  Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre  we in the Somali Democratic Republic are going on now to the development of national pride  to the encouragement of dependence on our own resources and to the arousing in all the people of national identity and purpose. It is my firm belief that this kind of national approach  this kind of reconstruction  is an essential basis for the carrying out of international obligations which all Member States of the United Nations have assumed.238.	In conclusion  I should like to reject  on behalf of my Government  a current view that the political issues which threaten international peace are better reserved for the so-called realities of super-Power politics  and that the United Nations would do better to confine itself mainly to the social and economic aspects of international co-operation. While most of us  and particularly those of us who are developing countries  have benefited  and continue to benefit  from the work of the United Nations agencies  while we are grateful for the campaigns to eradicate malaria and illiteracy  it seems obvious to my Government that the surest guarantee for the enjoyment of those benefits is a United Nations which is geared to preserve international peace and security  and whose Members  large and small  accept the rule of law as set forth in the Charter. That document  after all  has shown itself to be a durable and flexible instrument. It is capable of providing the basis for action in all the great issues of our times and of the foreseeable future  whether those issues are regional or global  political or humanitarian  social or scientific. The Charter's full potential must be developed to meet the needs of our complex and interdependent world."
"107",6519,"SWE",27,1972,"Mr. President  geographically and historically  the relations between Poland and Sweden have been close throughout the centuries. I therefore take particular pleasure in conveying to you our sincere congratulations upon your election to your high office.61.	Mr. Secretary-General  we have already had the opportunity to express our sincere felicitations to you during your recent visit to our country. Today I wish to state once again that you can rely upon the unfailing support of the Swedish Government in your devoted and tireless efforts in the cause of world peace.62.	""To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""-this very opening line of the Charter expresses our principal commitment as Members of the United Nations. To prevent  to restrain and to confine the use of military foL 3 remain the prime objectives of the United Nations.63.	War is unacceptable as a means of settling international disputes. This must apply also to the conflict in Viet-Nam. The United States has employed its immense economic and military resources to escalate the use of force to unprecedented levels. Immense sufferings are being inflicted upon the people of Viet-Nam. The physical environment of the country is being devastated. And this morning has brought a dramatic confirmation of the indiscriminate bombing of central Hanoi. The French diplomatic mission has been hit  and members of its staff have been killed or wounded.64.	This war must be brought to an end. A political solution of the Viet-Nam conflict must be found. The VietNamese must at least be given the possibility to decide their own future without interference from outside. As for South Viet-Nam  a reasonable solution would seem to be the formation of a coalition government  coupled with the provision of guarantees against oppression of any party by another. All over the world people are impatiently expecting the parties to the current talks to agree on a peaceful solution.65.	The conflict in Viet-Nam is a drastic reminder of the human sufferings that are caused by war  particularly to civilians. Many of the international rules in this field date back to the Hague Conventions of 1907  which are now out of date in important respects. Modern science and technology have made available increasingly cruel weapons and means of warfare. We have now reached a state where technologically advanced Powers can from a safe distance wage large-scale war on man and his environment even without the use of nuclear weapons.66.	The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have during the last few years been engaged in supplementing existing rules against inhuman warfare by new ones covering modern weapons and means of warfare. My Government regards this work as vitally important.67.	In our opinion  the need for rules restricting air warfare is particularly pressing. The Second World War saw the introduction of the mass bombing of cities. Area bombing has been carried out during the war in Viet-Nam. These acts of war are legally questionable  of doubtful military value and have terrible effects on the civilian population.68.	All use of weapons and methods of warfare causing unnecessary suffering must be subjected to international prohibition. A beginning was made with the 1925 Geneva Protocol covering chemical and bacteriological warfare.  In 1969  the General Assembly affirmed the comprehensive nature of that Protocol [resolution 2603 (XXIV)]. Consequently  the Protocol also bans the use of tear gas and herbicides. We must urge unreserved respect for this prohibition by all States. We must go even further. Dumdum bullets were forbidden at the turn of the century because they caused unnecessary suffering. Now  by means of international conventions  we must impose a similar ban on a number of modern weapons which are particularly cruel. The report on napalm and other incendiary weapons   soon to be presented to us by the Secretary- General  will no doubt provide us with a valuable basis for discussions on such a ban. Increased knowledge of the effects of modern weaponry should also serve to alert public opinion to the necessity of decisive international action in this field.69.	It is deplorable that the international community should today have to concern itself with modernizing the laws of war. We should all have preferred to concentrate on rules for the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of all peoples. Nevertheless  we must tackle the task of limiting  by way of mandatory and precise rules  the suffering and devastation brought about by war. World-wide popular support should be mobilized to that end.70.	Some of the problems I have mentioned fall within the purview of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. As for others  we shall have to consider further which bodies are the most appropriate to tackle them.71.	Under all circumstances  disarmament efforts within the framework of the United Nations must be continued energetically and must concentrate on particularly urgent issues  where it seems realistic to hope for results in the foreseeable future. A total ban on nuclear weapons tests and such tests are still being carried out undiminished in number and in strength appears to offer such hopes. The objections raised concerning the verification of underground nuclear testing are no longer valid.72.	It is a matter of concern that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] has not yet attracted sufficient support. The readiness of the non-nuclear States to accede to the Treaty is  of course  related to the willingness of the nuclear Powers  for their part  to contribute to armaments control and disarmament. From this point of view the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms is a step in the right direction  although this is not disarmament in the real sense of the word. We must now hope for further binding agreements in the disarmament field between the super-Powers.73.	However  all nuclear Powers must take an active part in future disarmament efforts. An opportunity for such participation would be offered by a world disarmament conference. Such a conference  in which all States should participate  could also give new impetus to continued efforts in the sphere of disarmament in general.74.	Last year's decision on China's representation in the United Nations [resolution 2758 (XXVI)] was an important step towards that universality which should be the goal of our Organization. The question of the representation of divided States presents us with specific problems which are not necessarily identical from case to case. Where reunification seems remote  the participation of such States in the work of the United Nations becomes particularly essential. The process of detente in Europe gives rise to hopes that the two German States will soon be able to join the United Nations. Both can make valuable contributions to our work.75.	The question of Korea's representation can be seen in a similar light. Korea has been a special concern of the United Nations ever since the early days of the world Organization. Divergent views on responsibility for the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950 should no longer prevent us from considering dispassionately the Korean problem and the role that the United Nations can and should play in this matter. We welcome the efforts of the North and South Korean Governments to improve neighborly relations. The international community has every reason to follow closely the development of relations between the two Korean States. If those two States were more widely recognized by other States this would probably contribute to detente and peace in that part of the world.76.	In the Middle East  pressure from the international community is essential if peace and detente are to be achieved. The fact that a cease-fire has  by and large  been effective for more than two years is of course gratifying. This circumstance must not  however  become a reason for our relaxing our efforts to reach a solution based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The Swedish Government reiterates its support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their endeavors to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.77.	The detente in Europe was greeted with great satisfaction by many speakers here last year. In this year's general debate we are able to register further progress in this respect. Strong forces are at work for a normalization of relations between the European States. But it is not enough to normalize and stabilize the situation. Determined efforts are needed to achieve a fruitful exchange and co-operation among all States in Europe. It is our hope that a conference on security and co-operation in Europe will contribute significantly to this development.78.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is our common guideline in the efforts to secure  in the words of the Declaration  ""the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world"" [resolution 217(111)]. For centuries the struggle for human rights has played a particularly important role in Europe. This struggle has known both victories and defeats  and such rights have rarely been extended to peoples in other continents living under the supremacy of European Powers.79.	The struggle for human rights in Europe has registered serious set-backs in recent years. This applies in particular to developments in Greece and Czechoslovakia. In spite of repeated assurances  the Greek Government has failed to embark upon the road back to democracy. In Czechoslovakia the proponents of the ideas of 1968 have been subjected to increased pressure.80.	The difficulties involved in finding methods to safeguard respect for human rights are well known. The Swedish Government welcomes the fact that since 1970 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has been authorized to receive and analyze individual complaints regarding violations of human rights. In this way a possibility has been created within the United Nations to focus attention on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We consider that the results of these studies should also be made public. Within international organizations we will continue to press for more effective measures to safeguard human rights  regardless of national frontiers. A vigilant international public opinion is an important contribution to the protection of those rights.81.	Where there is suppression of human rights  there is usually also a tendency to resort to violence in internal conflicts. To condone violence in such conflicts could undermine the inhibitions against the use of force also in relations between States. There may be cases where the inclination of a regime to suppress by violent means every form of opposition sparks desperate acts of violence from those oppressed. In order to find long-term solutions to these problems we have to identify and eliminate the underlying causes of violence. In many cases these causes may be intolerable injustices.82.	The urgency of solving these long-range problems does not absolve us from the responsibility of tackling the acute problems  which certain forms of international terrorism confront us with. Whatever the motive  the international community cannot possibly tolerate such actions as the hijacking of aircraft  the taking of hostages  or the murder of persons engaged in peaceful activities outside their own countries. My Government welcomed the Secretary- General's proposal for the inclusion of such problems on our agenda fA/8791 and Add.l]  and the Swedish delegation will co-operate in efforts to take efficient international measures against these forms of violence. This does not  however  absolve individual Member States from taking adequate measures to the same end.83.	While tackling the problem of how to fight international terrorism  we must not fail to react when individual Governments gravely encroach upon the rights of human beings on account of their ethnic origin. When whole communities in a country are subjected to violence on such grounds  public opinion in other countries naturally reacts with particular vigor. When a Government forces an ethnic minority into exile  it not only commits an offense against basic principles of human coexistence but also adds further to the world's increasingly difficult and tragic refugee problems. To observe silence in the face of such events would compromise the credibility of the struggle against racial oppression-one of the major commitments of the United Nations.84.	The systematic oppression which has been instituted and consolidated in southern Africa occupies a position of its own in the history of conflicts between races and peoples. There must be no weakening of international pressure against the apartheid regime of South Africa and its allies. Apartheid differs from other forms of oppression in that the system rests on an ideological basis of naked contempt for races other than the white. It consolidates an order where the prosperity of the white minority is derived from the poverty of the non-white majority. The policy of apartheid is far more deliberate  systematic and consistent that the manifestations of racial discrimination found in other parts of the world. By its very essence apartheid constitutes a challenge to the international community.85.	It cannot be accepted that apartheid should prevail also in Namibia. The Swedish Government welcomes the Secretary-General's recent actions with regrrd to this problem. We support all efforts to further reai self-determination a id independence for Namibia.86.	With deep concern we see the ideas of apartheid gaining ground among the white minority in Rhodesia. This minority openly defies the repeated decisions of the Security Council and aims at wearing down world resistance to its illegal regime. Effective sanctions against the Smith regime are still imperative. Every evasion of the sanctions must be condemned.87.	Portugal bears a special responsibility in this context  as it obviously allows its colonies to serve as a channel for illegal trade with Rhodesia. At the same time the Portuguese Government persists in its colonial policies  which have repeatedly been condemned by an overwhelming majority of the Member States of the United Nations. These policies are in open conflict with fundamental principles of the United Nations. Humanitarian assistance to the liberation movements in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) in accordance with United Nations resolutions can be taken as a manifestation of the donor countries' opposition to the policy of oppression 88.	The United Nations has so far been unable to eliminate racial oppression in southern Africa. All the same  we must not underestimate the importance of the fact that through the United Nations world attention has been focused on this tragic problem.89.	Today the United Nations plays an important role in international development co-operation. My Government wishes to see this role increase in importance  because in the United Nations more than anywhere else this cooperation is based on respect for the right of all States to form their own destinies.90.	The normative function of the United Nations  which is central to its work  is manifested in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. One of the basic objectives of the Strategy is to ensure that progress in a developing country works to the benefit of all its citizens.This objective has important implications for the policies of both poor and rich countries. It calls for far-reaching reforms of the social structure in many developing countries  as well as for greater economic independence. Demands for changes in the economic relations between rich and poor countries are an expression of this struggle for independence. The rich countries must respond in a positive manner to these demands. The primary and immediate responsibility of all developed countries is to fulfill their commitments concerning development assistance made in the Strategy for the Second Development Decade. The Swedish Government remains committed to the pledges made when the International Development Strategy was adopted. We note with regret that a number of industrialized countries are tending to cut back on their total development assistance.91.	The increasingly important role of development cooperation in the work of the United Nations is a reflection of the great changes which have taken place in the world since our Organization came into being. To a far greater extent than anyone could foresee when the Organization was created  the United Nations has become an indispensable instrument for overcoming those tensions inside and between nations which might be provoked by technological progress and industrial development.92.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June  focused our attention on problems which are of vital concern for both rich and poor nations. As the host country for the Conference  we noted with satisfaction the wide participation of States Members of the United Nations in the Conference  but regret that political disagreement prevented a truly universal representation. It is our hope that the Assembly as a whole will endorse the results of the Stockholm Conference  which can be considered as the first important step towards continuous and permanent co-operation within the whole United Nations family on problems of the human environment. My Government pledges its support for the establishment of a Governing Council for Environmental Programs  for an environment secretariat and for an environment fund. We in the rich countries who contribute so much to pollution have a special responsibility to pursue the work that has just started. However  more and more Governments in developing countries are anxious to integrate active environment policies into their programs for economic and social development. We are convinced that a general positive attitude will manifest itself as this Assembly now takes the next step towards an international environment policy. Our collective will to contribute to a better environment is a prerequisite for our being able to hand over to coming generations a world where life is possible and where life is worth living.93.	The deterioration of the human environment inevitably raises questions concerning the amount of available resources on our earth and of their distribution. These questions have a vital influence on international relations. They can find a just solution only through co-operation between States on an equal footing. This applies  for example  to the problems how the resources of the oceans and the sea-bed recognized by the United Nations as the common heritage of mankind should be exploited for the benefit of all peoples  and how the results of the ""green revolution"" can best be utilized to serve the masses of people in the developing countries.94.	In view of the immense problems confronting mankind it is natural to attach increasing importance to the United Nations. This is true not least for the problem of how the world's population growth can be regulated. A penetrating analysis of the population problems can be expected at the forthcoming United Nations World Population Conference. It is to be hoped that all Member States will make constructive contributions to that conference.95.	I have stated the views of my Government on some specific-but often interrelated-questions which are of special relevance for the international community at this time. Organized international co-operation for the maintenance of peace  of which the United Nations is the supreme manifestation  has aimed primarily at preventing changes of existing frontiers and treaty obligations by violent means. As a result  the preservation of status quo has often been regarded as the cardinal task of a policy for peace. But that cannot be the ultimate goal. The status quo alone cannot constitute the basis for a lasting peace. We must recognize at an early stage those tensions which necessitate change. We must continue to work for peaceful change in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. That is the only way in which we can proceed towards a world of greater equality and stability.96.	We all have a responsibility for the future of mankind. Our national and regional problems cannot be isolated from our common and global problems. The search for solutions must be a joint effort of all the peoples of the worid. The hopes of mankind for a brighter future remain centered on the United Nations. The United Nations must not betray these hopes."
"108",6563,"SWZ",27,1972,"Mr. President  I bring to you  and through you to this Assembly of nations  greetings from His Majesty King Sobhuza II  the Government and the people of Swaziland. These greetings come wrapped in the hope and confidence that this  the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  will become a tribute and a service to all mankind. You bring to this august body long and distinguished experience in international affairs  which surely reflects the history of your country  Poland. Throughout the historic session last year  your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  presided over this Assembly with originality  skill and charm. My delegation is confident  and happy  that the deliberations of this session of the Assembly under your able guidance will be meaningful and successful.2.	As you take up the reins of this supreme international body  new areas of tension in the world are emerging. Older and sadly familiar areas reveal no change for the better and some are flaring up again; but a few  just a very few areas  troubled of old  are showing signs of real reconciliation and understanding. The very geographical limits which once contained the strife and tension have become diffused so that the effects of disharmony can now be felt instantly  tragically  irrationally and by innocents half a world away from its source. Global involvement is manifest  and the global representation at this Assembly should see this development in its true and fullest sense.i3.	This body  this Assembly  epitomizes an international society which reveals  every living minute  the inherent reciprocity and interdependence among nations. Local problems do not necessarily remain localized and we  as a community of nations  would be unrealistic to regard them in isolation. In this regard  then  my delegation views with the utmost concern and alarm the continuing  and indeed the increasing  gravity of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The continuing failure to reach a lasting solution in this matter clearly requires the urgent attention of all right-thinking men and a strengthening  or perhaps a readjustment  of the apparatus set up by this Assembly to help resolve the situation.4.	It is most unfortunate that the endeavors of Ambassador Jarring in seeking means of finding a positive solution to the Middle East problem  in securing peace and in seeking to enshrine true national sovereignty for all nations in the Middle East have been hindered. The killing of innocent people cannot be justified by any man of good conscience. It is our hope that a solution will be found to end this human tragedy.5.	Swaziland would like to see all the oppressed peoples freed in the shortest possible time as we feel that all people have a God-given right to self-determination. A denial of this inalienable right is not only wrong but inhuman.6.	We believe in majority and in non-racial democracy. Swaziland believes in non-violent and peaceful means for effecting political change. We hope that our neighbors in South Africa  Mozambique  Guinea (Bissau) and Angola Will follow our example.7.	Swaziland cannot  as we have indicated in the past  support violence in any part of the world. We continue to recommend the application of peaceful methods of nonviolent change. But if non-violence is to succeed  nonviolent agencies of change or political activity must be allowed. For that reason we regret that the political expression generated by the Pearce Commission in Southern Rhodesia has been suppressed. The Smith regime has once again demonstrated its bad faith towards the African majority  and has sown more seeds of bitterness and distrust  which will some day yield a harvest of violence and sadness for the people of that country. In Namibia we are looking forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations designed to transfer power to the people.8.	After the experience of two world wars  wars which wiped out millions of people  nations and governments; after centuries of parochialism and regionalism; after the gradual growth of international awareness  Swaziland joined the United Nations and subscribed to the high ideals of its Charter. In this regard  the peaceful settlement of disputes without resort to force is paramount. We cannot  therefore  associate ourselves with any form of violence anywhere as a means of settling disputes.9.	So the war in South-east Asia  involving  as it does  forces from outside the area  is wrong and must be brought to a peaceful conclusion as soon as possible. In the view of my delegation  the people of South-east Asia themselves can best judge and create the best apparatus for their own livelihood and destiny.10.	We condemn violence in Northern Ireland among the Christians of that troubled British province; we condemn it in Africa  where some groups have used it as a major tool in a short-cut to power. We condemn it particularly in its global manifestation as air piracy or hijacking  wide-spread and often indiscriminate terrorism and political kidnapping. These ugly happenings  which frequently kill and maim innocent people  harass administrations and endanger vital public services  are especially evil and uncivilized. They divert national resources  all of which could have been channeled into means of improving the quality of life for some of the world's less fortunate people.11.	In two important and influential areas of the world  the fabric of national unity  where formerly there was none  can be seen as a bright star of hope for the future of those countries as well as for others still torn by conflict. I refer  of course  to East and West Germany and North and South Korea. This fabric of unity has not been woven easily and its pattern is still being developed. This Assembly  in the view of my delegation  should applaud these processes and in no circumstances take any action which might prejudice their fuller development.12.	The Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan represents a major step towards the normalization and harmonization of relationships on the Indian subcontinent. However  as one of the first countries to have recognized Bangladesh  Swaziland would urge upon this Assembly that the 75 million people of that country should have the right to membership in this family of nations.13.	The sorrow  misery and utter waste of human and material resources in two world wars and many subsequent confrontations have never been banished from our minds. The energies thus directed can be reconstituted and redirected in elevating the quality of man's life everywhere. There is now the technological skill available to translate all this effort into a race for peace and progress. Those areas of the earth and space which have not yet felt the impact of weapons should command all our attention so that no time is lost in their peaceful development for the good of all men. I refer particularly to the sea-bed  the ocean floor  the moon and space. Surely it is within our capacity to create the necessary legal and administrative structures  permeated with the fruits of meaningful human fellowship  to achieve this aim.14.	In this regard  Swaziland's sponsorship last year of the draft that became resolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace bears further examination. The area of this Ocean  up until recently not regarded as a sensitive military zone  is becoming a target for the less peaceful attention of some Powers. The nations that rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on their own door-step have no nuclear designs or any other hostile ambitions in the area. They are in the forefront in seeing that other Powers regard the Ocean in a like manner. Unless the seas and oceans of the world come to be regarded as areas of peaceful and economic development only  unpeaceful usage will become more and more difficult to stop.15.	Peace  security and prosperity are indivisible. The world economy cannot prosper in insecurity. My delegation believes that true independence derives from economic strength  from a carefully planned utilization of all national resources  material and human. Recently we have seen a detente in East-West relations which has opened up great possibilities for trade and for developmental financing among these countries. My delegation  however  notes with great concern the absence of a provision for developing countries in these arrangements and wonders how the objectives of reducing economic and technological gaps between developed nations and the third world will ever be realized. With this  coupled to the forbidding portents of the European Economic Community  if seems to my delegation the third world ought to be responsible for the control and development of its economies and seek a more rapid integration into the mainstream of the world economy by pressing for a fair share of international trade  by intensifying trade among themselves  by transferring modern technology to their own countries and by securing ready access for manufactured goods to the markets of developed countries.16.	Developed nations ought to liberalize their economic policies towards the less-developed nations and foster deliberate co-operation  combined with a political will  to alleviate some of the harsh external factors over which the developing countries have no control.17.	I now wish to reiterate Swaziland's commitment and determination to maintain non-alignment and our readiness to safeguard the legitimate rights of all men  irrespective of color  race or creed.18.	Finally  this Organization has one thing to hold most precious: it is the future. We can together  as Members of this unique body  summon enough courage  with the experience of the past 26 years  to release ourselves from the tyranny of the present and  with this earth's wonderful resources  to lift humanity to heights of freedom  justice  peace  happiness and prosperity. That is the destiny to which all of us must strive. And that is the destiny of glory for mankind."
"109",6631,"SYR",27,1972,"Mr. President  in the name of the Syrian Arab delegation and on my own behalf  I am happy to extend to you our warmest felicitations on the occasion of your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. The unanimous support for your election to this high office reflects the great respect and appreciation which the world community has for your people  your country and your eminent self.79.	We would also express profound appreciation for the constructive efforts which your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  exerted with ideal objectivity and which produced significant contributions to the positive achievements of the world Organization.80.	We congratulate Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his election to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations and wish him full success in discharging the onerous duties of his office with impartiality and effectiveness.81.	While we welcome the new Secretary-General  it behooves us to express well-deserved appreciation for the work of his predecessor  U Thant  who directed the affairs of the United Nations through most critical and stormy phases. We shall remember with respect and appreciation the work and the personality of that worthy son of Asia.82.	Every year we stop for a while to review and assess the work of the world community. If we assess the achievements of last year objectively and realistically we find that international relations have made little progress in promoting the freedom  security and welfare of the large majority of the peoples of the world. For  despite important developments aimed at reducing points of international confrontation  the majority of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America feel that their integrity continues to be endangered  their freedom constrained and their dignity infringed upon and that they are still exposed to the worst forms of exploitation.83.	These peoples welcome the elimination of points of tension that involved dangers to the very existence of the human race. They are also gratified at the wider acceptance of the concept of peaceful coexistence. But it is also their ardent desire that the beneficial results of the new developments should extend to the peoples of the world  regardless of their size and power.84.	In this respect the Syrian Arab Republic considers the proposed conference on European security a commendable step towards establishing security in a region which  like our country  borders on the Mediterranean. The Syrian Arab Republic has therefore expressed full support for the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 and the treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany on 12 August 1970  on the one hand  and between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on 7 December 1970  on the other.85.	While welcoming the proposal for the holding of a European security conference  we would point out the inseparable connexion existing between security in Europe and security in the Mediterranean basin. The geographical situation of many European countries and the interaction between the interests of European countries and those of countries bordering on the Mediterranean make any arrangement for European security that neglects the security of the Mediterranean countries quite futile. And there can be neither peace nor security in the Mediterranean region unless an end is put to the continued Israeli aggression by ensuring the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories and by restoring to the Arab people of Palestine their usurped rights.86.	Another significant development is the proposal calling for the convening of a world disarmament conference. As a developing non-aligned State  we fully support all international efforts aimed at complete and comprehensive disarmament that would free the world from its fear of a nuclear war by destroying existing nuclear stockpiles  prohibiting further production of nuclear weapons and establishing effective international control to see to it that these goals are fully implemented.87.	We are not unaware of the hopeful vistas that have been gained through these welcome developments  but we cannot overlook the oppressive conditions from which peoples of the third world continue to suffer. The Israeli aggression is continuing. With the passing of time  its dangers and the miseries it brings are ever on the increase. The peoples of IndoChina continue to suffer from the imperialistic United States aggression  while extensive parts of Africa continue to be subjected to direct colonialism and to the abominable practices of racial discrimination  involving  as they do  acts of plunder  exploitation and complete disregard for human rights.88.	Despite the efforts exerted by the developing countries  the gap between developing and developed nations in the economic  cultural  scientific and technical fields is constantly becoming wider. This is an inevitable result of the increasing inequality between the two groups of nations and of the pressure exerted from the outside on the peoples of the third world  which aspire to taking determined steps along the path of progress and equality and to making an effective contribution to the noble aim of ensuring a decent life to all human beings without distinction as to race  color or creed.89.	An analysis of the prevailing international conditions would demonstrate that the system of international relations set up after the destruction of Nazi despotism has not proved a success  notwithstanding the terrible sufferings of the Second World War and the lessons humanity should have learned from them regarding the need to uphold the objectives and principles we have all agreed to respect in order to ensure a better life for all peoples. True  the balance of nuclear terror has so far protected us from total and sure destruction. But  in spite of its effectiveness in preventing a total war  it has produced little effect with regard to barring of the use or threat of force in international relations. Moreover  it has had no effect whatsoever on the inequality prevailing between the developed and the developing countries. Many peoples therefore continue to suffer from enslavement  exploitation  occupation and persecution a fact which reveals the extent to which we have failed to achieve the lofty aims of the Charter. In view of this regrettable and dangerous situation the Syrian Arab Republic continues to consider it a sacred duty to share in the pursuance of the struggle against the oppressive conditions that threaten world peace and violate the principles of the United Nations Charter.90.	Indeed  the Syrian Arab Republic is struggling alongside those peoples fighting to ensure for humanity a future free from aggression  domination  oppression  fear  hunger and ignorance. Our country's determined opposition to new and old colonialism has entailed for us a great deal of suffering and sacrifice. As all members know  Syria has been and continues to be the victim of aggression  occupation and all kinds of threats and pressure. But we shall not budge from our position of unshakable determination to liberate our land and to fight imperialism and colonialism. We shall continue to maintain this position until the cause we defend is vindicated through the struggle of the peoples of the world to achieve for humanity freedom and a peace based on justice and equity.91.	In consonance with the principles we uphold  we have firmly supported and shall continue to support the peoples of IndoChina  victims of United States imperialist aggression. We have supported the heroic struggle of the people of Viet-Nam to preserve their national unity and territorial integrity and to defend their right to determine their future freely and without foreign interference. We reiterate our belief that the seven-point plan put forward by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam presents a constructive attitude to the solution of the VietNamese question.92.	We condemn the escalation of United States aggression against the people of Viet-Nam-the bombing of non- military targets  the deliberate destruction of economic establishments  dams and irrigation projects  and the wanton killing of civilians children  women and old men. The entire international community and the civilized world ask: Do not these acts constitute most hideous war crimes  directed against the whole of humanity?93.	The Syrian Arab Republic also condemns United States military interference in Cambodia and Laos. We believe that the Cambodian Government of National Union is the only legal representative of the people of Cambodia. We support the Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the IndoChinese Peoples  held in 1970  and believe that peace in IndoChina can be achieved only through the withdrawal of foreign troops and the exercise by the peoples of IndoChina of their right to self-determination without outside hindrance or interference.94.	The Syrian Arab Republic supports the new initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the peaceful unification of Korea. We call for the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  the closing down of the United Nations Command in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea's territory.95.	In perpetrating their crimes against the peoples of Africa  the colonialists and imperialists have resorted to all the methods of old and new colonialism  including settler colonialism and the imposition of a terrible form of racial discrimination in support of foreign minority regimes which have been exploiting and plundering extensive areas of the African continent.96.	The Syrian Arab Republic declares its full and complete solidarity with the African peoples struggling to end colonial domination. We also support the decisions taken at the ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]5 aimed at putting an end to colonialism in Africa in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.97.	The Syrian Arab people strongly condemn the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of South Africa. We also condemn the insistence of that Government on occupying and administering Namibia. We express full support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe against the despotic and oppressive rule of an exploiting racist minority. We strongly support all liberation movements in Africa  and particularly those of Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau).98.	The Arab people  which has been plagued by Zionist aggression based on settler colonialism and racial discrimination and by expansionist attacks in the Arabian Gulf  regards the peoples of Africa  who are victims of imperialism and colonialism  as comrade struggler against a common enemy that follows the same methods and uses the same weapons to uproot the native inhabitants  replace them by racist immigrants  impose on them political and economic domination  and usurp and exploit the natural resources of their lands. The Arab people of Syria is determined to continue the common struggle alongside the peoples of Africa until final victory is achieved and the last bastion of imperialism in Africa is completely destroyed.99.	The Syrian Arab Republic an early member of the non-aligned movement believes that the principles first formulated at the Asian-African Conference held at Bandung 17 years ago  have affirmed  despite imperialist plots  the will of the peoples of the third world to achieve liberation and build up a future for humanity in which peace and security prevail.100.	We regard the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held at Georgetown  Guyana  from 8 to 11 August 1972  as a step forward in the struggle of the non-aligned States to ensure a victory for liberation movements throughout the world over all forms of imperialism  colonialism and racial discrimination. The resolutions of the Conference supporting the struggle of the Arab people against Israeli aggression and occupation  condemning the crimes of kidnapping and international piracy committed by the Israelis against Syria and Lebanon  expressing support for the struggle of the Arab people of Palestine to regain their national right to their lands and homeland and their right to self-determination  and supporting the struggle of the peoples of IndoChina and the liberation movements in Africa and all parts of the world  have confirmed the force and independence of the non- aligned movement and its ability to withstand all forms of imperialist pressure. We are determined to continue the struggle to ensure the triumph of the principles of non-alignment  regardless of the sacrifices involved.101.	In this connexion  I wish to second and support the very sound suggestion put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico [2050th meeting]  rightly claiming a permanent presence of countries of the third world in the Security Council.102.	We have always advocated universality of representation in the United Nations and all its agencies. During the past year all of us have noticed the positive changes in the work of the world Organization resulting from China's regaining its seat in the United Nations. China has supported the peoples of the third world and is in the first rank of the States committed to the liquidation of colonialism and imperialism. It has worked sincerely and hard to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter.103.	We support the admission of all peace-loving States which respect the Charter to membership in the world Organization and believe that the admission of the GermanDemocratic Republic to membership in the United Nations would strengthen the Organization and help to promote world peace.104.	The political independence of any country remains shaky unless it is accompanied by freedom from economic dependence. To achieve this freedom the developing countries should follow an economic policy conducive to raising the national income and consequently the standard of living of their citizens. The gap between developed and developing countries is widening  as demonstrated by the third session of UNCTAD  held this year at Santiago  Chile.105.	We agree that developing countries should follow the path of self-reliance  initiate development projects and make efforts to increase the volume of trade exchange among themselves. On the other hand  developed countries should respond not only to the dictates of solidarity and historic responsibilities but to their real interests as well  and the interests of world peace and humanity in general  by taking the steps needed to create the political will to adjust international economic relations in a manner which will ensure justice and equality  put an end to cases of flagrant injustice and gradually reduce the tremendous gap separating the standards of living of the developed and the developing countries.106.	Realizing the great importance to the future of humanity of the topics of discussion at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm last June  the Syrian Arab Republic participated in the Conference and in the efforts that contributed to its positive results. It is to be hoped that the present session of the General Assembly will give the subject of the human environment the attention it fully deserves.107.	The Zionist-imperialist aggression against the Arab people of Palestine and three Arab countries which are Members of the United Nations is becoming more fierce and more flagrant  as well as more fraught with grave danger to the peace and security of the Middle East region and of the world.108.	The five years that have passed since the Israeli aggression of 5 June 1967 have revealed to United Nations Members and to all the peoples of the world the real nature of the aggression with which we are confronted.109.	The Middle East question  which is in fact an extension of the Palestine question  represents the gravest challenge to the United Nations and a most serious threat to world peace and security. The fate of the world Organization as a means of deterring the aggressor and eliminating aggression depends on its ability to ensure due respect for its resolutions and the principles of the United Nations Charter.110.	Although recent years have witnessed a greater realization by United Nations Members of the danger to the international community as a whole resulting from Israel's expansionist policy and repeated acts of aggression  the gulf separating the wishes of the United Nations as manifested in United Nations resolutions on the one hand  and the ensuring of the requisite respect for and actual implementation of those resolutions on the other  has become wider than ever  with the result that small nations no longer consider the world Organization capable of furnishing an adequate guarantee of their independence and security and the integrity of their national territory.111.	This challenge to the authority of the United Nations and the contemptuous flouting of United Nations resolutions relating to matters of peace and security not only constitute a threat to the authority of the world Organization but also provide encouragement to covetous expansion and aggression in all parts of the world  as long as the aggressor may be permitted to enjoy the fruits of aggression without fear of either punishment or deterrence.112.	Far from abiding by United Nations resolutions that condemn the use of force and the acquisition of territory through the use of force  Israel boasts arrogantly of retaining the fruits of its aggression of 1967  as it retained the fruits of its aggression of 1948.113.	Last June  five years after the perpetration of the 1967 aggression  Israel announced the number  type and names of the Israeli settlements established in the occupied Arab territories and produced maps showing the location of those settlements. Seventeen settlements have been established in the Syrian Golan heights  as Israel itself has admitted  17 on the west bank of the Jordan and 16 in the Gaza sector and the Sinai and 'Araba district. Israel  of course  did not announce the names and number of the Arab villages which have been bulldozed to make way for the establishment of those settlements; and no information has been given concerning the lands from which the Arab inhabitants have been evicted so that those lands can be given to immigrants coming from the four corners of the earth  after having been misled and deceived by the Zionist propaganda machine.114.	Israel is interested not in implementing United Nations resolutions but rather in implementing resolutions of the World Zionist Congress  of which every clause involves a violation of the United Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and resolutions adopted by the various United Nations organs relating to the Palestine question.115.	The resolutions of the twenty-eighth World Zionist Congress  which was held in occupied Jerusalem early this year  were more covetous and aggressive than those of former Congresses. They approved Israeli aggression and expansion  sanctioned denial of the human and national existence of the Arabs  mobilized Zionist resources for the colonization of Arab lands  and  with a spirit of racial and religious fanaticism  called on all Jews  wherever they happen to be and regardless of their political affiliations and of the regimes under which they happen to live  to emigrate to Palestine and the occupied Arab territories  and thereby participate in the crime of expelling the native inhabitants and obliterating the Arab heritage and civilization all this in order to help fulfill the mad dream of a ""Greater Israel"" extending from the Nile to the Euphrates.116.	At a time when Israel refuses to repatriate the Arab refugees and displaced persons to the lands from which they were expelled and which lie so close to their place of exile  the World Zionist Congress expressed deep gratification at the accelerated rate of immigrants pouring into Israel from all parts of the world  called for a continued effort to stimulate the emigration of Jews from all countries and regimes  and declared that the right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel is beyond dispute.117.	This attitude  which derives from arrogance  selfishness and defiance  shows the true nature of Zionism and its offshoot  Israel. Between 1949 and 1971 the United Nations General Assembly adopted 24 resolutions confirming the Palestinian refugees' right to repatriation. Also  since 1967 United Nations resolutions have been adopted confirming Security Council resolution 237 (1967)  which was adopted unanimously on 14 June 1967  and calling on Israel to repatriate the refugees displaced since 5 June 1967. Notwithstanding all these United Nations resolutions clearly upholding Arab rights over Arab lands  the Zionist newcomers persist in claiming that their right to these lands is indisputable.118.	Such is the logic of brute force which has again exposed to this Assembly and to the whole world the nature of the Zionist-Israeli aggressors  against whom our people  who aspire to liberation and peace  are obliged to struggle.119.	Israel's record abounds in war crimes and crimes against humanity-crimes which were defined by the Nuremberg principle   that definition being later adopted by the United Nations [resolution 95(1)]. It is  indeed  ironical that Israel has violated every principle and article of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949-a Convention originally drafted to prevent a repetition of the crime committed by Nazi brutality against the peoples of Europe  and particularly against Jews.120.	The destruction of Arab towns and villages  the changing of the Arab character of the occupied territories  the expulsion of their inhabitants  the imposition of collective punishments  the confiscation of Arab property  and the collective transfer of the Arab inhabitants to distant areas or to areas outside the occupied territories in order to have them replaced by new Jewish immigrants-who are avowedly settler colonialists all this constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and of the most elementary human rights and principles. The entire matter has been summed up by Moshe Day an  an acknowledged expert in violence and terrorism  in his comment that ""no Jewish settlement has been built on land other than that on which an Arab village had stood"". That was reported in Ha'Aretz on 19 March 1969. Confronted with these Israeli crimes  the Commission on Human Rights declared at its last session that Israeli acts in the occupied territories constitute war crimes and a challenge to humanity. 121.	Israel has raised much clamor in the world concerning the alleged inhuman treatment of Syrian Jews by Syria. Israel seems to believe that the world is deaf  dumb and blind  and therefore cannot see or hear of the racial discrimination to which the Arabs in Palestine and other occupied territories are subjected and which is also being practiced against colored and Oriental Jews. But Syria  with a good conscience  has always welcomed representatives of the world press  who have reported on the perfect equality which all Syrians enjoy  without any form of discrimination.122.	As a result of United States support reaching the point of abdication by the United States of its own personality the Israelis have assumed a degree of arrogance that makes them maintain an attitude of complete indifference to the world-wide condemnation of Nazi-like methods and mentality  to which the Jews fell victim in the past and which are now applied by Israel  not only against the Arabs  but also against certain categories of Jews who are treated as second-class citizens.123.	The entire world has heard of the desecration by Israel of churches and mosques in occupied Palestine. The attempt to burn down the Al Aqsa Mosque in 1969 was not the work of a mentally deranged person  as claimed by Israel. The attempt was repeated this year  but a strict black-out has been imposed by the Israeli authorities on reports relating to it. The whole world has heard  also  of the attempts to desecrate religious places and to plunder antiquities in the occupied Arab territories. Most recently  the conscience of humanity was shocked at the action of the Israeli authorities when the inhabitants of the Arab villages of Iqrit and Kefar Bar'am were prevented by force of arms from returning to their lands and villages  24 years after they had been expelled from them by the Israelis.124.	The whole world  moreover  has heard of the destruction  demolishing and bulldozing of Arab villages in the Jerusalem and Hebron districts under one pretext or another. Israel's policy of terrorizing the peaceful Arab inhabitants  which began with the massacres of Deir Yasin and Qibya 1948 and 1953 has been continued because the Israelis find it effective and are  furthermore  indifferent to its repercussions on world public opinion  as they believe they can deal with such repercussions through their deceitful propaganda machine and through resort to the blackmailing trick of accusing any State which fails to be deceived or misled by this machine of the heinous crime of anti-Semitism. Thus the anti-Semitic slander has been turned by Israel and Zionism into a blackmailing device with which to stifle all criticism of their policies and objectives and to victimize any individual  State or institution that does not acquiesce in their plans and maneuvers.125.	To justify their 1967 war of aggression  Israel's leaders used to pretend that the war was launched by them because the Arabs were threatening the very existence of Israel. A few weeks ago  however  Israeli generals declared that neither in 1967 nor at any earlier time was the existence of Israel in danger and that the pretense of the existence of such a danger had been resorted to in order to provide a pretext for a prearranged and carefully planned war of aggression against the Arab countries. To such limits have Israel's addiction to force and violence and its contempt for world public opinion reached.126.	The Syrian Arab Republic wishes to draw the attention of the General Assembly to Israel's refusal to respond to provisions of Security Council resolutions 316 (1972) and 317 (1972)  calling on Israel to release the Syrian and Lebanese military personnel kidnapped inside Lebanese territory. This kidnapping crime by Israel not only is an act of piracy  but also constitutes a violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 which bar the holding of hostages. Israel is clearly holding the kidnapped Syrian officers as hostages  as is evident from the Israeli proposal that they be exchanged for Israeli prisoners of war captured while taking part in military operations against the Arab countries.127.	Israel's failure to abide by provisions of those Security Council resolutions violates the United Nations Charter. The General Assembly should therefore take measures leading to the unconditional release of the Syrian and Lebanese officers and military personnel.128.	The worsening situation in the Middle East and the threat to world peace and security involved therein are entirely Israel's responsibility. For Israel persists in carrying out expansionist plans and in depriving the Arab people of Palestine of their national rights. The United States  which has used its material  military  political  scientific and technical potential to protect the Israeli aggressor against the Arab countries  shares in the responsibility.129.	The veto resorted to by the United States Government  for the second time in its history at the United Nations  against a Security Council draft resolution aimed at stopping Israeli aggression against Syria and Lebanon furnishes proof of United States backing for aggression. It also indicates that this great Power has abandoned its commitments under the United Nations Charter. The United States veto  which rendered the Security Council helpless against aggression  encouraged the aggressors to continue their challenge to the will of the world community and to launch a more extensive invasion of Lebanese territory on 16 and 17 September last. Following this  Israel further escalated that aggression by another against the Syrian Arab Republic.130.	In fact  the Middle East conflict is basically one between world Zionism  which invaded Palestine with imperialist and colonialist help  on the one hand  and the Arab people of Palestine  who were the victims of this invasion and who  having been driven out of their homeland  have been forced for over 25 years to lead a life of dispersion and deprivation  on the other hand. The United Nations General Assembly recognized this fact in resolutions adopted after the June 1967 Israeli aggression. In particular  these resolutions recognized that ""the problem of the Palestine Arab refugees has arisen from the denial of their inalienable rights under the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" [resolution 2535 B (XXIV)]. They also affirmed that ""the people of Palestine are entitled to equal rights and self-determination"" [resolution 2672 C (XXV)]  and they expressed ""grave concern that the people of Palestine have not been permitted to enjoy their inalienable rights and to exercise their right to self-determination""  and declared that ""full respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an indispensable element in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East"" [resolution 2792 D (XXVI)].131.	The Middle East conflict acquired new dimensions following the Israeli aggression against three Arab countries in 1967 an aggression that represented a new phase in the Zionist-Israeli expansionist plans and constituted a grave threat to world peace and security.132.	I affirm here that the attitude of the Syrian Arab Republic to the Palestine question and to the Zionist-imperialist aggression against our lands is firm and based on principles as well as on the provisions of the United Nations Charter  rules of international law  and the dictates of justice and equity. I also affirm that there are two prerequisites for the establishment of peace in the Middle East: first  recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to their land and homeland and to the free exercise of the right of self-determination and  secondly  the complete  immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories.133.	Peace in which the aggressor is rewarded is not real peace. It is submission to the will of the aggressor and a yielding to conditions dictated through force. Contemporary European history has shown that peace which is not based on law and justice is a ""respite between two wars"". Rewarding the aggressor in order to secure peace is an invitation to war. We therefore strongly reject what are termed ""partial solutions"". These are deceptive efforts that confirm and perpetuate the consequences of aggression through a false hope of achieving a formal peace.134.	Israel and the imperialists who give Israeli aggression full support and backing are deluded if they believe that a policy of imposing faits accomplis by dint of force can result in stability and permanent peace  which will result not from force and aggression  but from freedom and justice.135.	Certain well-known maneuvers and pressures have  in a particular set of circumstances  succeeded in getting included in the agenda of this session an item concerning measures to prevent terrorism [item 92]. It has been obvious from the start that the sources of these maneuvers and pressures wanted to provoke a debate in order to achieve certain political ends. The result was that opinion inclined to the necessity of investigating the causes behind the acts of violence. We welcome this outcome  and express the hope that the discussion will elicit conclusions consonant with the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter-first and foremost among them the right of peoples to liberty  self-determination and the preservation of human dignity.136.	The Syrian Arab Republic has always taken a stand against terrorism  whether by individuals or groups or States. Syria has not failed to record the principles it stands for in this connexion in documents of the United Nations and has never ceased to strive for these principles and for the establishment of an international society ordered by law and governed by justice  under a standard of peace.137.	The question confronting us is: What is terrorism andwho are the terrorists? To answer this question  we must go back to the Articles of the world Organization's Charter and there obtain guidance  for the most extreme forms of terror against which the world is protesting have been occasioned by the repudiation of this Charter and the principles of international law by certain international forces.138.	The United Nations Charter condemns colonialism and aggression  the use of force and the threat of force. Along with this we find that the imperialist forces and the States to which they pertain practice colonialism and aggression and intimidation and that their language is the language of bombing  slaughter  and genocide.139.	The world Organization's Charter confirms to all peoples the right of self-determination. Yet this principle is scorned by the forces of aggression  which pursue a course of domination and oppression to the point of divesting entire peoples of their lands and homeland.140.	The United Nations Charter postulates equality of all peoples  regardless of color  race or religion. Yet forces hostile to humanity and to the principles of justice and equality practice racial discrimination  elevating it to the rank of a policy and a philosophy.141.	What  then  is real terrorism? Who are the real terrorists? Is the struggle of a people for freedom and sovereignty real terrorism? Or doc 3 terrorism really lie in acts of aggression and occupation? Are the actual terrorists those who are struggling to regain a freedom denied them and a homeland from which they have been driven? Or are they those who denied those peoples their freedom and expelled them from their homeland?142.	Until recently many of the heads of delegations and the representatives now gathered in this Assembly were being described by imperialists as ""terrorists"". The voices which define and exploit the term ""terrorism"" today are the same voices which but lately labeled the freedom leaders in Africa  Asia and Latin America ""terrorists"".143.	As we move back in history  we ask ourselves: Were not Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and George Washington in their time the leaders and commanders of terrorism in the view of the ruling colonial Power? Were not the heroes resisting Nazi and Fascist occupation in Europe ""terrorists"" in the eyes of the Nazi and Fascist leaders?144.	It is a highly strange and dubious occasion on which we see the representative of Israel stand before this General Assembly to discuss terrorism and measures to prevent it. How very incongruous that the representative of those institutions of murder and terrorism  the Hagana  the Stern gang  and Irgun Z'vai Leumi another name for Israel- should speak of terrorism. Who was it who murdered Count Bernadotte? Who perpetrated the massacres at Deir Yasin  at Qibya  Qalqiliya  and Tulkarm? Who were the ones who blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem  burying innocent old people  women and children? Who was it who organized and executed the campaign of parcels containing explosives sent by post to Egypt  causing the death of scores of people? Who were the' heroes of the Lavon scandal? And who was Lavon  the main protagonist of this episode?145.	Was not Lavon the Israeli Minister of Defense at that time  the Israeli Government's deputy in the crime  arranged by that Government  of slaughtering innocent people? The Lavon affair took place in 1954 in Egypt. It occasioned the death of many innocent  good people  the burning of the American library and the bombing of the American and British embassies in order to sabotage Egypt's relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. The Israeli newspapers at the time described this crime as savage and barbarous  before Lavon's agents  Dayan and Peretz  were unmasked.146.	What do the Israeli leaders want  then  from this feverish campaign which has led them to say that the goal of peace now occupies second place in their concern? Do they not desire to prejudice public opinion against the Palestinian Arab entity and to gain the approval  even the participation  of a number of States in their conspiracy to put down the Palestinian resistance  preliminary to initiating effective operations against that entity? What they want  furthermore  is to divert the attention of world opinion from Israeli activity in occupied Palestine and other occupied Arab lands each day  every hour  minute by minute  actions of savagery and brutality  affronts to humanity  the extreme of terrorism.147.	We would alert and warn against this maneuver all those who abide by truth and the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is not aimed at the Palestinian liberation movement alone; it also threatens every national liberation movement in the world.148.	We are opposed to acts of violence which do not fall within the context of a legitimate struggle for liberating conquered territory  restoring the dignity and liberty of peoples  or protecting basic human rights. We do not believe patriotism is served by violence which destroys innocent souls. Yet we shall not be a party to exploiting an emotional act of desperation in order to block patriotic activity for liberation and suffocate in its cradle the legitimate struggle of peoples. We are firmly opposed to the massive terrorism for which States Members of this United Nations are responsible  as they practice oppression against peoples who are struggling for their freedom  sovereignty  national dignity  and the recovery of their lands.149.	The experience of the peoples of the world in the struggle for liberty and human dignity has taught them that injustice imposed on an oppressed people constitutes a serious threat to the dignity and security of all peoples.150.	Aggression and occupation maintained through killing  destruction  and religious and racial discrimination cannot suppress the aspirations of our peoples to freedom and liberation. Rather  they would strengthen their faith in man and in the dignity of man and their belief that a people's struggle even when confronted with destruction  occupation  and the concepts of racial and religious discrimination which the imperialists uphold will ultimately prevail. Those who are proud and intoxicated with their power to kill and destroy and with their success in aggression and occupation should remember that nazism  whose slogans and methods they imitate  has been crushed and destroyed  and that the Nazi leaders  at one time the gods of war and annihilation  ended up as criminals of war and the enemies of man.151.	Those who persist in aggression  in flouting international laws and conventions and in violating human rights would do well to remember that history proves that right will ultimately be vindicated and that the will of peoples is invincible."
"110",6677,"TCD",27,1972,"At the time when I have the honor of addressing representatives of the nations of the world meeting together here  I take particular pleasure in conveying to Mr. Stanisjfaw Trepczynski my sincere and warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of our Assembly. That unanimous election on the part of the States Members of our Organization is no mere accident  but is due to his many statesman-like qualities and virtues as a servant of the international community.21.	Permit me also to pay a tribute to Mr. Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  who discharged with talent and wisdom the responsibilities which you now bear.22.	I should also like to express my admiration to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our Secretary-General  whose great qualities  sense of responsibility  determination to succeed and perseverance are obvious to everyone. I should like to extend to him my best wishes for his good health  happiness and complete success in his heavy tasks.23.	Mr. President  may I assure you of the unfailing co-operation of my country which  as a Member of the United Nations  shares the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed  apart fromobserving the principles of the San Francisco Charter  my country makes it a fundamental rule of its foreign policy to foster understanding among all peoples of the world on the basis of absolute respect for human rights  equality of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.24.	Loyal to the spirit of the United Nations Charter  the Government of the Republic of Chad has unceasingly expressed its indignation at the subjugation of the people of Africa who are still suffering under Portuguese barbarism and under the apartheid regimes of Vorster and the rebel Ian Smith. Here and in the Organization of African Unity [OAU] my country strongly condemns the servitude of our African brothers  whom a handful of outsiders want to exploit for the sake of reactionary ideas which have been condemned by the world. The attitude of the Portuguese  of Vorster and of Ian Smith is an affront to mankind and has persisted far too long. The United Nations  guarantor of the fundamental principles of the Charter  should delay no longer in putting an end to this defiance by all appropriate means  because the very persistence of this situation is nothing but a flouting of the resolutions and recommendations of our Organization.25.	The OAU  of which my country is a founding member  is determined to bring about the total liberation of the continent from foreign domination. For our country this is the priority of priorities  namely  that the whole of Africa should recover the rights which have been taken from it. This is an urgent duty and we consider that it is a duty which must be discharged immediately. The assistance that it grants to recognized liberation movements reflects this determination to see the whole continent recover its dignity. The ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Rabat from 12 to 15 June 1972  was obvious proof of this  as were the previous Assemblies. However  the OAU does not at all want to act alone. It believes that it is its duty to provide a substantial contribution to the efforts of the universal Organization. Everyone is aware of the fact that the objectives and purposes of these two organizations coincide totally.26.	We must note that in other parts of the world there are persisting problems as burning as the ones that I have mentioned.27.	In the Middle East there is a period of respite at the moment because the situation of ""no war  no peace"" in which the peoples of that area live cannot satisfy our community. Is it possible to see here any kind of promising prospects for peace and harmony  or should we consider this rather as a mirage? Thus  in the face of this alternative  my Government thinks that it is the duty of the United Nations alone to act and to act quickly so as to prevent the loss of more and more human lives tomorrow  as yesterday  as a result of gunfire. The United Nations has already set out a basis for action with a view to a peaceful and equitable solution of the problem in that area. I have in mind particularly Security Council resolution 242(1967)  which includes relevant principles whose application offers guarantees of survival to each of the parties to the conflict. However that may be  my Government  reaffirming its attachment to the United Nations Charter and to that of the OAU  is categorically opposed to the acquisition and occupation of foreign territory by force.28.	The right of the people of Palestine to recover their national heritage has been recognized. In this regard  I should like to remind members  among other things  of the following: resolution 2535 B (XXIV)  in which the General Assembly reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people; resolution 2672 C (XXV)  in which the General Assembly recognized that the people of Palestine should be able to enjoy equal rights and the exercise of their right to self-determination under the Charter; resolution 2649 (XXV)  in which the General Assembly recognized the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination.29.	Those who with the complicity of certain great Powers are striving to maintain the status quo of the Palestinians and who trample underfoot the decisions of the international Organization are alone responsible for this crime against mankind.30.	If we have thought it our duty to associate ourselves with the desire of the Secretary-General to include in the agenda of our session the burning problem of terrorism  it is because we wanted it to be discussed and we wanted to see the facts clearly. We condemn international terrorism in all its manifestation  but I want to be properly understood. We absolutely exclude any idea of using this as a way of calling into question the legitimate activities of African liberation movements recognized by the OAU. Nor can there be any question for us of trying to wrest from the Palestinians their absolute right  which has been recognized  to recover their lost territory.31.	We must clearly define at this session the term ""international terrorism""  and we must also look for its causes and try to find objective solutions that would satisfy everyone. But let us not delude ourselves. This is indeed a complex problem.32.	The President of the French Republic  in his press conference of 21 September last  said:""Terrorism  to the extent that it affects everyone blindly  whether innocent or not  is something we condemn. But let us cherish no illusions; we shall not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not find some solution to the Palestinian problem. You cannot eliminate a phenomenon of this kind if you do not resolve the deep-seated cause of the phenomenon.""33.	If my delegation had noted any maneuver whatsoever designed to call into the question the activities of the valiant African freedom fighters recognized by the OAU  for example  then  of course  we would be obliged to reconsider our position. That is how I would like to explain the vote of the Chad delegation in favor of including on the agenda the item on international terrorism [item 92].34.	In South-East Asia bloody and murderous fighting is still going on and is destroying innocent and defenseless people. This annihilation has become a routine matter for the imperialist sadists  who for various reasons want to keep it going. In fact  these wars are no longer the exclusive affair of the parties directly concerned and confronting each other  but derive their causes from ideological intervention and a desire for hegemony. None of these reasons can meet with our approval  nor should they divert the attention of our Organization  for which no war can. be a matter of routine but must always be a matter of urgent concern.35.	The United Nations must demand from those who are the founding Members  but who do not hesitate to bring the Organization into ridicule  the complete and immediate cessation of the crimes which they have been committing for several years.36.	In the view of the Chad delegation  there are a few reasons that explain the persistence of world problems. Everywhere we see resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations that cannot be put into effect because it is not the will of any given Power in a given instance. Each Power is looking for its own victory outside the world Organization. Out of scorn for other States  all these Powers systematically trample underfoot our resolutions and recommendations  which are after all common solutions to common problems. Since it is so difficult for them to come to an agreement  their attempts to seek victory for themselves are vain' and futile. That is why  in Africa  Portugal  Vorster and Ian Smith have not yet given way to our international Organization. That is why in the Middle East Security Council resolution 242(1967) has so far remained unimplemented. That is why in South-East Asia  men  women and children continue to be incinerated every day.37.	We would also like to make some comments in the context of international economic development. There is one particular point I should like to make and this relates to the third session of UNCTAD  held in Santiago  Chile. At the opening of this session there was a feeling of hope. The poorer countries did indeed expect of it the adoption of a new concept of commercial solidarity in the international community. Our hope was based on the statements of the affluent countries  which we thought indicated their will finally to do something about the inequalities existing between them and the developing countries by undertaking to make a global effort to promote international trade and aid for development. But  unfortunately  nothing of the kind happened and there was only disappointment in store for us with regard to the conclusion of the Santiago Conference. Yet the Group of 77 developing countries had made the necessary arrangements to facilitate this global effort. But  in spite of all this  the regional and national selfishness of the developed countries won the day over international solidarity. Let us hope that at the fourth session of UNCTAD the undemanding of the affluent countries will spare us the evils now being suffered by the countries of the third world.38.	Although many world problems remain outstanding  the Government of the Republic of Chad notes with satisfaction the climate of detente which is to be glimpsed on some horizons renunciation of the use of force; limitation of the arms race; peaceful coexistence demonstrated on the one hand by the visits of the President of the United States to Peking and Moscow  and on the other  by the entry into force of the treaties between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and Poland  and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin. Those are facts which constitute the new kind of relationships which we are looking for between the peoples of the world and which have particularly marked the year 1972. That is not all. The year 1972 has witnessed a new trend in the relations between the two Korean Governments.39.	* The postponement at our previous session of a discussion of the question of Korea without any doubt contributed to the creation of a climate of eased tension between these two parties  and  believe me  if it had been otherwise  we would certainly not be witnessing the results we witness today. That is why my delegation considers that this year again the United Nations should welcome and encourage the efforts of the Korean Governments by refraining from doing anything which might jeopardize their negotiations.40.	I would be failing in my duty if  in conclusion  in the absence of U Thant  our former Secretary-General  I were not to pay the tribute to him which he is entitled to expect of us for all that he did during the difficult years when he faced  so honorably  various burning problems of all dimensions. On behalf of the Head of State  the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Francois Tombalbaye  Secretary-General of the Progressive Party of Chad  and on my own behalf  I would like to convey to him our very best wishes for very good health and happiness.41.	My Head of State has made it clear  with regard to the question of China  that that vast country is a partner which cannot be ignored in the world system of peaceful coexistence because it is a Power whose responsibility it should be to ensure a balance of power in the world. Through the delegation of China in this hall  we greet the Chinese people and Government.42.	The resolutions adopted by our National Congress in Sarh  in April of last year  recommended that we adopt a policy of an opening up of international relations. This is a concrete manifestation of the constant efforts of President Francois Tombalbaye  Secretary-General of the Progressive Party of Chad and Head of State.43.	With all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries the Government of my country would like to maintain cordial relations based on mutual respect for the principles of the charter of the OAU and of the Charter of the United Nations."
"111",6723,"TGO",27,1972,"May I be permitted first of all to express to the outgoing President  Mr. Adam Malik  our deep appreciation of the tact  the courtesy and the skill with which he conducted the work of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May we also assure him that he has our fullest admiration and best wishes.68.	I should like now to address to our President the warmest congratulations of the Togolese delegation upon his brilliant election to the presidency of this session. No one doubts that his intellectual qualities  his vast experience in international affairs and his profound attachment to the cause of our Organization carried much weight with this Assembly when it made its choice.69.	I could not fail to mention the eminent role played by our former Secretary-General  U Thant  who has left the powerful imprint of his personality on the life of our community. With respect to his successor  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  his designation by the twenty-sixth session was an inspiration which we applaud.70.	Since our new Secretary-General took over his functions we have had only reason to congratulate ourselves on the considerable qualities of which he has given proof. His spirit of initiative  his courage and his devotion to the cause of peace are a guarantee of renewed faith in our Organization  which at present is suffering from a crisis of confidence and whose difficulties escape no one.71.	We have the feeling that these real and disquieting difficulties cannot be solved unless all the nations represented here work as a united family. In this connexion  the restoration of China's rights in our community during the last session constituted an outstanding event and a realistic approach to the solutions we seek. The cause of peace cannot be defended effectively without realism  nor rendered a lasting service without justice. Therefore it is desirable to adopt the same mental attitude towards the other problems unfortunately  very numerous because any other approach  such as the one that prevailed until then  could only lead to a stalemate.72.	For many years in fact our Organization has been confronted with the same difficulties  the majority of which have not been satisfactorily solved  on account of the lack of the necessary spirit of sincere co-operation and political will. Must we henceforward infer that each year the sessions of the General Assembly will be no more than constant failures and oratory of the highest moral standing with no greater significance than the words of Cassandra? The consideration of questions which for many years have been on the agenda of our sessions provides some foundation for these apprehensions.73.	As regards the Middle East drama  the reciprocal attachment of Togo to both the Arab countries and Israel incites us to desire for that region a just and durable peace. To us the return to peace requires the honest implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We demand for each State in the area concerned the recognition and respect of its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. We believe that the will recently manifested by the Arab Republic of Egypt  which led to a certain military disengagement by that country  makes possible a compromise solution in the near future  and we sincerely hope that soon Arabs and Jews may coexist in peace in that part of the world.74.	We are especially appreciative of any attempt which seeks through dialog to smooth over the difficulties between the countries. Agreement is the basis of the policy of His Excellency General Etienne Eyadema  President of the Togolese Republic  to which all the Togolese people in good faith pay a deserved tribute and which today enables them to enjoy in newly found peace the virtues of unity and spiritual reconciliation. That is why we wish here publicly to congratulate Chancellor Willy Brandt on his resolute policy of detente in Europe and of rapprochement towards his brothers in Eastern Germany  a policy to which the whole world unanimously paid a tribute by conferring on him the Nobel Peace Prize.75.	We also rejoice at the attempt recently undertaken by the two Koreas to endeavor to solve their problems themselves. It is the duty of our Assembly to help to create favorable conditions for the reunification of that painfully divided country. In their effort to find an agreement the two Koreas may rest assured of the support and sympathy of Togo. We must keep in mind the idea that divided peoples will always seek at any price to restore the links that history has created between them and that fortuitous events have broken.76.	As regards the Far East  we must not overlook the fact that at this time whole peoples live in conditions comparable to those of the Second World War. We must make an effort to awaken from our torpor  from our guilty indifference in the face of the VietNamese problem. Thousands of innocent people are subjected to a cruel  merciless war  to deadly and indiscriminate bombardments. Our Organization must no longer remain aloof from this problem; it must encourage and support every attempt at a settlement inasmuch as it is  unfortunately  powerless to impose a cessation of hostilities. We are convinced that pressure from this Organization and from world public opinion in the long run will be a factor of peace in the IndoChinese peninsula.77.	The position of my Government with regard to the problem of decolonization has not changed. Togo unreservedly supports the struggle of Territories still under foreign domination to shake off the colonial yoke. It is regrettable to note that  despite the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 14 December 1960 [resolution 1514 (XV)]  Portugal continues to subject the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and Guinea (Bissau) to barbarous  racist and anachronistic occupation. With the complicity of certain Member States which claim to be friends of Africa  that under-developed country finds the means and has the audacity to attack and violate the territorial integrity of certain African States. We  the African countries  are resolved to provide the freedom fighters with the necessary moral and material aid to rid our continent of the scourge of Portuguese colonial domination. The last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  held in Rabat from 12 to 15 June 1972  abundantly showed  if need be  our unremitting determination to do so.78.	The problem of racism in Rhodesia and South Africa still constitutes a serious preoccupation for our Organization. In this connexion we must applaud the happy initiative taken this year by our Secretary-General. While the results achieved are not yet those we desire  we are nevertheless in duty bound to recognize that that mission was not entirely negative. Nevertheless  we must not be excessively optimistic  because the country of apartheid  which has not renounced an iota of its racist philosophy  has never taken much notice of the resolutions of our Assembly and shows an arrogant and absurd contempt for world public opinion. It is  however  to be hoped that common sense and realism will prevail in the end and that the racists of South Africa will understand that peace is not nurtured by continued expedients.79.	As regards Rhodesia  we are happy at the decision recently taken by the International Olympic Committee to refuse to allow that country to participate in the games in Munich  which we believe is in keeping both with the resolutions of our Organization and of the OAU. This irrefutably demonstrates that the loyal application by Member States of the sanctions promulgated against that country would represent an important step forward towards the solution of the Rhodesian problem.80.	My Government attaches great importance to the problem of disarmament. World peace and security cannot be safeguarded so long as controlled disarmament is not achieved. That is why we most strongly demand the convening  as soon as possible  of a world conference on this burning question  because the race in engines of death not only threatens world peace  but also uselessly deprives a large part of mankind of greater assistance for development.81.	At the beginning of the Second United Nations Development Decade  the major preoccupation of the developing world is still its economic development. Certain preliminary signs lead us to anticipate the possible failure of the main objectives embodied in the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade.82.	The first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  held in Geneva in 1964  defined great possibilities for action which aroused great and genuine hopes in our countries.83.	True  some very minor progress in 1968 can be credited to the second session of UNCTAD. But we must also acknowledge that in the absence of an international policy likely in the long run to improve the export earnings of the developing countries  the latter have registered only negative results as regards the expansion of their exports. Further still  last year's monetary crisis very seriously disrupted our already precarious economies  compelling us thus to assume the consequences of a situation for which we were in no way responsible.84.	The prospects of the third session of UNCTAD awakened in the poorer countries the hopes of which we are all aware. In fact  those countries were convinced that in the course of that important meeting the developed countries at long last would become aware of their responsibilities and would help them find appropriate solutions to their multiple development problems.85.	Once again  we must express our bitter disappointment at the results of the third session. Neither at New Delhi in 1968 nor at Santiago in 1972 were the developed countries willing to give proof of that indispensable solidarity that should normally bind the members of our international community  as laid down in tKe Charter of our Organization. Once again they regarded our just claims as mere children's whims and refused to grant any concession likely to offer the beginning of a solution to our economic difficulties.86.	Such an attitude is incompatible with the decision taken by those countries within the framework of the Second Development Decade. It is true that actually those countries  instead of subscribing to firm commitments  rather gave their marked preference to recommendations formulated in vague terms  without obligations or sanctions  as if to disengage themselves of any responsibility in a matter with which they no longer felt concerned. It is therefore not surprising that the poor or unfavorable treatment that the developed countries persist in imposing on our primary commodities on the world market contributes to a large degree to the continued deterioration in the terms of trade  thus depriving us of substantial export earnings indispensable for the balanced development of our economies. Our agricultural primary commodities encounter difficulties of every kind on the international market: marketing difficulties  instability of prices  competition from synthetics  and so on. Yet it is from these products that our countries draw their main resources.87.	It is high time for the international community seriously to tackle this problem  the solution of which is becoming urgent. For nine years the cocoa-producing countries have been awaiting the outcome of negotiationsthat should lead to the conclusion of an international cocoa agreement. In my country's economy this product holds a very important place  and the nefarious effects of its price fluctuations on our budgetary earnings can be readilyunderstood. Now that it would appear that all the technical conditions for an agreement exist  we address a pressing appeal to the consumer countries to show sufficient political will in order to arrive  as soon as possible  at theconclusion of an arrangement that will take into account the vital interests of the producer countries by guaranteeing tothem a just  remunerative and stable price.88.	The recent monetary crisis which created so much disruption throughout the world shows  if need be  the urgent necessity of reforming the international monetary system. We believe  as advocated by UNCTAD  that the new monetary system should  in the interest of the developing countries  help to create conditions in which the export trade of the developing countries could expand and diversify; could take into account a transfer of resources in an amount equivalent to that mentioned in the International Development Strategy  namely 1 per cent of the national gross product  and could include financial assistance abroad  the modalities of which could be established on the occasion of the restructuring of the system.89.	We reaffirm that it is through concerted international action  which would take into account the interests of all Member States and more especially those of the poorer countries in the international community  that an equitable and lasting solution could be found.90.	My country is gratified at the efforts of UNCTAD to help the least developed among the developing countries. The identification of these countries  we know  is no easy task. The Trade and Development Board has taken a decisive step by preparing a list of countries forming a nucleus. Continuing efforts must be made in order to define such criteria more clearly and to analyze them with greater objectivity and justice  while taking into account all the significant factors of under-development. We believe it necessary no longer to overlook the dynamic character of the life of States and to proceed to periodic stock-taking within the framework of the International Development Strategy. Only flexibility will ensure equity in this area.91.	My delegation could not fail to mention the results of the important United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm last June. We must become fully aware of the gravity of the problems posed by industrial pollution and recognize that it is one of the greatest scourges of modern times. But we must recognize that there is no greater pollution than the poverty  malnutrition  disease  racism  and so on  threatening the environment and two-thirds of mankind.92.	To national and temporary solutions  which perforce are insufficient and inoperative  we must prefer solutions at the world level.93.	We have no doubt that the serious problems of the environment with which we are at present confronted are the inevitable consequences of economic growth. However  these dangers inherent in scientific and technological progress must not prevent or delay the industrial development of our countries.94.	The fundamental principles enunciated in the Declaration of the Conference and in the various resolutions adopted at that Conference  are such as to serve as the basis for the preparation of adequate international measures  in conformity with the United Nations Charter and respect for human rights  with a view to helping the developing countries to take advantage of the industrialization possibilities they are offered while minimizing the risks of degradation of the environment.95.	My delegation approves the idea of the creation of an international institution and of a special Environment Fund. In our view this fund should be based on voluntary contributions and should be supported by taxes on the polluting industries. The wealthy countries must defray the cost of the protection of their environment and help the poor countries in their struggle against such problems while at the same time they should not reduce the assistance they provide.96.	The fundamental objectives provided for within the framework of the Second Development Decade will not be effectively achieved except through concerted action which  if effectively carried out  will undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of international peace and the establishment of a new economic order.97.	This new economic order is but an element in the new order that all countries  each year in this Assembly  call for with all their strength. For this dream to become a reality  all that is needed is the will and the spirit of solidarity  whose virtues everyone is so prone to acknowledge  of States in our community  particularly those whose wealth and power impose upon them special responsibilities for the maintenance of peace. But it is not necessary to succeed to persevere  according to a famous adage. But to persevere we must first begin. In other words  we must want change in order to achieve a more just and prosperous world for all."
"112",6769,"THA",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Thailand  I should like to extend to you our congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your dynamism  your experience in the negotiating field and your perseverance are among the qualities that will ensure the effectiveness of the present session. You indeed represent the finest attributes of the great Polish nation.35.	My delegation also wishes to pay a tribute to Dr. Adam Malik of Indonesia  the immediate past President  whose devoted services to the General Assembly have contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the twenty-sixth session.36.	The past 12 months have been replete with politically significant events in many areas of the world. Fortunately for the international community  these events and measures all have one aim that is  the reduction of world tensions. As the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is being convened  we may perhaps allow ourselves a little feeling of euphoria that prospects for international peace and security have been enhanced by last year's series of contacts  talks  agreements and treaties  both bilateral and multilateral. Whether or not this development will lead to the attainment of a durable peace is still a matter of conjecture.37.	The starting point for this eventful year a year of detente was no doubt the entry into the United Nations of the People's Republic of China during the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Since then  the People's Republic of China has been represented increasingly in United Nations organs and bodies. Its participation in all these meetings and more is yet to come has certainly added a new dimension to the discussions and deliberations on the complex issues facing the world. It is our belief that its involvement in international affairs has had and we are confident it will continue to have a salutary effect on the councils of the world.38.	One such beneficial effect was to move the world off dead center and to provide a momentum for further dialogs among those who had been in deadlock for too long a time on some bilateral and multilateral problems. Thus the new and positive relationship of the great Powers has slowly emerged.39.	The meeting of the leaders of the most powerful nation on earth  the United States of America  and the most populous nation  the People's Republic of China  helped to set the scene for other meetings of similar purpose. Relaxation of tension  bilateral or otherwise  seems to be the agenda of the day. While the concrete results of the conversations in Peking might have been limited and there was naturally no meeting of minds on the complex issues of war and peace  the fact that the meeting took place at all  and in a friendly and business-like atmosphere  was in itself a triumph of international understanding.40.	President Nixon's journey to Peking was followed closely by-another historic visit to Moscow. Here again  the leaders of the two mightiest Powers showed great statesmanship and a determination to create a more stable world. A string of agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the United States  affecting their respective security and economic interests as well as international peace and stability  could not but augur well for the future.41.	Elsewhere in Europe  additional steps  particularly a Treaty on Questions of Surface Transport  relating to Berlin  entered into by the divided States of Germany on 26 May 1972  to strengthen the fabric of peace in that continent  are also to be commended. Such measures gave an impetus to a trend which brought about an important agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland. It is our hope that this step-by-step process will generate sufficient confidence in the minds of European leaders and will eventually pave the way for the convening of a conference on European security.42.	In Asia  rays of hope have also appeared on the horizon. The tragic situation in the former East Pakistan  during which millions of people endured suffering and hardship  led to an armed conflict between India and Pakistan and resulted in the emergence of a new nation  the People's Republic of Bangladesh. While the birth of that nation took place in unhappy circumstances and the birth pains may be slow to heal  the existence of Bangladesh with its 75 million people  recognized by many nations  including Thailand  cannot be simply brushed aside. My delegation sincerely believes that in due course the statehood of Bangladesh will have to be given due recognition by the international community as a whole.43.	The war on the Indian subcontinent has left a bitter legacy to the people of the three countries. Yet there are increasing signs that the responsible leaders of Bangladesh  India and Pakistan have not lost sight of the realities of the situation and the advantages of eventual peaceful coexistence and co-operation in the region. Real problems  such as that of prisoners of war  still exist and will not be solved overnight  but  given the goodwill and understanding evidenced by the Simla Agreement of 3 July 1962  we are hopeful that they will be able  with renewed vigor and imagination  to overcome the obstacles and open a new era of peace and harmony in south Asia.44.	Indeed such vigor and imagination have already been detected in another part of Asia. The visit of the Prime Minister of Japan to Peking last week has helped to ease the strained relationship between the two countries which has existed for several decades. We hope that a new beginning has been made and the antagonism of long standing has now given way to better understanding and co-operation.45.	The recent opening of serious dialog in the Korean peninsula is to be welcomed by all peace-loving peoples of the world. The initiatives taken by the Red Cross societies of North and South Korea to discuss and arrive at a solution to the problem of divided families have won admiration from all quarters. It is the hope of the Thai delegation that the talks will be successfully concluded and their success will give an impetus to a future dialog on the questions of peace and security in the area and peaceful reunification of the divided country.46.	In this connexion  my delegation believes that the talks between North and South Korea should proceed in a tranquil and constructive climate  uninterrupted by outside interference and not sidetracked by discussions in other forums. It took the two sides more than 20 years to have direct conversations  and both should be given every encouragement and support  so that they may continue to rely on their own efforts to reach a political settlement. Any move in the United Nations  however well-intentioned  may have the unfortunate effect of disrupting the current talks or jeopardizing the prospects of a successful outcome of the meetings. It was  therefore  gratifying to my delegation that by a clear-cut majority the General Assembly decided  at its 2036th meeting  to defer consideration of the question of Korea to the next session.47.	There are  however  two other areas in Asia where the chances of attaining peace are still remote. The Middle East situation continues to be a source of grave concern. Troops in occupied areas have not been withdrawn. The Jarring mission appears to be at a standstill and to be in no position to break the deadlock which has existed for quite some time. It is  however  our hope that Ambassador Jarring will continue to pursue his efforts to bring the contending parties to a negotiating forum  taking full account of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The recent military activities on the ground have broken the precarious cease-fire which had been in effect for some time. The operations have  unfortunately  added another link to the chain of violence and reprisals  and the task of achieving peace with justice and security has been made more difficult.48.	The situation in South-East Asia also remains one which is fraught with danger. The invasion of South Viet-Nam by North VietNamese regular forces through the demilitarized zone last May has brought untold suffering to the people of South Viet-Nam. While the onslaught met with failure  the military operations had the effect of prolonging and enlarging the war  thus lessening the chances for a political settlement.49.	Laos and the Khmer Republic continue to be subjected to interference by outside Powers  and the presence and military activities of the North VietNamese regular troops against the legally constituted Governments of the countries are in violation of the United Nations Charter and relevant international agreements.50.	We in Thailand also have suffered from the terrorist and subversive activities which are supported  financed and directed by sources outside the country. It is  however  our earnest hope that those foreign sources will begin to see the wisdom and practicability of peaceful coexistence and co-operation on the basis of the principles enunciated at the African-Asian Conference  held at Bandung in 1955. Under such circumstances will the peoples of South-East Asia have a real opportunity to attain their common goal of turning that region into a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers. This objective embodies our long-term interest as perceived by the Governments of Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailand and enunciated in the Declaration of the Association of South-East Asia Nations [ASEAN] of 27 November 1971. It also represents our determination to bring about a relaxation of international tension and our desire to achieve a lasting peace in South-East Asia.51.	It goes without saying that  while wars continue to rage in the region  it is difficult to realize such a regional objective. On that basis  the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN at their last meeting in July agreed on a set of proposals and requested the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Dr. Adam Malik  to ascertain the reaction of the parties concerned.The results have not been forthcoming as we would have wished  but the efforts will be pursued relentlessly.52.	The magnitude of the internal and external problems of economic development has already been stressed by previous speakers. The widening gap between the rich and the poor countries has been mentioned time and again in this as well as in other forums. However  when it is recalled that the basic issues involved are so complex and vital to human welfare and progress  one realizes that repetition is unavoidable and even necessary.53.	The deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries continues to be aggravated by fluctuations in the prices of their basic exports and by inflationary pressures in some industrially advanced countries.54.	Further international efforts are needed also in improving access to markets for certain primary commodities. However  it is heartening to note that some industrialized countries have opened their doors to certain products from developing nations on an equitable basis. It is hoped that such doors will open even wider for further access to a broader range of products from the latter. After all  trade and not aid should be the primary concern of both developed and developing countries.55.	These and other problems were discussed at the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago  Chile  early this year. Although the meeting did not fully accomplish what it set out to do  it enabled the developing countries to reach a consensus on the direction in which they should proceed in order to achieve for themselves more equitable treatment and a larger share in the making of important economic decisions affecting their interests. The Conference at that session also provided them with the opportunity to air their legitimate grievances on such matters as shipping conferences  trade barriers that hinder their exports  the inadequate transfer of technology  and foreign control of their natural resources. The real and ultimate problem  however  remains one of translating the resolutions adopted at Santiago into action benefiting mankind. Much work still lies ahead of all of us  and we should all recognize that tangible achievements can only result from self-reliance and international co-operation.56.	The problems of economic development must be considered and their solutions found in the light of man's aspiration and need to live in a healthy and harmonious environment. My delegation notes with satisfaction the successful outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm and hopes that satisfactory agreement will be reached at the present session of the General Assembly on the various recommendations of the Conference. In the final analysis  the success of this tremendous venture lies in the hands of the Governments of the States Members of the United Nations themselves  for they alone have the political will and the power of decision necessary for the effective implementation of those recommendations.57.	The problems of economic development and the human environment are linked by a common factor  namely the desire of human beings to live a decent life. It is  therefore  patently clear that  as the world population grows  such problems become increasingly important as well as difficult to solve. It is fitting in this context to acknowledge the significant contributions made by the United Nations system to a better understanding of these related problems and to attempts to find solutions for them.58.	My delegation derives satisfaction from the progress made in the construction of the permanent headquarters for the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in Bangkok  Thailand. The formal ceremony to mark the laying of the cornerstone is scheduled to be held at the site on United Nations Day this month. The complex of buildings will also provide accommodations and facilities for the other United Nations offices situated in Bangkok.59.	The delegation of Thailand would like to reiterate its strong condemnation of the policies of apartheid and racial discrimination. It is a matter of grave concern that  despite continued manifestations of outrage by the world at large against such immoral practices  and despite repeated efforts on the part of the United Nations to achieve a just solution  little change can be expected in the near future. If this trend were permitted to continue  the area would undoubtedly become a hotbed of turmoil and conflict. Therefore  persistent endeavors by the international community are essential now to prevent such an event from happening in the future.60.	The efforts of the world Organization to fulfill the deep yearnings and legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Namibia  Southern Rhodesia and other parts of southern Africa have also failed to yield the desired results. It is indeed deplorable that the international will has been and continues to be frustrated  to the detriment of the people concerned. In regard to Namibia  it is to be hoped that the Secretary-General's laudable initiative on behalf of the international community will bring about a just solution in accordance with the United Nations principle of self-determination and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.61.	It has become increasingly apparent that international peace and security demand an early establishment of rules and guidelines governing the preparation and conduct of peace-keeping operations. In this important area where inactivity has lasted for too long a period  a solution has at last been found on the organizational questions affecting the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations. Since peace-keeping constitutes a principal function of the United Nations  the Thai delegation thus joins in appealing to the principal members of the Special Committee to demonstrate the necessary degree of co-operation and a spirit of accommodation and compromise in order to enable the Committee to perform its appointed tasks.62.	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is beset with a financial crisis which will affect the work of that Agency in alleviating the sufferings of the Palestine refugees  whose continued plight should be the concern of all human beings. In this connexion  the Government of Thailand was recently pleased to add its contribution in kind to the relief of these unfortunate people. We hope that ways and means will soon be found to enable the Agency to continue its humanitarian work with adequate financial support and without further fears of insolvency.63.	On the question of international terrorism  the Thai delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his initiatives in paving the way for an international discussion of this complex and multi- faceted problem. In deciding to take up the question  which has understandably given rise to differences of opinion  the Organization has focused the attention of the world on this important problem. My delegation is ready to participate in the consideration of the item on international terrorism with an open mind and all due objectivity.64.	The Thai delegation has consistently shared the widespread feeling of abhorrence at actions which endanger the safety of innocent aircraft passengers and threaten to reduce the benefits of modern air transportation. It wishes to reiterate its conviction that such actions are self-defeating in purpose and must be discouraged at all costs. Thailand is party to relevant international agreements  and it is taking further steps to strengthen its contribution to the international efforts against air piracy.65.	With the problems confronting the United Nations  my delegation takes comfort in the fact that our Organization has a highly dedicated and skilled diplomat as its Secretary-General. During the short time that has elapsed  his energetic efforts to try to solve the difficult administrative and financial problems of the Organization  which have had some encouraging results  have won our sincere admiration. His courage in facing up to certain other issues has invested his office with an aura of moral strength  and evoked our respect as well as our best hopes for the future of the United Nations. He has thus continued the fine tradition set by his predecessor  UThant  who has left a distinguished record of achievement and a countless number of friends among the members of this Assembly. My delegation's good wishes are extended to both U Thant and the Secretary-General for their continued good health and success."
"113",6930,"TUN",27,1972,"Mr. President  may I be permitted to greet you as the representative of a friendly nation which served as a model of resistance to all those who  refusing to surrender  followed your lead in the struggle for liberation. We greet you as a leader of that martyred people which  through blood and fire  carried endurance to the very extremes of human limits  and which  by fire and sword  vested the collective and individual dynamism of its sons with the traits of nobility  ethical values and the historic title of what at the time was already called the terrorism of the maquisards  although it was in fact your heroic resistance to the forces of evil. We also greet you as a witness of the;; barbarity and racism that dipped into the Warsaw ghetto to find fodder for the gas ovens. And finally we greet you as the incarnation of the triumph of the spirit of good over evil  a spirit whose manifestations and variations through the course of history have taken the form of nazism  colonialism and Zionism. None is better qualified than you to guide the difficult debates of the twenty-seventh session of this General Assembly with authority and serenity.20.	In our tribute we wish to include our distinguished colleague  President Malik  your predecessor. In so doing we also wish to salute the noteworthy steps taken by Europe in its policy of detente and security  and to hail at the same time the glimmerings of political detente  pale though they still may be  that are beginning to be visible in IndoChina and that give us hope that we may soon see dawn  and finally daylight in those countries of the rising sun that for decades have been plunged in the darkness of intolerance and domination. The qualities of heart and mind of both Mr. Malik and UThant  together with the will for change that was felt by all Members of our Organization  have already allowed us to restore the People's Republic of China to its legitimate rights and its rightful place in our Organization.21.	With you  Mr. President  and with Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our new Secretary-General  with what you represent in terms of imagination  strength of character and creativity  and in the light of the demands for change expressed without exception by all our colleagues-with greater or lesser success  with greater or lesser clarity  occasionally with a certain touch of weariness and concern  more indicative of frustration than rebelliousness  more indicative of a will to change than of sterile skepticism with you presiding over us  we expect even greater and better things than were accomplished by your predecessors  whose record showed positive accomplishments that do honor to them and to all of us.22.	How can we assist you in your efforts? What can we do amid all these recurring storms  in the face of all the obstacles and difficulties that crop up along your way  and despite the super-Powers that are not always helpful  despite the small and middle-sized nations as well that often take a defiant stand  and despite all the budgetary hindrances that go on forever and that add to the daily cares of our Secretary-General?23.	How  I say  can we help? As far as Tunisia is concerned  the way we can provide genuine and effective assistance is by making our modest contribution first of all by informing you of our feelings  of how we can see our world and its evolution  and by making it our duty to tell you what we believe to be just and true  without circumlocutions  without any trickery and at the risk of harming the feelings of some colleagues whom we have no reason to refer to and whom with your indulgence we beg  in advance  to pardon our statements to the extent that they believe that our comments are directed to them.24.	We have not come here as people go to an election meeting  to outbid each other  nor are we here as spectators in a theater who attend to support their champion or the star of the day. No  we have come with a desire mark my words-to conspire  in the best sense of the word  in the sense of Charles Maurras when he said  ""We conspire in order to decide upon a state of mind"". This state of mind we translate basically in the form of suggestions  proposals  follow-up action  enthusiasm  moral blows  those which put an end to coups d'etat and acts of force and which smash the barriers between men to smithereens  which propose other procedures  as for example in the case of the excessive use of the veto  whose survival in its present form runs counter to the spirit of our times and to the need for equity  harmony and fluidity that we all aspire to see prevail in human relations everywhere. True  the survival of the veto met the needs of the post-war period  immediately after that terrible war in which victory was won by the great Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union-and we reiterate our thanks and appreciation to them for that-these countries were granted the veto-and regretfully so-in order to reach agreement between themselves. However  the world has changed since then; other realities have been created  and therefore new forces and new problems and new requirements too  among which the defense of peace and of the United Nations like common sense become the task most widely shared today 25.	It is somewhat difficult for a man of our times to admit  as the practice of the veto would seem to imply and we may well be mistaken on this point that there are major nations and minor nations. We understand full well that each country carries its own specific weight with the authority and the ramifications flowing therefrom. The weight of the Soviet Union or of the United States has nothing in common with that of another less powerful country. Their contribution to the safeguarding  or for that matter to threats to peace  their contribution to aid and co-operation like their contribution to the daily life of our Organization cannot be compared.26.	We do not propose expressly to do away with the right of the veto  but rather to consider the number of countries that should perhaps eventually exercise that right as well as how to moderate the exercise of the veto so that its use will more validly and effectively serve the common objectives of our Organization. We propose that in any consideration of this issue  or in any research that we may call for  heed will be taken of this trend towards democratization  to which most of my colleagues have referred here-and how many cogent  pertinent and deeply felt and pondered things often expressed in eloquent terms have been said from this rostrum  or will be said during the debate on this issue!27.	If today this current of change through democratization appears more and more widespread and increasingly imperative it is precisely because it encompasses realities and truths which have emerged slowly  gradually and sometimes almost unnoticed both in the shadow of the United Nations  as well as with the help of the United Nations. The realities  these truths that are entangled together today-and which appear complex-we believe fall into two main categories. The first category of comments would cover what we might call the already established and accepted order. The second category would contain what is in the process of being  developing  seeking the trend towards a new order.28.	In what is established  in what already exists  we have a stage dominated by two great actors with a reservoir of economic force and power  and technological  political and military strength that has never been equaled in the history of mankind. Because of their decisive contribution to the victory over the Axis Powers  because of the many and specific circumstances that had divided them  ideologically  politically  economically and strategically but  fortunately never militarily  and also because of the remarkable competition they have waged in space exploration research and science and  finally  because of the balance of atomic terror that they have had the wisdom to respect  so that today we know a balance of caution  those two Titans have monopolized the international diplomatic chess game which was only natural-by taking a wise initiative here  getting involved in a misguided move there and often this would lead here  there or elsewhere to trends that finally turned into acts of hegemony or faits accomplis. Thus the super-power of one or another of the Titans is very often projected thousands of kilometers beyond the borders of its own territory. The will to control  through economic or technological means  through military bases and by means of the fleets that plough the seas and oceans and we have some first-hand knowledge of this in the Mediterranean by sophisticated weapons and even by war itself: all these attest to an excessive tendency to hegemony. All these acts  whether innocent on the surface or overtly aggressive  have been characteristic of the international situation  and still are today. So much for what already exists and is obvious  that which we might call the order of hegemony.29.	Regarding the second type of comment  you have man's desire to be free  strengthened by the wave of decolonization movements which in a torrent of fresh  new ideas bubbles with enthusiasm and new values and seeks its equilibrium in a new order.30.	We wonder if  with time and with the will of men to free themselves  which like the sea is ever-renewed  the order that was created in the aftermath of the Second World War is not being affected today by the evolution in these orders  some of which we read about in history  such as Athens  Carthage and Rome in particular and which crumbled as a wall weakened by time and adversity crumbles. Colonial Europe had already had its experience  which could have been much more painful were it not for the healthy reactions of some enlightened minds such as Mendes-France and General de Gaulle to whom we are pleased to pay a tribute  men who having learned the lessons of history  were able to find in their culture  in their past and in their patriotism the necessary strength to avoid their country's suffering a decline in its influence and to transform a sense of exhaustion into a new  galvanizing breath of life which became a fountain of co-operation and mutual assistance.31.	I would restate from this rostrum the question solemnly posed by President Habib Bourguiba at the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  which met at Rabat in June  when he spoke of whatever still survives as the shameful remnants of colonialism and when he also addressed himself to all those in Europe who want to put an end to colonialism. He said:""Is it possible to consider that the European Community  inspired by the example of France  Belgium  the Netherlands and Great Britain  which have all decolonized more or less successfully  will find the ways and means that will permit Portugal"" a country which is bogged down in a sorry business and which  since it is a Mediterranean country should be able to rely on our means of assisting it to decolonize ""to repatriate its last soldier  its last settler  while reserving to itself a place and a status still to be defined in the European Community? ""We believe that is the only peaceful way to put an end to the bloodshed. It seems to us that this is the road we must follow in seeking what has been termed a dialog; furthermore  this would perhaps be the only form of useful dialog which could generate further dialogs that may mark the beginning of a new era  an era of reconciliation among Europeans  an era of friendship between Europeans and Africans  and lastly an era of solidarity among all men in a single order which must be worked out and put into force. Europe  having regained its rightful form  should deal with this problem—Europe which symbolizes man and his dignity and freedom  man being in our opinion the means and source and end of all action  man  the brother of all men that Europe we hail more as a force for research and investigation  as a potential element of decolonization  as a new force working for a new equilibrium  rather than a Europe committed like the super-Powers trying to set up a new hegemony.32.	Just as we welcome the demands for peace  progress and peaceful change which are emerging in Asia  Africa and Latin America  so do we consider encouraging the impressive efforts to enter and participate actively in international life made by great industrialized countries  Tanaka's Japan  Trudeau's Canada  and Australia  so bubbling with energy and industry at home  and heretofore acting in such a discreet manner beyond its frontiers. All these countries have lent an attentive ear to the third world and their minimum requirements for a decent life.33.	How can we also overlook the impressive and important role assumed by the People's Republic of China  fascinating and mysterious China  only yesterday outside the Organization and today impressive in its dialectics  force and new virtues. In the trends developing towards a new balance  the history  geography  the dimensions and genius of the Chinese people  the wisdom and seriousness of its leaders  their obvious readiness to abide by the rules of the game in their international relations  no one can doubt and all this evidence leads us to believe that the People's Republic of China  with its tremendous active assistance  hopes to inject a breath of fresh air  signal a fresh approach and make a substantial contribution towards the development of a new public spirit  dedicated to the cause of peace and progress  in other words  to the strengthening of our Organization.34.	Thus we believe that the hegemonic order of the post-war period cannot be maintained as rigidly as it has been  with this tendency to monopolize the fund of knowledge  will and power  while aspirations to diversify  to introduce fluidity  complementary relationships  harmony and a new balance are becoming more evident day by day.35.	Everywhere we hear voices which must be heeded as a fact of life  expressing refusals and challenges  refusals to condone domination  occupation and aggression  challenges to control and manipulation from afar. On all sides and even within the hegemonic order we hear the same demands being voiced: we want to be free  really free  politically and economically  free to enjoy our culture  free to enjoy our ethos. We would like to recreate man  cure him. We want to bring man to man.36.	True  this is still only a plea  a cry  but it is a significant plea and a somewhat prophetic cry. History has heard cries which have finally set men and events on a new course  and each time a new and better order has finally seen the light of day and each time mankind has taken a giant step forward  towards more justice  freedom and progress. The process is a familiar one. Appeals in various forms come from the humblest of our people  which set forth pressing needs  confirm trends and help to revitalize the fabric of international relations by bringing men closer together  reducing antagonisms and strengthening the obligation to achieve detente and solidarity.37.	It is significant to note that the war which has been ravaging the peoples of IndoChina  particularly the Vietnamese  even in all its most terrible and ghastly aspects which are repugnant to all who love justice and freedom  has made a significant contribution to a degree of detente between Washington and Peking and to a greater understanding between Moscow and Washington. It is unfair that the valiant people of Viet-Nam-which was one of the first to take up arms to win its freedom  which has contributed so significantly to the decolonization movement  and which continues to contribute despite  or perhaps because of  its present suffering  indirectly to encourage a detente between Washington  Peking and Moscow-it is unfair  I say  that his people should be the last to taste the fruits of peace when it was the first to act to achieve peace by dint of its struggle for its own independence  for the dignity of the peoples of the third world and  to a certain extent  for international detente.38.	We are saddened by the fact that the great American nation  our friend of all time  should be waging a most atrocious war against the valiant people of Viet-Nam  to which we are linked by so many ties and with whose Government we have already decided to establish diplomatic relations  although our ideologies and political systems differ.39.	Is it not encouraging to note that  because of our demands to both sides for development  because of our quarrels  our tensions and our wars  and thanks to our desire for non-alignment and co-operation  we who belong to the group of smaller and medium-sized nations do in fact constitute in the eyes of the great Powers just so many forces of opposition which must be reckoned with  just so many channels of communication which cannot easily be ignored  just so much new blood that feeds the tissues of international life  just so many currents of feeling and also just so many sources of pressure applied to the superPowers and calling upon them to strengthen their understandings with one another  to encourage the dialog between their own proteges  their clients and friends  and  finally  to resign themselves to a more balanced and equitable reorganization of the world.40.	Let us pay a tribute to our Secretary-General for his comment of great historic significance  in the introduction to his report:""The interests  the wisdom and the importance of the vast majority of medium and smaller Powers cannot  at this point in history  be ignored in any durable system of world order."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 2.]Does that not refer to the type of order being sought in this trend towards democratization  and the drive for freedom?41.	We hope  and in fact we believe  that the hegemonic order set up at the end of the Second World War is in the throes of transformation  that it is being transmuted into an immense wave of solidarity and universal co-operation just as colonial Europe has evolved and worked towards the type of entity it is today: an assembly of desires and strength which is being built up to ensure security and co-operation among the Europeans themselves and to promote solidarity and mutual assistance with others.42.	It is in this direction  it is for this new reign of man  for this new community more concerned with the quality of man's life than his level of living  a more generous or in other words a more just and fraternal community  that this Organization can do a great deal.43.	We know that this new community  this new balance  will not be achieved through any wave of a magic wand. Instead it will be the result of the long and difficult meditation  organization and efforts undertaken by the specialized agencies  intergovernmental as well as non-governmental organizations  regional organizations and the various manifestations of the attitude of the non-aligned countries  a group of countries to whom we should like to pay a tribute for their unremitting efforts and the sound work they have done.44.	The old cliches are becoming increasingly threadbare and shopworn. The old concepts of East and West  capitalism or communism  class struggle  management  collectivism  liberalism  republic  monarchy  all are concepts that have generated misunderstandings and squabbles with regard to which we must be reconciled as a matter of urgency so that we can devote ourselves to the sole task of solidarity and mutual assistance with a clear understanding of the options  it being clearly understood that any economic systems that are going to be adopted are deemed to be tools in man's service  the only objective that counts.45.	Following U Thant  our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has forcefully raised the key questions confronting mankind which the United Nations can and should be resolved in the next few years by setting aside our quarrels and giving the impetus necessary to a fairer and more balanced type of growth.46.	If we  rich and poor  are aware that our world may become physically uninhabitable  that man's life is in mortal danger  that our planet seems too small to cope with the growth of population and its needs  why is this pressing feeling of solidarity not given top priority  so that it can be channeled and organized in the form of plans and instruments for effective  planned programs of work?47.	The problems of the environment haunt the highly industrialized nations; the question of population growth is the particular obsession of the poor nations; and the problems raised by certain aspects of technological and scientific development  such as communication by satellites  are of concern to those who cannot have them and who therefore must be satisfied with the information  guidance  and slogans which the possessors of communications satellites may wish to broadcast to them. All of these problems are really of concern to each and every one of us as a community.48.	Is it not high time therefore for us resolutely to tackle these problems in the spirit of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment  held at Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972  and in accordance with the recommendations of the World Bank and the various specialized agencies that deal with development as well as-and this should be our primary aim-by redoubling consultations and agreements  by questioning one another and by .exchanging the results-of our experiences first at the regional organizational level and then at the level of our own United Nations.49.	Unfortunately  in our community dangerous contradictions persist and tensions are constantly being renewed. I am thinking of the Israeli-Arab confrontation on Palestine  the racial confrontation between blacks and whites in Africa  the confrontation between Greeks and Turks over Cyprus and the confrontation between brothers in the Indian subcontinent. I am thinking of all these aberrant pressures which threaten to jeopardize all our efforts and searching to achieve a more balanced world.50.	I am frankly and sincerely wondering whether  outside the maneuvers of the great Powers  sheltered from their games of what was yesterday the cold war and is today the hot detente  if left to ourselves  to our common will for freedom  justice and progress  we might not be able to overcome our differences through dialog and communication  seeing what each one discovers or develops and seeking to bring together those things which fit together  to bar what divides us and to compose the living synthesis that will help to solve our problems and to sustain our public spirit  in other words  our necessary solidarity.51.	With your leave  Mr. President  in this spirit I should like to address myself to Mr. Abba Eban and I am sorry that he is not in the seat where he ought perhaps to have been who spoke here on the situation in the Middle East. I should like to mention the situation in the Middle East  which  if it grows worse  may destroy the people and the countries of one of the most sensitive regions on this planet 52.	For half a century Zionists and Arabs of Palestine and elsewhere have been in a state of war tension  one side defending its latest conquests  the other awaiting its imminent revenge  alternating between arrogance and hatred-the Palestinians  the Arabs  repelled but not vanquished  and the Israelis  carried on the waves of their weapons and their myth but not victorious  continue in the face of the uncertainty of the future  to brood on violence and to generate despair  create an impasse and  as a consequence  brew terrorism and its blind effects. In the past it was the Israeli organizations of the Irgun and the Stern gang; today it is the Palestinian organizations like the Black September group.53.	While words evolve as do men and reality  it is significant that when dealing with the problems of the Middle East we are open to suspicion if we do not use certain language. We are constrained to use certain words as we use a particular currency  a currency battered by years of war  a currency that serves only to deal in hatred  a counterfeit currency that nevertheless continues in use and distorts discussion  deceiving men and falsifying events.54.	Let us not forget that in this region  where the heavens joined the earth to fertilize it with grace  rivalries have long existed and still exist  misinterpreting the spirit  committing crimes against men and sacrilege against God. In each undertaking and at each stage of a proposed solution  the density  intensity and complexity of the problem become apparent. Thus  the methods used and the very approach to the problems involved run amok when they touch that sensitive region of the world; they may seem in disarray  always impassioned  often skin deep  and sometimes they are more metaphysical and mythical than real.55.	It is also true that the Arab nations give an impression of chaos  with extreme affluence in some countries and extreme poverty in others accompanied by the annoying tendency of turning to the great Powers to seek openings or protection to support their quarrels  or perhaps to protect themselves against fate. It is equally true that the great Powers believe they can assure their domination by having proteges or clients  and today we see evidence of this in that the great Powers take each other's measure and gage themselves through ""small country"" intermediaries  while at the same time they get rid of their surplus outmoded weapons or try out new so-called conventional weapons on them.56.	While it is true that in the past  the Arab countries racked up mistakes and stalemates it is equally true that their camp today is the camp of reason  loyalty and the will to self-determination as a result of the operations of the rules of the international game.57.	Let people have the honesty to note and say that it is Israel's lack of reasonableness which blocks the decisions of the United Nations and develops a sort of dialectics of despair that pushes some persons to commit the reprehensible folly of hijacking civil aircraft and others to mortgage the development of their countries by devoting the largest portion of their moneys and their abilities to weapons  and still others to change regimes by a coup d'etat  for lack of the power to change the course of events and the present system which oppresses them now and blocks their prospects for the future.58.	The Arab nations of the. Middle East and the Palestinians have never felt as oppressed  as misunderstood and as hedged in as they do today. The Jews of the Warsaw ghetto could have  would have  understood this  The world could have  should have  understood this. For the people of Palestine  while the worst is never certain  the better life seems always to recede farther and farther from their grasp.59.	Yet in Israel's position there is such a margin of unreasonableness  so much excessive arrogance and defiance  such a will to flout the United Nations  its Secretary-General  its Security Council  its General Assembly  its various organs  the four great Powers and each Member State that all of this is more than enough to remove mountainous barriers of indifference and ""hands-off"".60.	That the great Powers  who are otherwise so touchy about matters of pride and prestige  have allowed the authority of the United Nations and public spirit to be degraded to such an extent is really food for thought; this is shocking  and where Israel is involved  this is what is the last thing to be expected. When Israel is involved or when it is a question of South Africa and Rhodesia  some great Powers forsake the United Nations and its moral authority floats away and depreciates like any common currency. But the fact that the Israelis behave as they do to the United Nations  which brought Israel into being in 1947 by arbitrarily imposing it on the Palestinians in a land that was  it is true  under British mandate but which had its own nationals  the Palestinians -Moslems  Christians and Jews- and the fact that the Israelis  the favorite children of 1947  today consider the United Nations as the graveyard of aborted resolutions and this was said quite clearly while the Arabs  yesterday's victims  agree to abide by the recommendations and the resolutions of the United Nations  these facts speak volumes about the evolution of the thoughts and habits of both sides. In the case of the Israelis  I cannot help thinking of that group of nursing infants  of whom Montaigne spoke  crammed full  spoiled and plump  who spit in their mothers' face and spit out their bile in the faces of those who watched them being born  in the faces of those who assisted at their birth.61.	Allow me to say to Mr. Eban  whose ability is equal to his oratory: you know  Mr. Eban  that we in Tunisia feel no hatred towards you. You know how the Jews live in Tunisia. You know that in our Parliament there is even a Jewish Tunisian parliamentarian of whom we are proud. If we tell you this it is because we are sincere in our thinking and because we feel very deeply what we see. Neither we nor the Palestinians whom you despoiled of their country and their homes and whose national cause you relegate to the status of the eternal refugee problem  to a minor squabble  nor the Arabs whose land you seized  nor the Christians  nor the Moslems towards whom you became guilty of violence when you continued to attack Jerusalem have any resentment of you as a Jew or as an Israeli. Thanks to the conduct of President Bourguiba we make a constant effort to do away with hatred which stifles all growth  to avoid bypaths which lead us astray  and to set aside false warlike attitudes which only inflame the mind.62.	""What about Munich? "" you will say. Let us speak then of Munich. Let us speak of the facts and the true sequence of events. Munich  transformed for a time into the Olympic capital of the world after having been one of the citadels of nazism Munich where the champions took each other's measure and competed free from political and military passions  a few Palestinians felt they had to go to Olympic Village from which  as you know  they were excluded as they are excluded from all international affairs  and where  among others  the flag of Israel flew in the place and in the stead of the one that in their view should have been there: the Palestinian flag. They succeeded in taking certain distinguished Israeli champions as hostages in order to exchange them for some common fedayeen. To be sure  the practice of taking hostages is detestable at all times and even more detestable when the athletic stadium is chosen as the field of operations. But and I apologize for speaking parenthetically-I would merely observe in passing that I am not sure that this practice of taking hostages is not followed very often today in Gaza  in Jericho  in Jerusalem and in the holy places of the Moslems  Jews and Christians  but we won't talk about that today. So far nothing tragic had happened in Munich. Certain cold minds  trained  perhaps  in the computer schools and inspired by the gods of sport  probably even talked about a sporting performance. The Palestinians even said that they might take the Israeli champions to Tunisia  They even telephoned a Jordanian personality living in Tunisia  probably to stress  and rightly so  that  despite the black September repression of the Palestinians by the Jordanian authorities  the brotherhood between Palestinians and Jordanians still existed. But it was not up to the Tunisians  nor the Jordanian personage  nor the Palestinians  nor  I believe  their Israeli hostages  to organize the reception in Tunis for this extraordinary cargo of the strange visitors. Had they come to us  they would of course have been well received  and we would have undertaken a dialog with you calmly  convinced  as we always are  that it is better to talk  to exchange views  than to bomb and kill. The opening of a direct dialog between us on this subject would even have been more fruitful. It might have become a starting point; it might even have allowed the two irreconcilable antagonists  the Palestinian fedayeen and those who are called the Israeli hawks  to start a debate  to open up prospects for the future  and even to envisage certain solutions. In short  we would have talked  and no one knows exactly what might have happened.63.	Mr. Eban  it is most regrettable to have to tell you  who have always called sincerely for a dialog  according to information and indications we have  that it was you not you  personally  or course  but you  the Israeli leaders who insisted upon killing  instead of speaking to  the fedayeen.64.	Does this mean that you would speak to other Arabs  but that you plan to kill Palestinians directly or through a particular other European country or by Arab countries  who themselves are intermediaries  whom you often call upon to contribute to your security by asking them to liquidate Palestinians with the threat of terrorizing them  as you have recently done in Syria and in Lebanon.65.	Mr. Eban  mark these words:""A few months ago  I said what I thought about Palestinian terrorism. I spoke out freely. Inevitably  you provoke terrorism when you reduce fanatical believers in a just cause to a hopeless situation.""But the people I am talking about are not terrorists. They are simply martyrs. They will die with their weapons in their hands as heroes  as did the martyrs of the Warsaw ghetto. Like the Christian martyrs in the Coliseum  they have no weapon but their faith  but their decision to stand without flinching and accept the supreme sacrifice. In making this act of faith  this willingness  this act of will to sacrifice themselves  they are not humbled; they grow in stature. True  the Palestinian problem still stands in all its complexity. Rebellion cannot solve it. Terrorism will not solve it. Obstinate repression cannot solve it either. This problem  like so many others  is now in the lap of the United Nations.""This delay has already cost too much suffering and created too much hatred. In Palestine  as in the rest of the world  we must have peace  and there is no lasting peace unless it is a just peace ""Why does that Government stubbornly maintain its position? I know it is not its responsibility alone  and that more or less consciously or unconsciously  almost all the Governments of the world and the United Nations itself have at one time or another been its active or passive accomplices in this ghastly drama of Palestine. Why fall into recrimination? We must put an end to this. The universal appeal for justice is irresistible. We must ask mercy on these unhappy persons who  after so many tribulations and sufferings  legitimately and naturally seek the refuge of a homeland  their homeland. It is natural that in emerging from so many trials they dream of an asylum in a land which would be theirs  where they would find themselves among their equals with other free men and where they might at last be able to count on breathing  working and seeing their children grow up in a secure and brotherly atmosphere.""That is my position. I never touch on this question without some qualms. I ardently hope that circumstances will allow this to be the last time I have to deal with this matter.""66.	Mr. Abba Eban  all those noble words are not mine. They are not the words of an Arab  some impassioned speaker or some stranger. They are the words of a great man  a great mind-dead now. You know that. You know all this  but perhaps you do not know whose words they are. I have said they were the words of a great man—Leon Blum. I have quoted them at length because they very clearly express the views of the Palestinians of today  having in their day expressed the feelings of the Jews of the Exodus in 1947. These words were written in 1947.67.	So  Mr. Eban  you see the danger that hangs over you  that threatens us all  is perhaps your tendency not to see facts as they are and not to link them with the future  and above all to keep from thinking about the future as clearly as Leon Blum did and as he asked others to do. Or perhaps you think of it too narrowly. You are keeping yourself down  torturing yourself by not wanting to change  by forbidding yourself to move  by setting yourself up  by stiffening your posture in formalism and the mold of procedure. By holding occupied territories as a direct surety  by creating a fait accompli elsewhere  by encouraging flight in other areas  by organizing the repression of Palestinians everywhere  you obtain for yourself  for us all and for the region a guarantee of unhappiness in the future.68.	Have you not thought that hatred is now reaping its twenty-fifth harvest? That in the course of three wars were fought and won  all the Palestinian families were dismembered  dispersed  separated and strained and many other Arab families as well. And how many seeds of revolt have been sown in the region? What scale of values do you speak of? To what precedents do you refer? Tell us if you are ready to leave Jerusalem. Are you ready to accept a Palestinian homeland  a Palestinian State. Tell us what form of coexistence with the Palestinians you choose  and precisely what frontiers you would like. Are you for these objective arrangements for peace?69.	Mr. Eban  we believe you are sincere in what you say  and it is that that concerns us so much  because we must then wonder if in the final analysis it is in your regime's nature to be able to make peace. Above all do not say that the Arabs  the Palestinians themselves  avoid dialog aimed at peace. Propose valid conditions for peace and you will be astonished by the sense of responsibility and the constructive spirit of the most intransigent of the Arab leaders  including the Palestinians.70.	In a state of war there can be talk only of war.71.	I apologize for having spoken heatedly and at such length. However  when we see the international situation evolving and among the shadows  there are pale glimmerings of light. The United States is engaged in useful dialogs with Peking and Moscow and even with Hanoi in order to reduce tension in the world. When we consider that the thorny question of Berlin is solved; when we see Germany and its neighbors embarking on a process of co-operation; when  finally  we see European countries working together to try to achieve a fresh climate of confidence and security among themselves; when the international community becomes more and more insistent in its demand for peace  it is a shame to note that there still exist vestiges of colonial era  racism or even Zionism  casting their shadows over the map of Africa or parts of the Middle East.72.	Sooner or later the frontiers of disapproval and isolation will close round these islands of hatred and racism. May this wish become a message  the one which resounds in Jerusalem  that of the one God  the God of the Jews  the Christians and the Moslems  calling men  all men  to brotherhood and concord. We will be worthy of Jerusalem  God  man  the United Nations and ourselves if we work to make this message a reality."
"114",6977,"TUR",27,1972,"May I begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. The historical ties between my country and Poland add to my satisfaction at seeing you presiding over this Assembly. We feel sure that your high qualities and wide experience will be a valuable asset to the success of our deliberations.45.	I wish also to express our appreciation and gratitude to our former President  Mr. Adam Malik  for the excellent job he did throughout his tenure of office. I am sure that this great Assembly will continue to benefit from his wisdom and experience.46.	This is the first occasion I have had to address the General Assembly since the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt WaMheim  assumed his high office. I have had the privilege of co-operating with him for many long years and I should like to convey my sincere appreciation of his outstanding performance of his task  which is dedicated to peace and to the attainment of the ideals of the United Nations. I wish him all success in his future endeavors.47.	I should like also to welcome Under Secretary-General Morse and to wish him well in his new duties.48.	Our agenda is weighted as usual with items of crucial importance. Our world continues to be troubled by many centers of strife  conflict  instability and unhappiness. Many dangerous problems await speedy and just solutions. On the other hand  some recent developments lead us to believe that  for the first time since the end of the Second World War  we may well be on the threshold of a qualitatively different era of international relations. So before I elaborate on the prospects we can hope for  permit me to dwell briefly upon some of the major problems which confront us.49.	Although so many years have elapsed since the cease-fire in the Middle East  we note regretfully that the settlement which would end the plight of the peoples of this region is still to come. We maintain the view that Security Council resolution 242(1967) contains all the necessary elements for bringing about a just and durable solution of this problem. Having consistently supported Ambassador Jarring's mission  we observe with satisfaction the realistic and constructive attitude taken in this respect by some of the directly interested Arab States. We believe that this approach should not only be put to good use but should also be followed by the other parties to the conflict.50.	The establishment of a just and durable peace should naturally safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned. But we feel that such a peace cannot be founded on the acquisition of political or territorial advantages through the use or threat of force. We have always insisted that the status of Jerusalem  a holy city for three major religions of mankind  should not be changed by unilateral action.51.	As regards developments in the subcontinent  we think that the favorable atmosphere created at the Simla meeting between the leaders of Pakistan and India should be utilized for further agreements. The speedy restoration of peaceful conditions  stability and co-operation in the region will undoubtedly be in the interest of all concerned.52.	In this respect I should like to emphasize particularly the fact that the predicament of prisoners of war constitutes a great cause for concern. We believe that for political  legal and especially humanitarian considerations these prisoners of war should be repatriated as soon as possible  in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and with due regard to the United Nations resolutions.53.	The abhorrence with which Turkey views colonialism and racial discrimination is too well known to need stressing. Suffice it to say that my country was one of the sponsors of the historic Declaration on decolonization  and occupies for the third time the office of President of the United Nations Cou  oil for Namibia.54.	Today 28 million people still live under colonial rule. The worst cases of this anachronism continue to prevail in parts of the African continent  where no substantial improvement has been recorded in the past year. The only exception to this tragic situation is the chain of rather hopeful developments in connexion with Namibia  such as the visit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations from 6 to 10 March 1972 and the appointment of his representative  on the recommendation of the Security Council in its resolution 319 (1972).55.	Turkey  which takes a great interest in the questions of Africa in general and in the problems of decolonization in particular  was pleased to receive this year the members of the United Nations Council for Namibia  as well as a delegation representing the OAU under the chairmanship of Mr. Moktar Ould Daddah  the President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. The exchange of views in Ankara served to illustrate once again the understanding which so happily exists between Turkey and the African countries.56.	The world community today is being wantonly and needlessly torn apart by a new form of violence. I refer to acts of international terrorism ranging from the hijacking of aircraft to the kidnapping and killing of innocent people. The frequency with which these events have been taking place in recent times and the tragic consequences they have brought about have created a general feeling of insecurity in the daily conditions of normal life and have proved that national actions to prevent them must be complemented by measures at the international level. Turkey favors all positive and sensible initiatives in this direction. However  in coping with this urgent problem and in order to be just and effective all care should be taken to ensure that acts of terrorism per se do not become the object of political exploitation one way or another. International political issues and criminal acts should be kept in their respective domains and dealt with accordingly.57.	We agree with our Secretary-General when he says that the underlying situations which give rise to violence and terrorism should be considered simultaneously. While on this subject I should like to point out the emergence of a new kind of subversive terrorism directed from abroad and aimed at undermining the national independence  unity and territorial integrity of States. Yet we all know that under the Charter of our Organization each State has the right to choose freely its economic  social and political system and we cherish this freedom to determine our national affairs. It is all the more regrettable that the acts to which I refer are directed against countries which follow a policy of peace  entente and co-operation  abide faithfully by the Charter of the United Nations and practice tolerance and good will in their international relations. If we are sincere  as we should be  in our desire to strengthen international peace and security  to promote co-operation and concord and to develop further the climate of detente  the international community should not remain indifferent to those subversive acts  which are flagrant and dangerous violations of the Charter and the decisions of the General Assembly. It has never be forgotten that sincerity and good faith should not be just empty words but should always be truly respected in civilized intercourse among nations and that resort to double standards ultimately leads to chaos. 58.	May I now turn to some of those hopeful developments which at least indicate that the international firmament is not entirely clouded. It is a source of satisfaction for us to see two great nations of the Asian continent  China and Japan  bridging the differences and inaugurating a new era in their relations. South and North Korea have initiated negotiations for peaceful unification. We earnestly hope that their efforts will be crowned with success. On the other hand  we welcome the talks which are going on between East and West Germany. We see in them a further contribution to the process of detente and expect that they will yield positive results in the near future. In the field of disarmament the SALT agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  constitutes a landmark. We are also on the eve of a conference which is to take up the disarmament question on a global basis. We believe that  in the preliminary work of preparation for this conference  not only the great military Powers but also States belonging to different regions and having special strategic positions should participate. Considering that such a conference may be a turning-point in human history  in mankind's age-old dream of peace  Turkey nourishes very high hopes for it and attaches great importance to its being held after the completion of all preparations necessary for its success.59.	Another forthcoming event of major importance for peace is the prospective conference on European security and co-operation. Turkey's attitude towards this conference is similar to its attitude towards the conference on disarmament. That is to say  Turkey welcomes it wholeheartedly; places great hopes in it; wishes to see it completely successful; and for that very reason wants full preparation.60.	As was stated by my delegation from this rostrum last year [1954th meetingJ  political agreements alone cannot meet all the requirements of security. They need to be complemented by a lowering of the level of the military forces which confront each other. It is this necessity that has bred the concept of mutual and balanced force reductions. As durable peace can only come about through real security  I would like to stress once again the undeniable and inescapable link between the military and political aspects of the forthcoming conference.61.	Now I wish to say a few words on the question of Cyprus  which is of direct interest to my country. It is known that on the basis of the suggestion of the Secretary- General  the inter-communal talks in Cyprus have been resumed in an enlarged form.  Turkey has always been in favor of finding a peaceful and permanent solution for the Cyprus question based on' the partnership of the two communities in the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of the island  and in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Turkish and Greek communities and the other parties concerned. It is in that hope that Turkey has accepted the proposition of the Secretary-General for the reactivation of the talks in their new form. All we wish now is that these talks arrive at a successful conclusion. In speaking about Cyprus  I take the opportunity to reiterate the deep appreciation of myGovernment to all those who contribute to the peacekeeping effort in the island.62.	Up to now  I have touched upon some important problems occupying the international scene. I have tried to draw f-s impartial a picture possible. But if I have cited both negative and positive factors with almost equal weight  this is not merely out of a concern for objectivity. The present situation in our world is indeed an extremely complex one  made up of quite contradictory elements. Yet  essentially  we seem to be facing two diverging paths  one leading to disaster and the other to hope. The only similarity which can be found in these two alternatives is that they are both of a cosmic dimension.63.	Although the problems of our times have roots which go deep into our past  it is nevertheless an inescapable fact that the onus of coping with them belongs to our generation. All our thinkers  leaders  statesmen  all our public figures with influence and authority  even all the rank-and-file people whose preferences and rejections make up popular opinion-in a word  all of us-are responsible for making the ultimate choice between the path of despair and the path of happiness. That is our historic task which  while it is tremendously difficult  ought to be considered also as a source of pride by all people of goodwill and dedication to the betterment of the human lot.64.	How  then  to make this vital choice between bifurcating paths? How to strive for peace  prosperity and happiness  avoiding all pitfalls which may well be dangerous enough to prove fatal for the entire human race? To answer those questions  we must have a general look at the fundamental aspirations of man  as well as at the successes and failures he has encountered in his endeavors. We can thus hope to trace some of the causes which lie behind his checkered record  and to think of ways and means which  seemingly modest at the outset  can eventually grow successfully if adopted in goodwill and used with patience.65.	With the hindsight provided by a long history  and with the increased awareness caused by the exacerbation of the problems  mainly because of the discrepancy between the great technical advance  on the one hand  and the relative lack of success in the conduct of international affairs  on the other  the attainment of man's aspirations is not only more urgent but also more evident today than ever. Man aspires to peace. He seeks it more sincerely and more fervently than he ever sought the glory of the battlefields. He seeks real security  the kind of security which is both the prerequisite and the fruit of peace. He knows that neither freedom nor co-operation can flourish in a climate of strife. He is now at last aware that he is his brother's keeper and he must indeed love his neighbor.66.	Man aspires to prosperity. He realizes that his most basic needs will risk going unsatisfied unless his labor is put to full profit through general  even world-wide  co-operation. He hopes to find in this co-operation a means of achieving a fairer pattern of distribution of the wealth produced among nations. He understands the importance of a sound social order  just as he sees the role that economic development plays in shaping it.67.	And  lastly  man aspires to a more hospitable environment to live in. He begins to heed the solemn warning of nature. He grasps the grim fact that world resources are neither inexhaustible nor proof against deadly deterioration  in fact  there is no denying that this planet of ours can  through our carelessness  become an almost unsuitable place for human survival. On the other hand  if not subjected to wanton destruction  it can at the same time preserve its pristine beauties and adorn itself by man-made wonders. Technological advances  which ought to be a source of well-being and happiness  will be a threat to our very existence if not achieved with a sense of responsibility.68.	Those being mankind's most outstanding goals  how far has he advanced towards them up to now? To belittle the distance covered in the course of long centuries of civilization would be tantamount to disparaging the creative ability of the human mind. Man's achievements are indeed impressive. But are they  in their actual shape  capable of satisfying his ever-growing needs? We have already stated that man's past record in this connexion has been an uneven one  marked by failures as well as by successes. The problems confronting us today  such as overpopulation  food shortages  lack of adequate education and health facilities  our near helplessness in the face of natural calamities  and the absence of an atmosphere of trust and security  bear witness to these failures.69.	However  it seems to us that through our failures and successes we have accomplished one important task: we have aroused a common consciousness among all the peoples of the problems which beset us. We believe the time is ripe now to make use of this common consciousness  and the best instrument we have for this purpose is the United Nations.70.	One feature of international relations is the process of detente. We welcome this development as it increases our hopes for a durable peace. However  up to the present  detente has been far from reaching a completely satisfactory level  both in scope and in solidity.71.	In spite of the inauguration of an atmosphere of detente we are still experiencing strife  conflict and hostility. A genuine detente on a global scale is bound to be an unfulfilled wish of the peoples of the world as long as this state of affairs remains unchanged. Conditions obtaining in international relations being what they are  it will of course be  to say the least  unrealistic to hope for an immediate elimination of political conflicts. They are too deep-rooted to be conjured away immediately or easily.72.	But does this mean that we are utterly powerless to do anything whatsoever in this domain here and now? If  as I said  we are unable to do away speedily with the conflicts themselves  is it not within our power to check the crises they engender? Can we not find some means to take away their acuteness? Would it be too much to contemplate a kind of freeze for some types of political conflicts for limited periods of time? Recalling the United Nations noteworthy accomplishments through the declaration of the Decades in the fields of disarmament as well as of economic development  would it not be within the grasp of this Assembly to declare  for example  a '""decade of political conciliation"" and devise the means of promoting it? Could we not systematize and concert all individual and collective past efforts within this Organization to such a noble task? Could we not translate such a spirit of conciliation into a system of effective co-ordination of all the various political  economic and social efforts?73.	Such an approach to some types of international conflicts would not only enable us to benefit from the healing effects of time but would also enable our Organization through the systematization of its efforts to speed up their settlement.74.	In saying this  I am not making any formal proposal but rather submitting these views for meditation and consideration.75.	I must also emphasize that my remarks have no bearing on conflicts resulting from colonialism and the forceful occupation of foreign territories. We cannot expect either a subjected people or freedom-loving countries to tolerate colonial rule for any length of time. Neither can we tolerate violations of fundamental human rights in contravention of solemnly undertaken international agreements. The same applies to the case of lands wrenched away by brutal force.76.	Problems created by such causes demand not only our Organization's urgent and undivided attention  but also its uncompromising action.77.	To conclude  I should like to underline one outstanding feature that seems to characterize our times  namely  that man's inner revolution  his expectations  in short  man's consciousness has now reached a level of development that clearly outstrips what his political  social aid economic environment can provide for him. There is a new individual consciousness whether a man be rich or poor  strong or weak  developed or undeveloped the quality and magnitude of which have been unparalleled in any previous era of human history.78.	This unbalanced relationship between man and his total environment carries the seeds of both promise and calamity for our future. When countries all over the world are striving through indMdual efforts or  as in the case of regional and global organizations  through collective efforts to meet the challenge of our age  the problems of the political environment cannot be abandoned to haphazard and non-systematized solutions  in isolation from the social and economic environment of man. At a time of common destiny for all nations  problems facing man must be boldly taken up in their totality  for if they are not  we may suffer the loss of man's accomplishments. That is why I felt compelled to call upon this august Assembly to ponder deeply in respect of the political problems singled out  the choice we now face between hope and disaster  between promise and despair  between consolation and conflict. The implication is clear. There is no place for a mentality of status quo in the archaic sense. It is a change towards the satisfaction of human aspirations that is needed  but must this change be disorderly  destructive  disruptive and even deadly or  in our efforts for a better world to live in  can we not act intelligently and with a sense of responsibility and with imagination?79.	I believe it is through this attentive  wise and patient action of the United Nations that we can best hope to see great Atatiirk's life-long dream of ""peace at home and peace in the world""' come true for the benefit of all mankind.80.	I wish all success for the work of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly."
"115",7039,"TZA",27,1972,"Mr. President  my first and very pleasant duty is to congratulate you  on behalf of the Tanzanian delegation  on your unanimous election as President of-the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are convinced that your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman constitute a valuable pledge for the success of this very important session. Our delegation would also like to place on record its appreciation of the able way in which the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  Mr. Adam Malik  your distinguished predecessor  guided the deliberations of the last session.50.	We have read with interest the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/8701 and Add.l] and I would like to express  from the very outset  our appreciation for this report  which is a masterly presentation and appraisal of the developments in the international community during the past 12 months.51.	Looking back over the annals of our Organization  the events of last year stand out remarkably as milestones on the road to the realization of the aims and purposes of the United Nations. I refer in particular to the reinstatement of the People's Republic of China in its seat in the United Nations and to the rest of the chain of events which have dramatically influenced the pattern of power both within the Organization and outside it.52.	With the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the Organization  the principle of universality was once more recognized in practice  and above all a sense of realism started to guide the foreign policies of many countries which had been till then Sinophobic. It was indeed inconceivable that world peace and justice could be achieved and maintained while the most populous  and one of the most important  countries in the world was excluded from this instrument of world peace and justice. We therefore once more welcome this long-overdue event and  while doing so  we hope that a complete realization of that principle of universality will continue to be our goal in this Organization.53.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  we have witnessed a growing trend towards detente  particularly between the major Powers. We believe that the softening of hearts where there had been prolonged hostilities  and the adoption of a conciliatory spirit where there had been hard-and-fast differences  could pave the way to understanding and to peaceful solutions to the many problems that bedevil our planet. We welcome not only the detente between the big Powers  but also the rapprochement between the different parties in Korea  Germany and the Indian subcontinent.54.	In welcoming this process  my delegation would nevertheless echo the caution repeatedly expressed by the smaller nations  particularly those belonging to the non- aligned movement  that bilateral and other limited arrangements between the major Powers cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of this Organization. The improvement of relations among the big Powers is a necessary aspect of the efforts to bring about peace. Yet  any dealings among the major Powers that bypass the United Nations cannot accommodate the interests of all the Members of this Organization and cannot therefore guarantee a lasting peace. Durable peace and security must be worked out with the participation of all countries  big and small.55. The principle of collective responsibility and collective decision on the issues of peace and security in our world must equally be observed even if for one reason or another efforts towards international peace and security have to be undertaken outside the ambit of our Organization. Any attempt to evade this democratic procedure will inevitably be somewhat suspect. Indeed  while these bilateral agreements and understandings may serve the interests of the Powers concerned  they do not necessarily take into account the interests of the rest of the world community  notwithstanding representations to the contrary.56.	Yet  even if we assume that all the negotiations  some of them secret  that have taken place between the major Powers of the world have been conducted in the interest of our collective humanity  we must at the same time recognize that the process of active detente that we have witnessed over the period since the last session of the Assembly has not significantly lessened the threat to world peace and security. Thus  for example  while Europe has been witnessing a detente  tensions have been building up elsewhere in the world. Nor  for that matter  has the slight thaw in the frozen waters of the cold war of the 1960s and early 1970s appreciably reduced the misery and injustice under which millions of people in the world have so long suffered.57.	The war in Indochina continues to inflict disaster  misery and suffering on the people of that unhappy area. On 8 May  the President of the United States ordered the blockade of North Viet-Nam  and since then that small country has been subjected to some of the most destructive and barbaric bombings that have been experienced by any country since the time of Hiroshima.58.	The methods employed by the United States in its futile and senseless attempts to subjugate the Vietnamese people have no parallel in the history of warfare. Indeed  even some American news media sadly report that the people of North Vietnam are being bombed back to the stone age. This is both inhuman and outrageous. The present killings conducted by American naval and air forces in Vietnam are being undertaken  so it is said  to save the face and honor of the United States. But nothing would be more honorable than for the United States to order an immediate end to all the annihilation being carried out by the American forces in Viet-Nam.59.	An immediate end must also be put to the United States intervention in the affairs of Cambodia so that that traditionally non-aligned country can be allowed to pursue its progressive policies of peace and neutrality in complete freedom and security. Tanzania  in consonance with the position of many other non-aligned and peace-loving nations  wishes to reiterate its indignation at the continued aggression perpetrated by imperialism against the people of Indochina  and its full support of these heroic people who have demonstrated their strength  tenacity and perseverance in the struggle against gross injustice and bullying by the forces of reaction and international imperialism.60.	The highly explosive situation in the Middle East continues to preoccupy the attention of the international community. Few will challenge the fact that the status quo  apart from being a fragile and uneasy ""no peace  no war"" situation  also constitutes a gross betrayal of the Charter of the United Nations. Israel seems to be determined to flout with impunity decisions and resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly. Since the General Assembly last addressed itself to the question there have been no positive changes in the situation. If anything  we have witnessed a further consolidation of Israeli conquests with concomitant repercussions affecting the possible peaceful solution of the conflict.61.	The question that arises now is no longer whether the international community can condone such arrogance and intransigence on the part of the occupying forces  but rather whether we can afford to be satisfied with mere moral condemnations. I wish to reiterate here the call my Government has made in the past both in this Organization and in other international forums. Israel must withdraw unconditionally from all the Arab territories that it now illegally occupies resulting from its 1967 war of aggression. It must also fully respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Only when it fulfills these conditions will there be hope for a durable peace in the Middle East.62.	My delegation has been very encouraged by the hopeful developments that have taken place in the Korean peninsula. While welcoming these encouraging developments  it is our conviction that  left to themselves  the Korean people are capable of solving their own problems in a brotherly and peaceful atmosphere.63.	It is the view of the Tanzanian delegation that it is now more necessary than ever before for this Organization to respond favorably to these developments by putting an end to all foreign intervention in Korea. Such a move will not only help to remove suspicions between the parties concerned but will also be a reassurance to them that the United Nations favors the methods of approach they have taken. We strongly call upon this Organization to withdraw its so-called military command from the area and to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. In particular  we call upon the United States to stop abusing the United Nations flag and to withdraw all its troops forthwith. The so-called military command serves neither any purpose useful to our Organization nor  for that matter  the interests of the Korean people. It is our sincere belief that the initiatives already taken by the Koreans themselves should receive the encouragement of our Organization. We therefore deeply regret that the General Assembly will not be addressing itself to the question in the current session.64.	Let me now turn to the events which tragically continue to cause much suffering and misery in our continent.65.	With the exception of South Africa and Portugal  there is not a single country represented in this hall which has not  at one time or another  condemned colonialism. Yet colonialism continues to ravage vast areas of the world. This is the greatest tragedy of our time. It is  at the same time  the most obnoxious and pernicious scandal perpetrated by some Members of this Organization  particularly those Member countries which have the power to end this evil system.66.	But although the pace of decolonization is still painfully slow  we are conscious and appreciative of the role that the United Nations  through its Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  has played during the year. For the first time  a United Nations mission has had the opportunity to visit and to see the liberated areas of a colonial Territory in Africa. The visit is the more important because it was undertaken at the invitation of and conducted under the protection of the liberation movement of the Territory  the PAIGC 6 which has liberated those areas. The fact that this visit was successfully completed despite the sustained and intensified barbaric bombardments of those areas by the Portuguese Fascist forces can lead to only one conclusion for the United Nations  that is  the PAIGC exercises affective control over vast areas of Guinea (Bissau). The least  therefore  that the United Nations can do during the current session as a tribute to both the freedom  fighters in Guinea (Bissau) and the gallant young men who went on that mission  must be the reaffirmation of that fact. For our part and at this particular moment we pay our tribute to the worthy representatives of Ecuador  Mr. Sevilla-Boija; of Sweden  Mr. Lofgren; and of Tunisai  Mr. Belkhiria  and to the two members of the Secretariat. Mr. Nagata and Mr. Gaye  for a job well done. In this connexion  my delegation is happy to recall the fact -that our brother  Amflcar Cabral  Secretary General of PAIGC  rightly called these eminent sons of Europe  Latin America  Asia and Africa  cosmonauts of decolonization.67.	It remains the duty of the United Nations now to implement the recommendations contained in the report of that Mission [Al8723lRev.l  chap. X  Annex I]; for the supreme significance of that Special Mission does not lie only in what it has seen  written  or said; it also lies in what the United Nations consequently does to help the victims of Portuguese Fascist oppression in Guinea (Bissau) an<^ Cape Verde.68.	Guinea (Bissau) is but a part of the over-all colonial and racial situation prevailing in Africa today. It is part of that situation which not only oppresses the peoples in those colonial Territories but also affects very directly the domestic and foreign policies of our independent African States. To us  the colonial situation prevailing in Africa is the major determinant of our policies and is central in our daily lives. Consequently  we view it as the most burning issue before the United Nations.69.	Yet' it is the only issue which  given the will and honesty on the part of the leaders of this Organization assembled here  is capable of an immediate solution. Colonialism is not a natural or God-made disaster; it is man-made  man-maintained and  although strongly condemned publicly  in private it is condoned by some Members of this Organization. It is to these Members  particularly the United States of America  the United Kingdom  France and several other Members within the NATO alliance  that we feel we must once again address our appeal to re-examine their policies in relation to the colonial situation in Africa. If the Governments of these countries agree  and indeed in public they do  that colonialism is an evil system because it is an attack upon our common humanity  then they must join with us in the fight against those forces and regimes which have chosen the maintenance and enforcement of colonialism as a way of life. Let them cease the supply of weapons to South Africa and Portugal weapons which systematically have been used against the African people in Angola  in Mozambique  in Guinea (Bissau)  in Namibia and in Southern Rhodesia who have been and are fighting to make real the objectives of the United Nations  that is  the elimination of colonialism and racism.70.	In essence  the liberation struggle being waged in the colonial territories of Africa is only an extension of the struggle being waged by the United Nations. These people need and deserve the support  moral and material  of every honest and serious Member of this Organization.71.	Since the last session of the General Assembly important developments have taken place in the colonial Territories of southern Africa. The African people in Southern Rhodesia  despite intimidation  arrests and banishments  have categorically rejected  the so-called proposals for a settlement agreed upon last year between the United Kingdom Government and the illegal minority regime of Ian Smith. To Africa this rejection was obvious from the very beginning. We saw no useful purpose whatsoever in the exercise of testing African opinion in that Territory on that issue  and we told the British Government so. Now that the Pearce Commission report  is out and the African voice has been heard  what does the United Kingdom Government propose to do next? And what does the United Nations propose to do during this session?72.	Let us tell the United Kingdom Government in no uncertain terms that there is no need  none whatsoever  for so-called reflection by the Rhodesians. There is not the slightest possibility that the Africans in Southern Rhodesia will change their mind and the Pearce Commission makes this point quite clear. The report is also clear on the reasons given by Africans for opposing the proposals. Their opposition stems from the deep frustration and humiliation at the kind of life imposed on them by the white regime. And let us be frank  each and every one of us would react likewise if we were equally frustrated and humiliated.73\^The United Kingdom Government thus has a clear course of action. It must act to assert its authority and change the present power structure in Rhodesia. The United Kingdom Government must act to ensure that there will be no independence in Southern Rhodesia before majority rule. To Africans in that Territory and to Africa as a whole no compromise will be acceptable.74.	The course of action for the United Nations is also very clear. The Organization must give every possible assistance to the liberation movements fighting in Southern Rhodesia. It is through this assistance that Southern Rhodesia will be saved from racial bloodshed.75.	It is most regrettable that one big Power  a permanent member of the Security Council  the United States of America  has chosen to strengthen the illegal racist minority regime of Ian Smith by importing chrome from SouthernRhodesia in absolute contravention of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against that Territory. What exactly is the explanation for that action? There is no doubt that that grave violation of the Security Council resolution by the United States of America serves to reinforce and strengthen the forces of racism and colonialism not only in Southern Rhodesia but in southern Africa as a whole.76.	Equally regrettable actions by certain Western imperialist Powers are seen in the Territories under Portuguese domination. In those Territories  where the liberation struggle has been advancing very satisfactorily  certain of those Powers led by the United States of America  the United Kingdom  France and others have been supplying the Government of Portugal with such deadly weapons as napalm  toxic gases  herbicide .defoliants and other chemical substances. Vast areas of these Territories have been destroyed  as have crops grown by African people  in the futile hope of starving the people into submission to slavery. There is perhaps no need to say more on the Territories under Portuguese domination since much has been said and written by the United Nations Special Mission that has visited some of those areas. It must  however  be stressed here that Africa considers those Powers which are aiding the white racist and colonialist regimes in southern Africa to be hostile to it.77.	There is one other important matter on which I wish to comment briefly. The Security Council has by its resolution 309 (1972)  entrusted the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the task of finding new initiatives with all parties concerned in the Namibian question with a view to finding a solution to that question. There is no continent more anxious for a solution to the question of Namibia than Africa. We consider ourselves to be interested parties  not only because we are Africans and Namibia is an African territory  but also because  as Members of the United Nations  we fully accept that Namibia is the responsibility of the United Nations and is  therefore  our responsibility. Whatever solution is sought to the problem of Namibia must therefore be within the context of the decisions of the United Nations. Specifically  the solution must mean the termination of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African authorities. Furthermore  the phrase ""self-determination and independence"" must be in the context of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). We therefore hope that whatever initiatives the Secretary- General undertakes will not deviate from this position.78.	Last year  at the twenty-sixth session  my delegation expressed the hope that with the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade in 1970 the developed nations would exhibit a new spirit of co-operation so as to find appropriate solutions to the problems of trade and development of the developing countries f 1951st meeting  para. 116]. At that time we placed high hopes in the third session of UNCTAD. That session is now over  and the story and catalog of the disappointments of the developing world not to mention the unfulfilled promises and unimplemented agreements have been eloquently ex-pressed by many eminent representatives of the developing countries in this and other forums and I need not  therefore  repeat them.79.	The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen  while the terms of trade continue to grow in favor of the developed countries at the expense of the poor nations. The flow of development finance has fallen far short of the target set in the first United Nations Development Decade. The burden of debt-servicing has not only become intolerable but has at times even retarded development by siphoning off national resources.80.	There is no doubt that the monetary system of the last two decades can no longer be effective. We believe that reform is necessary and required by both the developing and the developed countries. As developing nations we are entitled  as a matter of right  to insist that both now and in the future any reorganization of the world monetary system must be with our active participation and consent  because we believe that no reform could be satisfactory unless both the developed and the developing countries participated in the decision making. All countries of the world should in unison evolve a world system which seeks to serve all mankind  a system whereby there will be no senior and no junior partners  for we can no longer let decisions be handed down to us or let a few countries think and agree in the interest of the majority of mankind as though that were the monopoly of those few.81.	The historic United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held last June in Stockholm  made far- reaching decisions which  if implemented  could shape future environmental law which would save our earth from destruction. The Declaration of the Conference  was given the necessary balance by incorporating in it provisions on human rights  economic development and trade. For  as we stated in Stockholm  we cannot credibly talk of the environment without accepting basic conditions and rights by which man ought to live. For  after all  what is the purpose of the environment but man himself?82.	Furthermore  the action plan for the human environment   which envisages the setting up of an international body to co-ordinate activities in the field of the environment  has the support of my Government. We strongly believe that international cooperation is necessary if nations are to solve most environmental problems. In all this we wish to emphasize that immediate priority must be given to the needs of developing countries  whose major environmental concern is development  for development and the safeguarding of the environment are complementary.83.	This year  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament observed its tenth anniversary. Naturally  it is tempting for us to pause with the Conference to look back at the progress of our efforts towards general and complete disarmament. First we note that there is a list of so-called disarmament treaties: the Antarctic Treaty  the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and Under Water  the Treaty of Tatelolco  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the treaties banning nuclear weapons in outer space and on the sea-bed and the recent convention outlawing biological weapons. And in May of this year the strategic arms limitation agreements were concluded in Moscow. On the face of it  nuclear weapons have been prohibited in all environments except underground. As far as the list goes  it all looks quite impressive. We call it a list of achievements. Let me state right away that we have no intention to belittle those efforts. We do admit that at least they indicate the acceptance in principle of the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. Indeed  my country is a signatory to some of the agreements. However  I am impelled on this occasion to reiterate the position of my Government on this matter.84.	First  it is clear  at least to my delegation  that all those treaties are half-hearted ancDonly peripheral. Instead of going to the root of the problem  they only nibble at its edge. They do not  for example  seek to destroy the existing stockpiles which alone are more than enough to wipe away the entire living world.85.	Secondly  the importance of those treaties is often exaggerated. Those treaties tend to hide the reality of the existing perilous state of affairs. They are deceptive  and they lull us into complacency which; given the facts  we cannot afford. In the introduction to his report  the Secretary-General has this to say concerning the field of disarmament:""The balance sheet of the first decade shows that the declared goal of general and complete disarmament has not yet been achieved. Neither has the arms race been halted nor perceptibly slowed down. In fact  the armaments race has spiraled to a level higher than ever before. For example  during the decade of the 1960s  the nations of the world poured a total of $1 870 000 million into- weapons of warfare; in recent years  total world expenditure for these purposes has risen to about $200 000 million annually."" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 3.JNor has nuclear testing ceased. Nuclear tests continue to be blasted underground and in the atmosphere  causing untold hazards to human life and peril to the entire race of mankind.86.	In restating the above position of my delegation  it has not been my intention to put the blame on the honorable work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. That Conference does not manufacture arms  nor has it as a Conference any interest in their production. Rather  it is the Powers concerned which are entirely responsible for this state of affairs. Had they the will to achieve any progress  the Conference would have no place to occupy  except perhaps as a co-ordinating device. Without that will on the part of those Powers  however  the Conference will continue to waste time and energy. Indeed  the fact is that all the major decisions in this field are made behind the back of the Conference.87.	In this connexion  my delegation would like once more to repeat that it is only by the full participation of the entire world community that meaningful discussions in matters affecting the whole of mankind can be undertaken. To that end we hope that a world disarmament conference  after proper preparations  will be held as soon as possible.88.	Last year my delegation sponsored an item [item 98] aimed at the adoption of a declaration to demilitarize the Indian Ocean. After a very serious debate on the item  the General Assembly adopted a resolution which embodied a Declaration designating the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and called upon the great Powers  as well as the littoral States  to take the necessary steps to put into effect the provisions of the Declaration [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. That Declaration was in line with the Declaration adopted by a large group of non-aligned countries  among which were littoral States  assembled in Lusaka in 1970   and reaffirmed at the meeting of foreign ministers of non-aligned States in New York in September of last year  and further reaffirmed at the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Georgetown  Guyana  in August of this year.89.	My delegation would like to reaffirm the position of a large number of developing countries that it is in the interest of peace in the various regions of the world that great-Power rivalry should be eliminated from those regions. To that end we demand that all foreign military bases be removed  not only from the territory of other nations  but also from the various regions of the world  including Asia  Africa and Latin America. We hope that the United Nations will continue to pursue this goal  and especially that it will take further action this year to promote the necessary efforts to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.90.	Turning now to the question of the oceans  my country has followed with keen interest  and has participated actively in  the negotiations in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction since its establishment. We are pleased to note that the international community has on the whole accepted the fact that the present rules applicable to the marine environment are inadequate  inequitable and out of date. The Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)] is an historic landmark in this area  and my delegation wishes to reiterate its support for it.91.	The sea-bed Committee  which was enlarged in 1970 and given the mandate to prepare for a third conference on the law of the sea  has done commendable work  although it has been rather slow in some areas. The main issues have been identified  and the political negotiations have reached an advanced stage. Although there is a lot of work to be done  we believe that the international community is in a position to undertake negotiations at a higher level. The time is now ripe for the convocation of a law of the sea conference  and we support in principle the convocation of such a conference in 1973. What remains to be done in the sea-bed Committee can be done in one or two sessions before the conference is held.92.	In this connexion  we believe it is now time that a conference of this nature were convened in a developing country to enable the full participation and involvement of the developing world in the formulation of just rules of international law for ocean space. We therefore whole-heartedly welcome the invitation extended by the Government of Chile to hold one of the sessions of the conference in Santiago. The excellent services and congenial environment provided to the third session of UNCTAD highly commend Santiago.93.	We also welcome the invitation extended by the Government of Austria to hold some sessions of that conference in Vienna  a city whose traditional standing as a host of great international conferences is well known to all of us.94.	As we meet here for our twenty-seventh regular session  we are conscious of the fact that the eyes of the people of the world are focused on us. Our Organization has given great hopes to billions of people  but at the same time we must recognize that as a result of the acts of omission and commission on the part of some of its Members and the inability of the United Nations to take meaningful action due to obvious limitations  those hopes have at times been transformed into frustrations. It is incumbent upon all of us  not only for the sake of this great Organization  but above all in the interests of peace and security  to resolve to overcome these frustrations. We have both the means and the capacity to do so  provided that all of us rededicate ourselves to a determination to abide by the principles of the Charter and the decisions that we collectively take. Given that will  I am confident that the problems I have enunciated in my address  as well as many others  are not beyond solution.95.	Humanity as a whole still looks to our Organization not only for its survival but indeed for its progress. Mankind is anxiously waiting to see us eliminate the many areas of conflict on our planet. The people of Africa are waiting with very high hopes for the freedom that they have been denied for so long. The hungry of the world are raising their hands to our Organization  hoping that international co-operation will one day afford every human soul at least two meals a day. In short  the world is anxiously waiting to see whether this session will be yet another platform for declarations of intentions or for a definite pledge of action.96.	It is by such a definite pledge to act that our session will ultimately be judged. And it is to all real and meaningful actions that my delegation would like to pledge its untiring support."
"116",7085,"UGA",27,1972,"Mr. President  I have already  oil this rostrum  had the pleasant occasion to welcome your election aiid the appointment of our illustrious Secretary-General. Let me now take the opportunity to bring you arid this Assembly the good wishes for the success of our deliberations of my President  General Idi Amin Dada  the Government of Uganda and all our people.198.	As a direct result of a horrendous global conflict this Organization was founded with the firm resolve that never again should mankind engage in an even more suicidal war.199.	It is true that a hard look at the international scene still reveals unresolved areas of conflict  but it is equally true that this Organization  by providing a meeting point for potential antagonists over a quarter of a century  paved the way for the current detente among those with the capacity to decimate this planet. When we reaffirm our support and belief in this Organization  therefore  it is not a platitude but our deeply rooted conviction that this Organization has ho eqUal for the preservation of the peace of mankind.200.	My delegation welcomes the current  and apparently genuine efforts among the big Powers to replace confrontation with dialog: between Washington and Moscow; between Peking and Washington; and  coming up  between Moscow and Peking over their frontier disputes. The solutions to the German and Berlin questions should contribute towards a Stable peace in Europe and in the world.201.	We cannot  however  oversimplify the price for peace. Despite the strategic arms limitation agreements between the superpowers  defense experts continue to show us that the arms race is still on  and that billions of dollars ate still being spent on armaments which  we are told  Would never be used. Nuclear tests still continue to negate the spirit and philosophy under which the nuclear test-ban Treaty was signed. While we have made a promising beginning in the search of peace  It is the view of my delegation that we should not rest this search permanently of false premise on the premise of a balance of terror  as Wi'iSton Churchill called it.2 )2. The existence of great armaments must surely under- He the eventuality of using them. As long as they exist  despite all the well-meant steps taken to establish peace  they could be used to devastate our world. The better premise for world peace  therefore  must remain the total destruction of all nuclear weapons and a permanent ban on them together with a ban on other highly destructive weapons. So long as big Powers continue their military industrial complexes their products must find use and markets that are provided by war.203.	My delegation joins the peace-lovers all over the world in demanding peace in Viet-Nam. The staggering waste in this war  in terms of human and material resources  has no justification in a world community that  more than ever  so widely shares a common need for peace and justice. The United States should set the example to us all and show us that a super-Power can exercise self-restraint and respect the independence of others  even if they are small and poor States.204.	It is our hope  too  that the current winds of peace that are blowing across this planet will sweep through the Middle East to provide a just and lasting solution. As we stated here last year [1943rd meeting]  it is the view of my Government that any fair and lasting solution to the Middle East problem must be based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The occupied Arab territories should be vacated in toto by Israel and  in turn  the Arab nations must comply with the conditions of that resolution. It remains a sad commentary on our times that force is still an instrument for acquiring territory or settling international disputes. It seems so clear to us  too  that no lasting solution to this problem on a fair and just basis can be attained without a fair answer to the Palestinian refugee problem. Justice demands that Israel comply with the wishes of the Arab nations.205.	We in East Africa are directly and adversely affected by the closure of the Suez Canal. Most of our trade goes north to Europe  traditionally through that Canal. Its closure has meant long voyages around South Africa. The undesirable but inevitable consequence has been to enrich the obnoxious minority regimes in southern Africa  as they provide the ports of call. Freight costs have obviously increased. We therefore have a right to demand of Israel that it submit to a fair settlement which would involve the opening of the Canal.206.	It has now become a tradition that whenever we meet we must talk about decolonization  we must condemn minority racist regimes  we must censure the collaborators with them. But there is something disturbing about all this. Our eloquence in speech  our resolutions on paper in the organs of this Organization  have been as conspicuous as our actions in their actual implementation have been few and feeble.207.	The number of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on decolonization given in the documentation constituting the basis for the meetings of the Security Council held in Addis Ababa early this year  was impressive. These two organs have since then adopted several other resolutions on various steps to be taken for establishing self-determination and ending minority rule. Little  if any  action  regrettable to say  has followed. 208.	In Rhodesia  5.5 million Africans continue to be dispossessed of their fundamental liberties by a minority of a quarter of a million whites. Crimes depriving the majority of their rights continue to be committed by the Smith regime. Millions of Africans have been arbitrarily and forcibly evicted from their lands which they have owned from time immemorial  in order for that land to be reserved to a few whites. Their dwellings and fields have been set on fire by the thousands to effect this eviction. Their leaders have been indefinitely locked up without trial. There is no security to speak of for them. In total disregard of United Nations resolutions on the matter  the United Kingdom  which claims the sovereign right over Rhodesia a claim that this Organization recognizes has refused to assert its authority and ensure human rights and self- determination in Rhodesia. It has totally disregarded the hardships of and overwhelming humanitarian considerations respecting the 5.5 million indigenous Rhodesians; instead  to our amazement  it has attempted to rush this Assembly  supposedly on humanitarian grounds  into action for the benefit of only 65 000 of its nationals who are being legitimately asked to quit my country. What a double standard in international affairs!209.	There is a saying in English law that if you seek justice in equity you must come with clean hands. The United Kingdom has appealed to this Assembly not formally now  but continuously in private-saying that it is seeking justice for the 65 000 or so people who have been requested to depart from my country. But we should ask  does the United Kingdom come to this Assembly with clean hands? Does it come when it has invariably recognized humanitarian considerations wherever they have affected other peoples  not just the 65 000 who are nationals of the United Kingdom? Does it come after having fulfilled the obligations I have just referred to in relation to the 5.5 million indigenous Rhodesians who are totally dispossessed and in quite a helpless situation? Does it come after having rectified all these things  to ask for justice before this Assembly?210.	You will answer that; and I am quite convinced that  with the facts set before you  you will answer that the United Kingdom  rather than coming with clean hands  comes with arms shoulder-deep in complicity with the racist regimes and Rhodesia in its course of independence without justification  in complicity with the racists who are depriving our brothers in southern Africa of their rights. I have no doubt that this Assembly will render a judgment that is worthy of it as a world forum for justice.211.	It seems clear that the United Kingdom Government is in fact making it possible for the Smith regime to establish legitimacy under the umbrella of British protection. The latest British vetoes in the Security Council indicate this. My Government still holds the view  as most Members here do  that Britain should quell the Smith rebellion by force  hold a constitutional conference for all Rhodesians to determine their constitution  and grant independence to a government that is based on majority rule.212.	The responsibility resting on Portugal for Mozambique  Angola and Guinea (Bissau) is no less clear. That such a small  distant and relatively poor European State should hold out for so long in its African colonial wars is sad testimony to the manner in which the declared words of some Members here are contrary to their deeds. If some Member States did not directly aid Portugal's war effort  the colonial wars would by now be over. We therefore appeal to them  in particular to the United States of America  to desist from giving material help that will prolong these colonial wars. Whatever happens  it remains an ineluctable fact of human history that the freedom-fighters will ultimately triumph. Our talk here  really  is about what price they should pay for their freedom.213.	My delegation urges this session to examine more closely  not how many resolutions on decolonization should be adopted  but what action should be taken to implement those already adopted. There are many in the world who are feeling some disillusionment because we have so far failed to match our speeches with deeds. We are facing a credibility gap of increasing magnitude. We owe it to ourselves to do better.214.	Closely associated with decolonization in Africa is the problem of apartheid in South Africa. The resolutions passed and the documents compiled in this Organization on the unspeakable crime of apartheid are matched only by those on decolonization  yet there has been so little done in practice to implement them. The failure is due not only to the apartheid regime  itself but also and this is more important to powerful external support for that regime.215.	No amount of words by those who hold great investments in South Africa will convince us that they are serious about restoring justice and equity in that society. Indeed  it is true that through their economic interests they  more than any  hold the key to perpetuating the dismantling apartheid. The world will not tire of demanding constructive action from them.216.	We welcome the recent appointment by our Secretary-General of an experienced diplomat to set the ball rolling towards Namibia's independence and self-determination. But we hold no illusions: the road is long and hard and any emmisary walks along it with great difficulty. Yet it is a beginning. We will not wait for a decade to give Namibia freedom. All the organs competent under the Charter have pronounced the illegality of South Africa's hold on Namibia. It is up to the Member State to give practical meaning to those pronouncements.217.	My Government will continue to give material and other aid to all freedom-fighters in the Territories I have mentioned. It is the least we can contribute to their struggle for freedom.218.	Let me turn to the world economic situation. As a developing nation  still largely dependent on a few agricultural commodities for the world market  it is crucial for us to have a stable world economic situation. In this connexion the enlargement and consolidation of the European Economic Community will be significant for Africa in general and my country in particular. While we do already have some preferential treatment  the range of items is far too limited and the conditions have much room for improvement.219.	The European Economic Community  because of its historical past  has a duty to Africa. It is our sincere hope that this newly found economic cohesion in Europe will be used not to perpetuate under-development among our nations but rather to inject more developmental aid to accelerate our economic growth.220.	There should be no monopolized areas of trade in a rapidly shrinking world. The socialist countries and the United States could help a good deal more than they have hitherto done in the field of economic aid to developing nations.221.	It was with some regret that my Government noted the results of the third session of UNCTAD  but the fundamental difficulty was not with that session but with the member nations  which alone hold the key to releasing more generous terms to developing nations  both for commodity prices and for foreign aid.222.	It is too late in the day to have a planetary concept whereby the rich get richer and the poor poorer. We are so interdependent that even those who call themselves super-Powers could not exist without the host of intermediate and small nations of the world.223.	In this regard it is vital to curtail armaments  in order to release those billions for the betterment of all mankind. Then  truly  the big donors and the big nations of the world would be worthy of greatness and respect. There can be no genuine pride and respect if greatness if greatness it can be called is based principally on one's capability to destroy our planet  including oneself.224.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June  was a landmark. It is the duty of us all to avoid so upsetting the delicate balance of life and nature on earth that we could soon become a dying planet. My Government is committed to undertaking whatever is essential  in the light of present and future knowledge  to maintain and protect our environment. In this connexion developing nations  not yet saturated with the polluting factors of the industrial States  could make good use of the latest anti-polluting knowledge and techniques and so avoid committing the errors of the industrial States. But the foreign companies exporting technology from the old to the new areas of industry must be rigidly controlled and required to establish new industries in accordance with the best and latest environmental techniques. Old polluting methods should be banned in developing nations and a concerted effort should be made to establish uniformity in this.225.	It is the view of my Government that the deterioration of the environment in industrial nations  where it is more acutely felt  is accentuated by established economic methods of production  which through self-interest do their best  sometimes  to resist new inventions that might help restore health to such environment. This is an urgent and fundamental  problem which the governments concerned must face with honesty and courage.226.	The issue of outer space is becoming increasingly important. My delegation welcomes the efforts of those Member States which engage in the utilization of outer space for the betterment of our world. We have supported the relevant treaties on the subject and will in principle support those that are to come. While we rightly engage actively in discussing problems indigenous to our earth  let us not be unmindful that throughout history outer space has had a profound influence on the human race. Who among us has not been struck  on a clear night  by the stupendous majesty of the heavens? Which culture on this planet does not  directly or indirectly  have legends of gods from outer space  influencing the great religions or mythologies of us all?227.	Today  man moves into outer space  not in imagination and thought as before  but in physical reality. These adventures may yet hold the most profound consequences for our planet. It is now generally accepted by most scientists that earth man may not be the only intelligent being in the universe. For that reason my delegation holds the view that those among us who explore outer space have a duty to keep us all fully informed of their findings.228.	Should we  for instance  seriously believe that the American moon program is principally designed to collect moon dust and rocks; or that the Soviet probes to Venus and elsewhere are primarily interested in ascertaining the high temperatures and related climatic matters? We say we are behind you in your explorations  but let us share all your important findings because sooner or later  if they bear relevance and significance to our planet  we are surely bound to do so.229.	Though a land-locked country  Uganda shares the active interest in the exploitation of the resources of the oceans for the betterment of mankind. We have followed the proceedings of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction with close interest  as it is now universally held that those natural resources beyond the limits of sovereign jurisdiction constitute the common heritage of mankind. My Government will support an effective international policy for the exploitation of these resources for the benefit of all.230.	Let me now turn to an issue that has become of direct concern to my country.23.1. In his statement on 27 September [2042nd meeting/ the British Foreign Secretary urged this Assembly to support a British move in demanding of my President that he revise his policy of expelling nearly 60 000 foreign nationals  about 55 000 of whom are British citizens. Although I made my reply to him from this rostrum then [2043rd meeting]  because I realize that many members of the General Assembly may have been absent I should like briefly to recount the history of this problem  without which it remains distorted and unfairly exploited by anti-Uganda propaganda.232. Towards the end of the last century  when the United Kingdom still ruled a colonial empire engulfing the Indian subcontinent and some East African countries  including my own  it systematically organized and promoted an exodus of its subjects from the Indian subcontinent to many of its colonies  including mine. These people were originally brought to East Africa principally to provide the labor for constructing the railway from Mombasa  on the Indian Ocean cost  to my capital city  850 miles inland. After this  the British organized them and engaged them to settle and to provide an instrument for promoting colonial trade and commerce. By 1900  although there were 2 000 British Asians in the country  they had already established their mastery over our trade and commerce.233.	The British  who administered Uganda until 1962  systematically ensured that their nationals of Asian extraction continued to dominate our economic life  without any reasonable effort to promote the interests of the indigenous people in this field. The pressure among the Africans became so great that in 1946 and 1947 there were serious riots in my country in protest against this British policy of systematically keeping the Africans out of the economic life of the country. The British colonial officers  instead of looking at the root of the problem  reacted by imprisoning the leaders of riots and suppressing their activities.234.	Since this did not provide the right answer  there was an extensive boycott of all Asian businesses in my country in 1959 which was so effective that it almost paralyzed the economic life of the country. Again  because we were still under British rule  the authorities  instead of recognizing and promoting the legitimate aspirations and interests of the overwhelming majority of the people of Uganda  chose to solve the problem by once more locking up the leaders of the trade boycott and suppressing it.235.	In 1962 Uganda became an independent sovereign State and was admitted as a Member by this Organization. But the economy was still almost totally dependent on these foreign nationals. If these British nationals had chosen to identify themselves with our country  to which they came poor and in which they made great fortunes  this problem would never have arisen at all. Indeed  I was myself witness to a number of occasions when the illustrious Prime Minister of India  the late Pandit Nehru  urged these British nationals to identify themselves with the countries of their habitual residence. His daughter  the present Prime Minister of India  before she was Prime Minister paid a visit to East Africa and repeated this call. In doing so  these foresighted leaders were in fact echoing what the leaders of my country and other neighboring countries had since independence been urging these British Asians to do  without success.236.	On independence  a Ugandan citizenship was created. All the indigenous Africans in Uganda automatically became Ugandan citizens. So did any Asian who was born in Uganda and one of whose parents had been born in Uganda. This covered some of these Asians  but not all. In addition  however  anyone among these British Asians could become a citizen by registration  if only he asked the Uganda Government between October 1962 and October 1964 to be registered as a citizen of our Republic. This offer of citizenship would have covered everyone among the people under consideration. Those who registered  or those among them who were qualified by birth  to be citizens have no problem  and they are citizens of my country  with as many rights and duties within the State as any of us has.237.	It is rare  you will agree with me  that a country offers its citizenship so generously and with so few demands to such a large group of aliens. But it remains a fact that the majority of these people who today are the subject of considerable discussion in fact deliberately  of their own volition  rejected the offer of the Uganda Government to grant them citizenship. Considering that they had made their fortunes in Uganda and that most of them had lived there for so many years  this rejection was not only painful to us  but an insult to our hospitality and to our worth as a nation. We were  in other words  expected to continue to play the role of a host for parasites  without any feeling of obligation on the part of our exploiters. Much damage has been done to our economy as a result of the conduct of these people  who control about 90 per cent of our economic and commercial life but who owe allegiance to foreign Powers. Despite our attempts to block all avenues for transporting money from Uganda  somehow they have always been one step ahead in beating the officials. The result  both unfavorable and regrettable  has been the outflow of money that should otherwise have been used and is so badly needed for our own development. All these factors have combined to give no alternative to my Government but to take the step  long overdue  of asking these aliens to depart for their countries of nationality.238.	I am aware that  quite cleverly  the United Kingdom is not impeaching our right to ask these people to go  but rather is attacking the method by which we have asked them to go. First  they cannot impeach us for asking aliens to go  because it is our right under the Charter to do so. Therefore  our impeachment before you  our censure  must be carried out  in the United Kingdom's view  by reliance on what is called ""humanitarian considerations"". But you cannot discuss this and get the sense of the. problem in its totality without taking into account the story I have just told.239.	I am aware that the United Kingdom speaks of some thousands who have become stateless among these people. Regrettable as this may be  it was no fault of the Uganda Government. The laws of Uganda on citizenship clearly require that anyone who registers for Ungandan citizenship must renounce his previous citizenship within three months of his registration. These people who are now called stateless were mostly British subjects. When they registered for Ugandan citizenship  they did not comply with this provision requiring them to renounce their previous citizenship within three months. The result was that they purported to become citizens of two countries  which  members here would agree with me  it would be most unusual for any State to permit  most particularly a young State which needs and deserves all the loyalty it can have from its nationals. When the moment came and they were required to present their papers to my Government  it was discovered that these people had not renounced their previous citizenship within a period of three months as stipulated by the Ugandan citizenship act. They therefore had never become citizens of Uganda. We hold that they must revert to their nationality of origin  which was British  or that of other countries which they used to hold. But  to our surprise  we were informed in the General Committee that these are stateless persons. Whether  however  they are stateless  or whether they belong to any State  my Government does recognize one fundamental postulate: that they are  like all of us  human beings.240.	Arising from the agitation of the United Kingdom Government at this session on this matter  lodging complaints  some of which were founded on ""facts"" gathered from newspapers  my President has communicated by his letter of 3 October 1972 to the Secretary-General the position of the Uganda Government on the most sensitive allegations made against us before this Assembly and at the bar of world opinion.241.	My President has given the following specific assurances  which were never really in doubt on our side  but which were distorted by biased powerful interests.242.	First  all the foreign nationals asked to go are being allowed to take personal belongings as well as reasonable amounts of cash with them  which is to be delimited by our financial resources.243.	Second  there has never been  contrary to astounding allegations of the British Secretary of State  no confiscation of any property belonging to any of the departing aliens. All those who have property in Uganda have been asked to make an inventory of such property on forms which have been provided by our Ministry of Commerce and on the basis of which such property will be sold and the proceeds credited to the accounts of its owners. With regard to those who have bank accounts  such accounts are intact and the money still belongs to them.244.	Third  it is not the intention  nor has it ever been the intention  of the Uganda Government to maltreat the departing aliens. Their transit out of the country  from the capital city  Kampala  to the international airport from which they fly out  is protected by well-organized police escorts to avoid any embarrassing incidents.245.	Fourth  it is not  nor has it ever been  the intention of the Uganda Government to maltreat or otherwise oppress any non-citizen who at the end of the deadline of 90 days might still remain in Uganda. This is a critical undertaking which should satisfy ail those concerned. It means that those aliens who will still be in the country at the end of the deadline will still enjoy their lives as human beings and that my Government  in recognition of its international obligations  will still accord to them the same protection as it accords to all other foreign nationals resident in our country who are staying there. This  of course  will be so provided that efforts to facilitate the exit of the departing aliens to their new homes are not deliberately slowed down or frustrated.246.	In this connexion  I wish to point out that the British Asians themselves are satisfied with the arrangements of the Uganda Government  pending their departure. I shall quote from an interview in The Times of London of 27 September 1972  given by a Mr. V. V. Radia  a former Chairman of the Uganda Chamber of Commerce  when he said  together with a colleague:""It is the British High Commission"" that is  the British Embassy in Kampala-""that is holding up the exodus of the Asians  not the Uganda authorities  who have set up excellent machinery. .. .""Among a number of specific demands  they""-that is  Mr. Radia and another person-""asked that the British High Commission should remain open 'around the clock'.""The two men claimed that the High Commission is open only five hours a day during the week and is closed at weekends. In contrast  they pointed out that the Bank of Uganda and other local government offices were remaining open throughout weekends to deal with the Asians. . ."".One can therefore realize from this that my Government intends to discharge its own share of obligations  but those others involved must correspondingly do likewise.247.	Let me  on behalf of my Government  express our deep appreciation to those countries which have offered entry to these departing aliens. We have given these aliens sanctuary for over 80 years  and we recognize your goodwill in offering to share our problem. A few speakers from this rostrum made some remarks that were most unbecoming to their positions. But  obviously  our opinion of them must have been quite exaggerated.248.	I cannot conclude this general statement without reference to the OAU. The Uganda Government attaches great importance to the role that regional organizations can play in facilitating the implementation of the objectives of the United Nations. A strong and purposeful OAU will add immensely to the purposefulness and effectiveness of this Organization.249.	The last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at Rabat took some well-considered and specific decisions  on the issues that have for so long engaged us in this Assembly the issues that concern the rights of many millions in Africa who still labor under the despicable yoke of outmoded  indefensible  unpardonable  atrocious colonial rule  and the rule of minority racist regimes. We expect this session to take up the substance of the decisions made at Rabat and to give them practical meaning.250.	Members must be aware of the current events in East Africa which seemingly show a very disturbing trend for our region. But it is our hope and belief that the efforts by our brothers within the OAU that are already underway will provide a solution to this and other problems  to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned  since the heritage we share in that region far exceeds any transitory misunderstandings we may presently have.251.	The OAU has not been just a talking club. It has  within less than a decade of existence  demonstrated its practical value in its ability to defuse or solve potentially grave situations on our continent among its member States. It is the intention of my Government to continue strengthening this role of the OAU.252.	Finally  as a general observation  let me reaffirm the belief of my country in the role that the non-aligned countries can play to promote world peace and understanding. True  most of the non-aligned world consists of developing nations. But it is our hope that none here will  either publicly or secretly  equate superior technology with superior wisdom  or  put differently  that none can seriously contend that because we are technologically underdeveloped  we are therefore under-developed in human wisdom and common sense.253.	Let us recall that the greatest sages of all time  men we today constantly turn to for reference and guidance on human problems  like Socrates  Plato  Confucius  Mohammed  Buddha or Jesus  did not live in a mechanized world; they lived in conditions that could today be called primitive by our standards. But they possessed a profound understanding of human nature which  regrettably perhaps  has changed so little over the millenia.254.	Similarly  from the non-aligned may well come some contribution to a better world which the big Powers would do well to ponder. We diminish rather than crystallize polarities. We offer a meeting point  in ideas and action  that might be impossible to attain by either side in the ideological contest. But we have no desire to be a battleground because  as we say in Africa  when two elephants fight it is the grass that suffers.255.	In a real sense the United Nations is not weak nor has it failed. If it seems to be weak  it is because its Members are weak in their resolution to make it strong. If it seems to have failed  it is because self-interest among Member States transcends their will to make it succeed. Rather than turn on the United Nations in anger and frustration at its impotence  let us direct our indictment where it is properly due  to those Member States whose declarations of high ideals are equally matched by their capacity to deny them fulfillment.256.	It is the hope of my delegation that this twenty- seventh session will rise to its high calling  as the world expects it to do; that at long last  no matter how difficult  it will begin to seek to implement the multitude of resolutions that the General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted on varied topics over the years. Let us restore faith in this Organization among all the millions on our planet."
"117",7129,"UKR",27,1972,"Mr. President  permit me on behalf of the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet SocialistRepublic to offer you our warm congratulations on your election to the important office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success. We are particularly gratified that this high honor has been conferred on you  the representative of a neighboring socialist country  with whose people the Ukrainian people are linked by ties of fraternal co-operation in the struggle for our common ideals.59.	We should also like to extend our greetings to the Secretary-General and express our best wishes for the success of his work.60.	Despite all the differences of approach to the assessment of individual international events  the present debate highlights  as a characteristic feature of the period which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly  the undeniable fact that peaceful coexistence is becoming a palpable  living reality on our troubled planet.61.	Of course  this is not a spontaneous development. It has grown out of the arduous struggle between the champions of peace and their opponents. But the idea of peaceful coexistence between State""  is gradually winning over more and more countries and Governments. In this connexion  it can be said that  in the final analysis  the debate in the United Nations is promoting a better understanding of positions and arguments and is helping to narrow the differences between points of view and  in a number of cases  to remove certain historical barriers on the road to mutual understanding.62.	It is clear that the peoples cannot be satisfied by mere words  no matter how high-flown and eloquent they may be.63.	Life has always put actions above words  especially when questions of peace and international security are involved. In this context  it is appropriate to refer to one of the pronouncements of V. I. Lenin  the founder of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of which will be celebrated by all Soviet peoples in December of this year. Lenin said that it was precisely on such a question as the struggle for peace  which was so vitally important for all peoples  that it was desirable:... to see a minimum of general declarations  solemn promises and grandiloquent formulas and the greatest possible number of very simple and clear decisions and measures which might really lead to peace  if not to the complete elimination of the danger of war"". 64.	The past year has marked a new stage in the relaxation of international tension. Quite a lot has already been done in the way of the practical and business-like  purposeful solution of questions relating to the establishment of lasting peace. This makes our hope that the principle of peaceful coexistence and non-use of force in relations between countries can and will be raised to the status of an immutable law of international life appear all the more realistic.65.	The Ukrainian SSR attributes the positive results which have been achieved principally to the successful implementation by the Soviet Union of the program of peace put forward at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  to the vigorous foreign policy activities of the socialist countries and to the fact that the Governments of a number of other States have adopted realistic peace-loving policies. That is why the cause of peace can now count to its credit such momentous developments as the entry into force of the treaties concluded in 1972 by the Federal Republic of Germany with the Soviet Union and with Poland  the further expansion of co-operation between the USSR and France and other States  specific action in the preparation of an all-European conference on security and co-operation  the initiative regarding the convening of a world disarmament conference  the proposal regarding the establishment of a collective security system in Asia  and so on. Special mention should be made of the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States which resulted in the conclusion between those two countries of important agreements the implementation of which will clearly serve the interests of all States and the cause of universal peace. Even those who continue to slander the Soviet Union and its peace-loving foreign policy have been compelled to acknowledge the importance of this event.66.	At this point I should like to stress that the Ukrainian people  in common with all Soviet people  ardently supports the practical measures which are being implemented by the Communist Party and the Government of the Soviet Union and by the countries of the socialist community with a view to bringing about detente and the further strengthening of peace and security.67.	We all know that the policy of peaceful coexistence does not eliminate the contradictions  particularly the ideological contradictions  between the two social systems. But the vitality and effectiveness of this policy lies in the very fact that it is designed to exclude the solution of conflicts by military means. Thus  the encouraging purport of the positive actions I have referred to gains even greater significance: they demonstrate the strength of the very principle of peaceful coexistence and they militate against those who would wish to aggravate the international situation and prevent detente.68.	In this connexion  we consider that the General Assembly can record the achievement of positive results in the implementation of the basis provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. However  we cannot fail to express our deep concern at the continued existence of hotbeds of war in various parts of the world. We think that the General Assembly might call upon all States to take effective measures to facilitate the elimination of existing hotbeds of war and prevent armed conflicts.69.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR holds the view that the adoption by the United Nations of the Soviet proposal on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [A/8793] would be an important political step towards a decisive diminution of the menace of war  the elimination and prevention of acts of armed aggression and the threat of a nuclear holocaust. In his statement [2040th meeting]  Mr. Gromyko  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  put forward exhaustive arguments in support of this important political proposal.70.	The Ukrainian delegation fully supports the Soviet draft resolution on this matter [A/L.676]  and is convinced that the solution of the vitally important problems raised in it will undoubtedly meet the aspirations of all peace-loving peoples.71.	Attention at this session is focused on a number of important contemporary problems  but one thing is clear: the proposal on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is of supreme importance for the whole of humanity. Indeed  if relations between States are based on the principle of the non-use of force and if at the same time there is a permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  no one will be able to resort to the use of either nuclear or conventional weapons. What will then prevent humanity from entering upon an era of lasting peace  genuine international security  and general and complete disarmament?72.	Of course  we must not forget that peoples are fighting against colonial subjugation and imperialist invaders or that there exists the danger of new acts of aggression. The Soviet proposal in no way infringes upon the right of peoples to defend themselves against aggression and to carry on the struggle for national liberation  by armed force if necessary. And there is no contradiction in this  for the United Nations has also reaffirmed this right in its decisions and declarations. Thus  the Soviet proposal  advocating the prohibition of the use both of force and of nuclear weapons  takes into account the vitally important interests of all nations and States  large and small  nuclear and non-nuclear  developed and developing.73.	From this lofty rostrum  the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR calls upon the representatives of all States Members of the United Nations to support the USSR proposal on non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons.74.	Nowadays  perhaps  there is no need to try to convince anyone that the establishment of a security system in Europe is the key to the strengthening of peace throughout the world. We are all aware that many of the obstacles erected by certain NATO circles to the convening of an all-European conference and the establishment of collective security in Europe have already been removed. At the Assembly of Representatives of Public Opinion for European Security and Co-operation  held at  Brussels in June  the powerful voice of the peoples of Europe cried out for a positive solution to this problem. The necessary pre-conditions have now been created for businesslike multilateral consultations on the immediate preparation and holding of the conference.75.	It is natural that the Government of every European State should make its contribution to this common effort  if it really cares about the security of its country and wishes to transform our continent into a land of peace and fruitful co-operation.76.	This is precisely the approach of the German Democratic Republic that powerful bulwark of European and world peace. We know from experience that many important world problems cannot be solved effectively without the participation of the German Democratic Republic. Moreover  the new political situation taking shape in Europe  the interests of the further strengthening of peace and international co-operation and the interests of enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations all demand  more urgently than every before  the immediate admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations. The question of the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations must be resolved at the same time.77.	The general trend towards the easing of tension and the strengthening of regional security is also having a favorable effect in other parts of the world  including Asia. Events taking place in the Far East are of significance in this respect.78.	It cannot be disputed that the interests of peace in that part of the world demand an improvement in the situation on the Korean peninsula and the reunification of Korea on a peaceful  democratic basis  without any kind of foreign interference. An important dialog is now in progress between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea. In these circumstances the United Nations should have felt itself obliged to promote the creation of conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea.79.	Unfortunately  we have had a show of political nonsense. Under the influence of forces opposed to the easing of tension  the General Assembly has once again decided to postpone consideration of the Korean question until its next session. Once again the policies of those who oppose the withdrawal of the troops stationed in Korea under the United Nations flag and the dissolution of the infamous United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea have prevailed. Thus  the obstacle to the realization of the national aspirations of the Korean people has not yet been removed.80.	The flames of armed conflict on the Indian subcontinent have been extinguished. Constructive negotiations are now in progress between India and Pakistan. The further strengthening of peace and security in that part of the world will depend on good-neighborly relations between the countries in that region. As we all know  out of this dramatic situation has been born a new peace-loving State-the People's Republic of Bangladesh. We think that the opposition of those who  because of their great-Power chauvinistic ambitions  are obstructing the admission of that State to the United Nations will be overcome and that the Republic of Bangladesh will inevitably occupy its place in the United Nations.81.	We consider that the United Nations should now seek with greater energy and perseverance to achieve the elimination of existing hotbeds of aggression and to put an end to the armed conflicts unleashed by imperialism.82.	The bloody war in IndoChina continues. For the time being those who plan and carry on this war are not seeking constructive decisions to end the aggression in Viet-Nam but  rather  are trying to prolong and even escalate the war and are devising means of deceiving both their own people and international public opinion. In the guise of speeches about their peace-loving intentions they are continuously putting forward new pretexts and false arguments to justify their aggressive military actions.83.	The United States reduces the number of its land forces in South Viet-Nam  but immediately replaces them with Saigon troops. It has increased to 100 000 the total strength of the armed forces engaged in the war of extermination from the air and the sea  while the bombing of towns  villages  dikes and dams in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is being intensified on an unprecedented scale. This is how the ""VietNamization"" program which the United States is carrying out appears in practice.84.	The aggressor should understand by now that in today's world the policy of negotiating ""from a position of strength"" is doomed to failure  for the peoples which have risen up to fight for their freedom and independence are invincible. They have on their side the socialist countries  which are rendering them aid and support in their just struggle; they also have the sympathy and support of all peace-loving peoples and the whole of progressive humanity.85.	The Ukrainian SSR is a firm advocate of the immediate cessation of aggression in Viet-Nam and of the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  and the complete and unconditional withdrawal from that part of the world of the forces of the United States and its allies. It considers that the key to a peaceful settlement of the problem of IndoChina is to be found in the constructive proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam  the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the patriotic forces of Laos and Cambodia.86.	The situation in the Middle East  which has arisen as a result of Israeli aggression  poses a threat to universal peace and international security.87.	The latest acts of aggression by the Israeli militarists against Lebanon and Syria reveal once again the expansionist nature of the policies of the Israeli Government. Using the tragic incident in Munich as a pretext for their notorious acts of ""retaliation"" and a further build-up of tension  the Israeli leaders have recently been reiterating their intention to seek ""substantial border changes"". It is no secret that Israel is able to pursue its adventurist policy and defy the United Nations thanks to the backers who render it unlimited military  financial and political aid and support. Surely they realize in Tel Aviv that no lavish hand-outs can save their reckless policy from complete failure.88.	In its demands  the Ukrainian SSR is at one with the forces of peace: the hotbed of aggression in the Middle East must be eliminated; Israeli troops must be withdrawn from the occupied territories; full recognition must be given to the independence and sovereignty of all States and to the lawful rights of all peoples in that part of the world  including the Arab people of Palestine.89.	I should like to add the following to what I have already said.90.	A few days ago  the General Assembly witnessed another of the routine rhetorical exercises of the Israeli Foreign Minister. Its aim was the same as before to attempt yet again to evade responsibility for the ceaseless acts of aggression against neighboring Arab States  for the terrorism and for all the crimes committed in the occupied territories.91.	As a result of the growing condemnation of 1 policies by world public opinion  Israel finds itself in a state of increasing political isolation. It was this  no doubt  which prompted the representative of Tel Aviv to interfere once again  in a crude and impudent manner  in the internal affairs of the Soviet State by resorting to the routine fabrication  as deceitful as ever  about the alleged discrimination in the USSR against citizens of Jewish nationality.92.	We in the Ukraine say of a person who goes about making irrelevant  unfounded and absurd allegations that he ""pops up like a jack-in-the-box"". It was in just such an unenviable position that the Israeli Foreign Minister found himself.93.	Our delegation attaches particular importance to the problem of disarmament. After all  it is hardly possible to talk at all seriously about genuine international security without effective disarmament measures and the cessation of the arms race. In recent years a number of useful international agreements have been concluded on arms limitation and on certain measures for partial disarmament  particularly important among which is the recently adopted Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex].94.	The question of the complete prohibition of chemical weapons is next in line.95.	As one of the sponsors of the relevant draft convention [see A/8818-DC/235  annex B (CCD/361)]  submitted on 28 March 1972 by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  the Ukrainian SSR considers that the draft constitutes a good basis for reaching agreement. We cannot regard as tenable the positions of certain Powers which are attempting to impede the solution of the question of the prohibition of chemical weapons by bringing up various technical problems*.96.	It is the duty of the General Assembly to call upon all States to solve this problem at the earliest possible moment on the only possible basis  namely  by taking a political decision on the complete prohibition of these weapons of mass destruction. The existence of chemical weapons in the arsenals of certain States and their use against peoples fighting for their liberation make this task one of particular urgency.97.	In its reply to the Secretary-General on the question of convening a world disarmament conference  the Government of the Ukrainian SSR has set forth its views on the preparation and holding of such a conference [A/8817 annex]. We believe that  as a result of the wide-spread support for the convening of a world disarmament conference  this session of the General Assembly will consider and decide questions relating to the preparation and holding of the conference.98.	The agenda of this session includes problems connected with the peaceful use of outer space. While reserving the right to express our views on some of these problems in greater detail at a later stage  we should like to urge all delegations to support the constructive proposal of the Soviet Union on the preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting [A/8771]. The adoption of this proposal will ensure that world-wide television broadcasting is carried on with strict respect for the national sovereignty of all countries in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and strengthening co-operation among nations.99.	In their statements  many delegations have expressed concern that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  the program of action  and relevant United Nations resolutions have not yet been implemented in some parts of the world. Events in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) show that the colonialists are persisting in their attempts to crush the national liberation movement of the African peoples. The ruling circles of some Western Powers and their powerful monopolies  which have long been protecting and lending money to colonial regimes  are now quite openly rendering aid to the rulers in Pretoria  Salisbury and Lisbon  supplying them with arms and cynically violating the embargo on trade with the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.100.	In these circumstances it is essential to give further support to the forces opposed to imperialism and colonialism and to help them to intensify their struggle for the elimination of the vestiges of colonialism and racism. At the same time  the United Nations must take further decisive action to complete the process of decolonization. The United Nations could make a positive contribution to the implementation of international action in the struggle against racism and the inhuman policy and practice of racism and apartheid by adopting a convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid. It should not be forgotten that the need to conclude such a convention was recognized by the General Assembly in resolution 2786 (XXVI).101.	The developing countries find themselves in a particularly difficult situation as a result of the present acute aggravation of the crisis in the capitalist monetary system and the consequent unhealthy condition of the world economy  for the backward economies which they inherited from colonialism are heavily dependent on external markets and on external sources for many vitally important goods.102.	The Ukrainian people have learned through their own experience that the difficulties facing developing countries can be overcome by firm and consistent implementation of radical social and economic reforms and by establishing a public sector in the economy of the country and changing the structure of social production. This will create the conditions for mobilizing resources on a national scale  speeding up economic development on the basis of modern scientific and technological advances  and strengthening the position of national economies in the struggle against foreign monopolies.103.	By pursuing this policy  the Ukraine  which was formerly a backward  illiterate country  with an economy dependent on foreign capital  has been transformed during the Soviet period into a highly developed industrial Power. The founding of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a truly historic event in the destiny of our people. The selfless labor of the Ukrainian people and the brotherly friendship and mutual assistance of all the peoples of the USSR have helped the Ukraine to establish an economy in which crises are unknown  to achieve a high level of cultural development and to consolidate social relations based upon genuine social and national equality. Tremendous social reforms in the name of humanity have not been the only result of the unification of the peoples of our land into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That unification  as was rightly pointed out by Mr. Shcherbitsky  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  has shown the whole world:""... the only true way to overcome national enmity  to abolish inequality among nations  to guarantee the free development of peoples and to achieve the firm consolidation and unification of their efforts to secure a brighter future"". (From his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine on 27 July 1972  published in Pravda Ukraine of 28 July 1972).104.	We are convinced that the United Nations should promote such measures as would encourage the development of international co-operation in industrial production  the development and utilization of natural resources  the protection of the human environment  and other areas of mutual interest. This is the way to raise the economic standard of all countries and achieve the further strengthening of security and trust among nations.105.	At this session  some States are still advocating the revision of the United Nations Charter. It is argued that our Charter has become ""obsolete""  and some people even assert that it does not reflect the positions of the dozens of new States which have been admitted to the United Nations since its foundation.106.	The Ukrainian SSR  one of the founder Members of the United Nations  well remembers the arduous battles against fascism in which was forged the victory which made possible the establishment of this international Organization. That victory cost our people incalculable sacrifices and sufferings. Consequently  the cause of peace and international security  a case which is fully served by the provisions of the Charter  its spirit and its letter  is especially dear to us.107.	No  it is not the ""obsolescence"" of the Charter or a revision of the Charter or a revision of its principles that we should be concerned with! A careful analysis of United Nations activities during the past 27 years will show that they might have been immeasurably more fruitful and effective if all Members had adhered unswervingly to the letter and spirit of the Charter and if all States without exception had conducted their foreign policy strictly in accordance with its principles. The shortcomings in the activities of the United Nations are not due to the Charter in its present form  but rather to violations of its provisions. The Charter cannot fail to correspond to the interests of the young developing States  for it gives legal confirmation to the progressive principles of international law equality of rights  self-determination of peoples  sovereign equality and respect for human rights the very principles which have served and continue to serve young developing States as reliable legal instruments in their struggle for genuine national independence.108.	To attempt to revise the Charter is to undermine the fundamental principles of the United Nations embodied in our Charter  which is a modern code for international co-operation between States on the basis of equality or rights.109.	A number of the problems submitted for consideration at this session are of supreme importance for the cause of universal peace. They are the problems of life itself  dictated by the fundamental interests of peoples thirsting for peace  prosperity and progress. The United Nations bears a great responsibility at this time  when powerful forces of peace are compelling us to direct our efforts towards detente and the strengthening of co-operation. The Ukrainian delegation considers it the primary duty and immediate task of the United Nations at the twenty-seventh session of its General Assembly  not to let slip the opportunity to work out and adopt at this session such decisions as will promote the development of far-reaching international co-operation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence."
"118",7176,"URY",27,1972,"My country is once again attending the General Assembly in the same spirit of co-operation and hope as has always prompted us in regard to the vast objectives the world Organization is called upon to fulfill. I should like to express first of all my congratulations on the wise election to the presidency of the Assembly of the representative of Poland  whose eminent qualifications and dedication to the cause of the international Organization give us a complete guarantee of his conduct in such a prominent post.97.	The present session enables us to renew the periodic analysis of the status of the compliance or response of the United Nations in regard to the complex problems which have arisen in our community.98.	In my opinion  important progress has been achieved despite the recognized shortcomings of a system which has not yet reached the desired affirmation of a new international order. Nevertheless  none can fail to recognize that in the 27 years of the existence of the Organization we have witnessed a forward movement of a universal concert of the most varied tendencies  marching towards the erection of a global structure of mankind  bringing closer communications and closer political and social interactions among peoples  without the abandonment by those peoples of their special characteristics  whether of culture  religion  race or otherwise. This enables us to understand the difficulties for an Organization which has not yet achieved its full development in fulfilling the main purposes which led to its establishment.99.	Uruguay had the privilege of being part of the original group of the United Nations and at San Francisco we accepted the reality of the great Powers  which were largely entrusted with the maintenance of peace  so that by this means they could facilitate social progress and the raising of the standard of living of all peoples and respect for the obligations flowing from treaties and other sources of international law.100.	Confronted with the picture now before us in 1972  we find a fact which is up to a point encouraging in ensuring that responsibility of the great Powers for peace. Obviously there has been progress  since there has been a lessening of tension between the great Powers. Together with the universality we have approached with the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations  we also have observed better prospects in the relations between the permanent members of the Security Council  in such a way that we can think that increasingly any idea of a third world war or of a conflict which would threaten the existence of our planet is being further removed.101.	The Secretary-General of the United Nations has just affirmed that ""the process of detente among the great Powers is certainly a historic event of the highest importance"" [A/8701fAdd.1  p. 1]. This fact has led to what has been called a ""balance of prudence"" and permits us to hope for better results in the not-too-distant future. Despite these encouraging circumstances in which understanding and negotiations have begun in areas in which before they only moved within an atmosphere of confrontation  it has not yet been possible to eliminate conflicts which entail military hostilities  with great human losses  serious destruction and innocent victims  because of acts of violence and uncontrolled aggression. It has become obvious that the United Nations has not been able to put an end to or resolve these situations which have so gravely threatened peace and which in some cases have unleashed actual armed conflicts  which we still witness with grief  because of the powerlessness of the means called upon to maintain peace and security  indeed the principal objective of our Organization.102.	It would be unfair not to recognize the position in the world with regard to colonial liberation  which is a primary task of the United Nations. The history of mankind has accelerated dramatically in recent years in a direction favorable to mankind. The liberation which has been achieved is an admirable success of this Organization  which has been able to overcome the barriers of despotism and the scourge of colonial exploitation as part of an effort of immense courage and social redemption  which makes it possible to see many peoples now among the free nations after a lengthy period of decolonization. As a citizen of Uruguay I observe the often tragic history of the independence of our countries of Latin America  with constellations of glorious deeds and warlike struggles  and I think that we did not have this tremendous accelerating drive which in recent times has been the decisive work of our community in action. This has created an international conscience which fights more effectively than armies themselves in those areas where complete liberation has not been attained and where barbarism and oppression still reign. We have worked out new formulas to resolve injustice and imbalance among the nations  applying to international life the inspired concept of complete equality of rights for all human beings. That is the task which our Organization has started in order to bring closer together nations which at times remained apart because of external influences or hegemonies  or for other sterile motives  nations which we now see coming together under the imperative course of history  compelling us to bring justice and well-being to all the areas of the world  which today we see united into a single territory destined for development and universal progress. The rate of these conquests is still slow  but they proceed inexorably.103.	We consider the initiation of contacts between governments such as those of South and North Korea to be auspicious and we predict fruitful results from these initial understandings  as well as from those between the two German States  which have been able to find a more favorable path towards a rapprochement. The Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 between India and Pakistan can also be mentioned as an event full of good prospects capable of permitting a permanent peace between those great nations of Asia. With regard to the Middle East  we are saddened by the repetition of events which prevent the consolidation of a state of peace for the region  which in our opinion could only be achieved by the complete application of all the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).104.	Our country maintains excellent relations with the Arab States and with the State of Israel and tries to maintain an impartial position which will permit it  as a Member of the United Nations  to do its utmost to co-operate towards a conciliation which is becoming increasingly urgent and necessary. Uruguay has distinguished groups and contingents of Arabs and Jews in its territory and has also received members of other communities  such as the Armenians  who have found protection and shelter with us as host country and as a free refuge for immigrants  the • dispossessed and the exiles of the world. These communities have become bulwarks of civilization and progress in our midst and live together peacefully. Today they enjoy full citizenship  and we want justice and well-being for all  while respecting the traditions of their countries of origin. It is to be hoped that as negotiations and dialogs go on in other areas of the world it will also be possible to open up similar prospects in the Middle East between States and peoples which are today separated and which history has called upon to live together as good neighbors and to co-operate in progress not only in that area but in the world as a whole.105.	We cannot fail to mention the burning issues related to the still existing colonialism and the conditions which the African nations consider to be essential to complete the total liberation of their continent.106.	Our country has played an important role in the process of decolonization. We were members of  and presided over  the former Committee on South West Africa and we were members of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples from its establishment and for seven years. In all forums Uruguay has advocated greater speed in meeting the task of contributing to the achievement of independence by all those territories.107.	We do not abdicate today our position of yesterday when we point out that the work which remains can only be carried out with respect for the principles of our Charter and its standards  since these achievements will be final only when they bear the imprint of international law. The path of international law and justice is at times a painful one  but it is increasingly less slow  as is proved by the presence here of so many sovereign nations; but it is the only course we can follow to put an end to colonial domination and discrimination of any kind whatsoever.108.	As regards natural resources and the law of the sea  we have reached a point at which the imperatives of technology  science and conservation itself may come into conflict with archaic concepts and the most deep-rooted nationalism. We must find a way to build a world in harmony with these new realities. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June 1972  proved to us the urgency with which we must set out to resolve these pressing problems.109.	A new law of the sea is the most important event in this field and a growing number of States have extended their maritime jurisdiction with the object of preserving and making better use of those vast areas for the benefit of their peoples  for whom they are often the primary source of survival. A large number of countries of Latin America favor an extension of their territorial waters to 200 miles. In this field significant progress is being made in finding criteria which will make it possible to present a common front  whatever the name given to the territorial sea: economic sea  or patrimonial sea  or zone of conservation of the species or of the right to fisheries.110.	At the. same time that we hope to arrive at satisfactory solutions in this field we recognize also the importance of establishing a regime for the sea-bed and the breadth of the territorial sea* The Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session [resolution 2749 (XXV)] is of outstanding importance in that it establishes the principles that are to govern the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof. In that resolution the United Nations has declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  together with the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor  are the common heritage of mankind. In this sense  no State may claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part whatsoever of the oceanic area. We hope that the conference on the law of the sea that is to be convened next year will be able to consider these specific points and that it will succeed in offering solutions that will take into account the fundamental interests of all countries not only the coastal countries that are to benefit by the international regime that is to be established.111.	The problems of the human environment and the results of the Stockholm Conference will undoubtedly call for special attention from the present session of the General Assembly.112.	It cannot be denied that modern civilization has had as its consequence  in addition to inestimable progress  serious shifts in natural ecology  alterations in the environment and the indiscriminate exploitation of the flora and fauna of the earth  as well as the grave harm done through air pollution.113.	The Latin American Regional Seminar on problems of the Human Environment and Development  held in Mexico City in September of last year  established that the principal source of environmental' pollution and the pollution of water  land and sea on the international level must be attributed principally to the activities and policies of the developed countries.114.	The problems of human environment and development undoubtedly reveal differences among the industrialized States and those in the process of development. Therefore  action intended to preserve a sound ecological balance will require international co-operation in the sense of a general mobilization involving specific solutions for each region  so as to promote material development and the greatest possible prosperity for humanity in all parts of the earth.115.	Turning to the matter of international economy and trade  the Second United Nations Development Decade has not shown any success in the effective fulfillment of its programs  but there do exist encouraging signs in the co-operation between prosperous nations and those in the process of development.116.	The third session of UNCTAD  held in Santiago  Chile  last April and May  produced no concrete results in some very sensitive areas  but it did nevertheless represent a step forward and it emphasized the need for rapidly finding suitable functional means for reducing the existing imbalance. In the field of international trade  some results have been achieved that must be supplemented by increasing assistance from the world institutions of credit and financing. Only through the effective utilization of the resources of the developing countries and the transformation and expansion of units of production  together with the required transfer of technology  can an acceptable economic balance be achieved.117.	We wish  further  to repeat our most resolute support for special consideration of the international monetary situation. In particular  and in connexion with the Inter-national Monetary Fund  it seems to us that the time has come to make its procedures more flexible  adjusting them in clearer fashion to the specific conditions of the member countries.118.	We agree with the position maintained by the developing countries  which have affirmed their vital interests and their full right to participate in most active fashion in all aspects connected with reform of the international monetary system. Likewise  we believe that  when the reform is carried out  special consideration must be given to the fact that it should facilitate additional aid for development and should not represent simply an instrument for consolidating the situation at present prevailing.119.	The Government of Uruguay firmly supports the initiative of the Secretary-General in submitting to this General Assembly a request for the consideration of the problem of terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l] with a view to having it adopt effective measures for the prevention and repression of terrorist acts. I should like to recall that  at the last session of the General Assembly  on behalf of my country I submitted a working paper concerning the question  which contained a draft convention for consideration by the International Law Commission to ensure that the problem would be considered at this session of the Assembly. On that occasion I stated to the Assembly the following:""In addition to the many different forms of social disturbance which have occurred in various countries and have affected a large number of members of the inter-national community  there has been a widespread increase in violence  crime  thefts and hijackings."" [1941st meeting  para. 129.]Recently occurring events in various parts of the world demonstrate how urgent it is that this matter be dealt with so that international action may be taken to defend the community from the continually occurring crimes afflicting it.120.	International terrorism has taken on an extraordinary virulence in recent days  and this crime  in all its varied forms  assailing as it does the values consecrated by the civilized conscience and attacking innocent victims in absolutely cold blood  constitutes a constant terror which the international community cannot disregard  and the latter must therefore react in defense of the peace and tranquility of all peoples.121.	When I raised this item last year  I stated that Uruguay had  in this regard  lived through an experience unique in its history [ibid.]. I added that  to the challenge thrown in its face  our country responded with all the vigor of its free institutions  with full adherence to its constitutional standards and with the election of its leaders  held at the regular times specified by its constitution  and accompanied by broad and free election campaigning amid the full exercise of its parliamentary procedures and the absolute authority of its institutions of justice [ibid.  para. 130]. The doctrine governing Uruguay in the face of violence was that of strengthening law and the rule of law.122.	To us  the answer to violence must be the firm application of the law. In that connexion  we approve the idea of agreeing on an international convention to establish positive applicable provisions for preventing  or applying. sanctions to  crimes of terrorism in their various manifestations.123.	We cannot accept terrorist methods as a legitimate weapon of political action. In this connexion the people of my country  in the last elections which were held at the end of last year  showed its total repudiation of such methods and firmly supported democratic institutions and the consolidation of its institutional life  which had been gravely threatened. Those circumstances enabled President Bordaberry  shortly after taking power  to arrive at a national agreement between the traditional political parties and immediately and emphatically to start the struggle against violence. President Bordaberry said that the confrontation with that state of subversion was difficult because of the absence of legal texts which would have authorized the Government to undertake really effective action. He added that in our opinion  it is essential that the political parties should reach agreement to alter the existing legal texts in such a way that  while respecting individual rights-and it could not be otherwise-the public power would be enabled effectively to deal with the situations which it was facing.124.	That is the contribution which Uruguay  within its limited resources  has been able to make in the defense of human values and the legal and social order  when it is confronted with crimes of violence.125.	We hope that the results of the studies and the resolutions which will be adopted on the basis of the drafts submitted will make it possible to take positive steps in the defense of man and his fundamental rights  which constitute the high goals my country has fought for throughout its history. Those are the same purposes and principles established by the Charter of the United Nations to ensure peace throughout the world  and we are at the service of these purposes and principles of our world Organization."
"119",7223,"USA",27,1972,"During the past few years the world has made remarkable advances toward the Charter goal of practicing tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors.45.	In 1972 alone  the United States and the Soviet Union have undertaken with each other to do their utmost to avoid military confrontations  to respect the sovereign equality of all countries and to promote conditions in which no country would be subject to outside interference in its internal affairs. The Soviet Union and the United States have also placed precise limitations on our defensive and  at least for the next five years  on our offensive strategic missile systems. The United States and the People's Republic of China have undertaken to broaden the understanding between our peoples  to improve relations between us in the conviction that this would be in the interests of all States  and to oppose any efforts to establish hegemony in Asia or toward division of the world into spheres of influence. The United Kingdom  France  the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed on specific provisions to ensure unimpeded movement to and from Berlin by road  rail and waterways. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have opened negotiations on a treaty to normalize their relations. And North and South Korea have intensified their talks on the plight of divided families and have agreed to establish a joint committee to examine problems of unification.46.	There have been many other accomplishments in pursuance of the Charter's objectives in 1972. I mention these merely to illustrate how old patterns of hostility are being eroded. If continued  this process will in time find positive reflection within the United Nations itself.47.	We are encouraged  too  by calls in both Eastern and Western capitals for a more secure and open Europe. A step toward realizing this goal would be the creation of a more stable military balance in central Europe through negotiation of mutual and balanced force reductions. We are currently in consultation with our allies  and we believe exploratory talks on this subject could begin within the next several months. We trust they will be productive.48.	It is equally important to move toward more normal relationships in Europe relationships which have not existed since the end of the Second World War. Toward this objective  a conference on security and co-operation in Europe  if it is carefully and constructively prepared  could play a crucial role. A conference whose over-all effect was to put a stamp of approval upon the rigid divisions of Europe would only prolong the problems of today into yet another generation. On the other hand  a conference which promoted a more normal relationship among all of Europe's States and peoples would reinforce the trend toward better relations on other levels. That is why we believe that the conference must take practical steps to promote the freer movement of people  ideas and goods across the breadth of the continent.49.	We are also now studying alternative approaches for the forthcoming Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The United States will pursue the following general aims. First  our endeavor will be to negotiate on offensive weapons. In so doing we shall seek to expand the scope of strategic offensive weapons included in the limitations and to establish an equitable balance in the major delivery systems. Second  we shall wish to examine carefully qualitative limitations which could enhance stability. Third  we will aim to reduce levels of strategic arms. As President Nixon said to this General Assembly in 1969  our objective is "".. . not only to limit the build-up of strategic arms  but to reverse it.""50.	Of course we also attach importance to the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  which has now turned its attention to preventing the accumulation of chemical weapons for use in warfare. Work in that Committee has come a long way towards resolving some of the important and complex issues related to possible significant restraints in this area. The United States is intensifying its study of all proposals and we look forward to responding to them at an early date.51.	It is clear from what I have said that the United States believes that a practical step-by-step approach is the best way to achieve genuine progress m disarmament.52.	Let me take note of other areas in the world in which progress needs to be accelerated.53.	In Africa  this Assembly must continue to champion the efforts of all peoples of all races to secure human dignity  self-determination and social justice. The United States will continue to lend its full support to all practical efforts to those ends.54.	In Latin America  while growth rates in recent years have far exceeded Alliance for Progress targets  economic development is still a primary concern and a primary need. The United States Government remains committed to a substantial program of economic assistance  particularly through regional organizations. And  in recognition of the importance of trade to development  we are actively supporting the participation of Latin American and other developing countries in the coming negotiations on a new international monetary system.55.	In Viet-Nam the United States has reduced its armed forces from about 550 000 to 35 000. President Nixon has proposed a cease-fire in all of IndoChina under international supervision  an exchange of prisoners of war  and a total withdrawal of United States forces. Under this proposal the political future of Viet-Nam could be negotiated by the VietNamese themselves. President Nixon has also pledged a major effort to assist both VietNamese States in post-war reconstruction. In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the other side persists in believing that the war should be continued.   56.	And in the Middle East  the momentum towards a peace settlement must be regained. We should take note of two positive elements. First  the cease-fire is now in its twenty-sixth month. Second  the climate for a settlement seemed to improve very much as 1972 progressed. We must  however  recognize that the Munich killings have set off deplorable patterns of action and reaction and I emphasize that the United States believes that both action and reaction are deplorable-and that these patterns have seriously clouded the prospects for early progress. Nevertheless  neither side has permanently closed the door to future diplomatic efforts. We believe that the forces favoring a peaceful settlement still have the upper hand. Our task in this Assembly  our task individually as representatives of nations  is to do everything possible to see that the forces that favor a peaceful settlement are supported.57.	The ""no war  no peace"" situation which prevails now in the Middle East does not and will not serve the interest of anyone in the area. Certainly a stable  just and durable peace agreement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to be the objective of the United States. But this  we believe  cannot be achieved without the beginning of a genuine negotiating process between the parties concerned. No settlement imposed from the outside can long endure. Negotiation is not capitulation. Negotiating activity among long-standing antagonists across the world is occurring at present. Why should the Middle East be an exception? When North Korea can talk to South Korea  when East Germans can talk to West Germans  when Indians and Pakistanis can meet in the immediate aftermath of war and prior to the withdrawal of troops  then surely the Middle East should be no exception to the general rule that differences should be reconciled through an active dialog between the parties concerned.58.	Let me hasten to add that we do not hold that the process need necessarily begin through direct negotiations. We understand that other diplomatic avenues exist. Ambassador Jarring remains available to help the parties negotiate the terms of a peace settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967).59.	Another-and in our view the most promising-first step would be proximity talks leading to an interim Suez Canal agreement. What would such an agreement do? It would separate the combatants  restore to Egypt operation of and authority over the Suez Canal  involve some Israeli withdrawal  preserve the cease-fire  and provide momentum for further efforts towards an over-all settlement.60.	It is encouraging that both sides agree that such an interim agreement would be not an end in itself but rather the first step towards an over-all peace settlement. Such a practical test of peace on the ground would be in the interests of both sides  and the United States remains prepared to assist in achieving it  if that would be helpful to the parties. Moreover  an over-all settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must meet the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Governments on both sides as well as of the Palestinian people.61.	In considering some of the great political developments of the past few years  one cannot help but observe as the Brazilian Foreign Minister has just done- that the United Nations has not been directly involved. This fact has often been cited in attacks against it.62.	We are all aware  of course  that the Charter does not intend the United Nations to be the center of all diplomacy. Still  as the Secretary-General puts it temperately in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  . . in the political sphere the Organization's place is . . . uncertain"" [A/8701/Add.l  p. 1]. With that thought most of us would agree.63.	As we look to the future  it is well to keep in mind that it is not so much in institutional reforms-and we are certainly not opposed to such reforms-as in national wills that the solutions to the problems must be sought. The future of this body  the future of the United Nations  depends on national wills  on the ability of nations to work together  accommodating themselves to each other's problems  if you will. Yet to the extent that better work methods and more realistic institutional arrangements will help  we also must bring them about.64.	For example  we believe that for the Security Council to maintain its influence and authority  ways must be found to ensure the representation of States  other than the present permanent members and I am speaking about States whose resources and influence are of major importance in world affairs. The absence of Japan  for example  is notable in a body designed to engage the responsibilities of the world's principal Powers.65.	We believe in greater recourse to fact-finding commissions  to good offices and to quiet preventive diplomacy.66.	We believe that the increase in bloc voting  often without independent regard for the merits of the issue  is leading increasingly to unrealistic results.67.	The discussion of the United Nations weaknesses in dealing with political problems has reached its peak just at a time when its contribution to economic development and scientific and technological co-operation is making great strides.68.	Long before economic development became a major matter of international concern  the United Nations initiated efforts to reduce the economic gap between developed and developing countries. From the start the United States has supported that effort. It is an encouraging fact that during each of the last three years the per capita growth in production has finally achieved a higher rate in the less developed than in the developed world. Still  as the recent World Bank report showed  there are serious problems of income distribution  high rates of infant mortality  low rates of literacy  serious malnutrition and widespread ill health.  The United States intends to continue to devote serious efforts to solving such problems through the improved United Nations Development Program  and through other channels of economic assistance. 69.	United Nations activities related to science and technology are also having an impact.70.	The landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has proposed a world monitoring of levels of pollution in water  air  earth and living beings  measuring levels of specific chemicals  such as hydrocarbons which poison the air of the world's cities. To launch this and other important programs without delay  we urge this Assembly to establish the secretariat and the proposed $100 million fund for the environment.71.	The United Nations can also make a substantial contribution in the fight against drug traffic  particularly heroin traffic. A revised Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs will give the International Narcotics Control Board authority to reduce poppy cultivation and opium production in countries shown to be sources of that traffic. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control is helping States to improve their drug administrations  to train police and customs officials  to develop other means of livelihood for opium farmers  and to prevent and treat drug addiction. As President Nixon said last week  “Every Government which wants to move against narcotics should know that it can count on our country for our wholehearted support and assistance in doing so'.72.	Just last week the Secretary-General announced that 1974 will be the World Population Year and the time  of a major United Nations population conference. It is our hope that the conference will lead to the setting of concrete goals of reduced population growth.73.	The General Assembly at this session will review the progress of its sea-bed Committee? in preparing for a conference on the law of the sea [item 36]. It is important for us to use this opportunity to help make the oceans an example of international co-operation rather than an area of future conflict.74.	Such activities as pollution  narcotics  the sea-bed and population control-most of them connected with new applications of science and technology will increase in importance in the future. We believe that they must acquire a greater focus and priority in the United Nations.75.	I have spoken today about some of the United Nations weaknesses as well as some of its strengths because I believe we must look at this Organization realistically so that we may contribute to its future prospects. In that spirit  the United States will continue to support the United Nations. We remain committed to making it stronger and more effective.76.	During this session the United Nations will have an opportunity and an obligation to take action of vital importance to the international community. The United Nations must deal effectively with criminal acts of international terrorism which have so tragically touched the lives of people everywhere  without warning  without discrimination  without regard for the sanctity of human life. 77.	Twenty-four years ago the United Nations  in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights  affirmed that every human being has the right to 'life  liberty  and the security of person'. Yet what is happening in the world today to that security?78.	In Sweden  90 people boarding an international flight are held hostage and held for ransom by Croatian terrorists.79.	In London an Israeli diplomat is killed by a bomb sent through the mail. In New York colleagues in the United Nations narrowly avert a similar fate.80.	In Cyprus 95 persons of many nationalities narrowly escape death on a Venezuelan plane when a bomb is discovered just in time.81.	In New York shots are fired into the apartment of a member of the Soviet mission where children are playing.82.	In Munich 11 Olympic athletes are kidnapped and murdered in a day of horror witnessed throughout the world.83.	In Czechoslovakia a Czechoslovak pilot is killed and his plane hijacked and diverted to West Germany.84.	In Israel 26 tourists  16 of them American citizens  are slaughtered in an insane attack at an international airport.85.	In this year alone 25 airliners from 13 countries have been successfully hijacked  and 26 other attempts have been frustrated. In this year alone 140 airplane passengers and crew have been killed-140 have been killed-and 97 wounded in acts of terrorism. In five years 27 diplomats from 11 countries have been kidnapped and three assassinated. In New York  Arab and other missions have been threatened with violence.86.	Is there anyone here in this Assembly who has not had the occasion  as he has journeyed by plane from around the globe  to be concerned about his own personal safety? Is there any one of you here who has not wondered what terrorist might strike next  or where he might strike?87.	The issue is not an issue of war-not war between States  not civil war or revolutionary war. The issue is not the strivings of people to achieve self-determination and independence. Rather  it is whether millions of air travelers can continue to fly in safety each year. It is whether a person who opens his mail can open it without fear of being blown up. It is whether diplomats can safely carry out their duties. It is whether international meetings  like the Olympics  like this General Assembly  can proceed without the ever-present threat of violence. In short  the issue is whether the vulnerable lines of international communications the airways and the mails  diplomatic discourse and international meetings can continue  without occupation  to bring nations and peoples together. All who have a stake in this have a stake in decisive action to suppress these demented acts of terrorism.88.	We are all aware that  aside from the psychotic and the purely felonious  many criminal acts of terrorism derive from political origins. We all recognize that issues such as self-determination must continue to be addressed seriously by the international community. But political passion  however deeply held  cannot be a justification for criminal violence against innocent persons. Certainly the terrorist acts I have cited are totally unacceptable attacks against the very fabric of international order. They must be universally condemned  whether we consider the cause the terrorists invoke noble or ignoble  legitimate or illegitimate.89.	We must take effective steps to prevent the hijacking of international civil aircraft.90.	We must take effective steps to prevent murderous attacks and the kidnapping of diplomats.91.	We must take effective steps to prevent terrorists from sending bombs through the mails  or murdering innocent civilians. Just a few hours ago  I am pleased to note  the International Criminal Police Organization [INTERPOL]  by a vote of 58 to none  condemned such acts and decided to gear up its machinery to help cope with this very difficult problem.92.	The United States welcomes the initiative the Secretary-General has taken to place this matter on the agenda [A/8791 and Add.l]. Two years ago  before the problem had reached its present dimensions  the General Assembly took the first step  the step that must guide us now. In the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)  annex]  which so strongly-keep this in mind reaffirmed the right of self-determination  the General Assembly also unanimously declared that each nation has a duty to refrain from assisting or in any way participating in""... terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts...""93.	The time has come to make that obligation  which this General Assembly solemnly undertook  more specific and more meaningful. In the past two years the international community has taken certain steps in the field of hijacking. Conventions have been concluded prescribing severe penalties for the hijacking and sabotage of aircraft and requiring States to extradite or prosecute hijackers and saboteurs. We urge all States which have not ratified these conventions to do so.94.	We are now faced with an urgent need to deter and punish international crimes of violence not only in the air but throughout our societies. The United States urges this Assembly to act  and act at once  to meet this challenge.95.	First  the draft treaty to prosecute or extradite those who attack or kidnap diplomats or officials of foreign governments or international organizations should be completed and opened for signature at this session of the Assembly. The draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons are already before the Assembly in the report of the International Law Commission [A/8710/Rev.l  chap. II  sect. C]. 96.	Second  a treaty providing for suspension of all air service to countries which fail to punish or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft should be promptly completed and opened for signature. We repeat that such a treaty should provide for the suspension of all air service to countries which fail to prosecute or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft. It is our view that a nation which provides a safe haven for hijackers should be outlawed by the international community. A draft of a treaty to do this has already been considered by a sub-committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization. To achieve early action  the process of deliberation should be accelerated and a diplomatic conference to complete the treaty should be called without delay.97.	Third  a new treaty on the export of international terrorism should be concluded and opened for signature as soon as possible. It should include universal condemnation of  and require the prosecution or extradition of  persons who kill  seriously injure or kidnap innocent civilians in a foreign State for the purpose of harming or forcing concessions from a State or from an international organization. To complete such a treaty  we believe a diplomatic conference should be convened as soon as possible. The United States Government is today circulating the first draft of such a treaty.  We urge all governments to give it their earnest consideration. We refer to this as a first draft  because we are sure that many suggestions for changes will be made. We are perfectly flexible on the form of the treaty  but we think this is a subject that deserves our earnest attention.98.	We have also embodied these various proposals in a draft resolution which we submitted to the Secretariat this morning for distribution. 99.	These actions would mark a major advance in the struggle against international terrorism. Surely  it is in the collective interest of every nation represented in this hall to arrest the growing assault on international order with which we are all faced. Let this General Assembly be the driving force for the specific and vigorous steps that are required. Let it prove that the United Nations can meet this test. Let it show people everywhere that this Organization  here  now  is capable of the concrete action necessary to bring us closer to a world free of violence-the kind of world which is the great goal of the United Nations Charter."
"120",7340,"VEN",27,1972,"Mr. President  on behalf of my Government  I wish to express to you my sincere congratulations upon your election. It is a well-deserved tribute to your country  a land of age-old culture that has always been present at the crossroads of history  and  above all  a country that has always been a cradle of heroic men. It is  moreover  a proper recognition of your great merits as a highly capable and dedicated public figure.108.	May we on this occasion pay a cordial tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  who had the honor to preside over the General Assembly at the last session.109.	We could not at this time fail to remember our unforgettable friend UThant  or to pay him our most heartfelt tribute for his untiring and distinguished endeavors. His outstanding qualities have left an indelible impression on the minds of all those of us who were privileged to know him  and the pleasant memory of his kind personality.110.	I should like especially to offer our warmest congratulations to our present Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His distinguished career as an enlightened and dedicated man  committed to the loftiest ideals  undoubtedly ensure a promising future for the United Nations.111.	In this general debate we shall refrain from giving our detailed position on the specific items in the agenda. My delegation will put forward the views of my Government in the relevant debates.112.	Never have men felt so close to one another as today. Many factors have contributed to this phenomenon: distance is no longer the obstacle it once was; we have the means to travel with incredible speed from one part of the earth to another. The revolution in transport has been followed by a revolution in the means of social communication. Thus  in our time  it is possible for men to contact each other at any point or in any region of the world  almost immediately.113.	The impressive growth of the world's population has become a further element of change. Because of the population explosion or to be more precise the demographic revolution the earth is becoming increasingly smaller for an ever-larger population. With the ever-faster migration from the rural to the urban areas  we witness the emergence of metropolis and megalopolis  gigantic cities whose inhabitants live in overcrowded conditions.114.	Man's landing on the moon has enabled us to reach a new dimension: that of space. Our earth is almost beginning to look like an enormous spaceship. As we stated last year in this Assembly:""Thus there emerges a new concept: that of mankind. We think of mankind as all the peoples of the world and  thus conceived  mankind appears to us as a world-wide society which encompasses us all and which is in opposition to individual societies or States  having their own lives  it is true  but dependent on the development of that greater society."" [1944th meeting  para. 8.]115.	At the same time  the technological revolution  with the profound changes it has introduced in all the material instruments of human life  has generated a growing process of mass phenomena. This is a continuing social process of progressive depersonalization. The human person-man  as a being endowed with reason and liberty is replaced by mass man. In that mass man  primitive reactions prevail over rational life. He becomes the easy victim of manipulation processes; that is to say  he is at the mercy of those who know how to handle the media of social communication and the techniques of psychology so as to influence man's fundamental attitudes.116.	The consequences of these mass phenomena are far-reaching and deep-seated. Man dehumanized  one of the mass  has abdicated his fundamental condition as a human being  namely  the predominance of reason. Critical judgment has been replaced by emotional reaction  rational life by emotional life.117.	Thus it is that dehumanized man can easily become the plaything of the most diverse pressure groups. He has become fertile soil for the emergence of every kind of hatred and rancor  for all sorts of sectarian positions  however inconceivable  and for every kind of act  however brutal. Finally  this depersonalized  mass man  is capable of any sacrifice for the sake of myths imposed on him and to which he clings emotionally of every kind of violence  unable as he is to grasp the full significance of his acts.118.	Paradoxically and just as man is beginning to feel the unity and solidarity of mankind  just as he is feeling closer than ever to all men  we witness what would appear to be the collapse of all the values on which his conduct and behavior were based. This phenomenon affects the whole of mankind  and there is no country on earth where all the principles that have governed man's  life hitherto are not questioned. There is thus born an attitude of rebellion against every rule and of challenge to all authority.119.	Within that society of the masses  a very important role is played by all the public opinion manipulation procedures  for  through them  it is possible to distort reality to the extent of leaving man as if he were suspended in a vacuum. In point of fact  truth is intermingled with error to the extent that it is not possible to discern where the truth is. On the other hand  error is clothed as truth to the point that it is no longer possible to discover where the error lies. Such a situation engenders a reversal of values and the most serious mental confusion  creating a fertile ground for the proliferation of every kind of extremism and sectarianism.120.	Viewed from this angle  the world today appears to be compressed between two opposite movements: one  which accumulates motives for division and violence  the other which reveals the possibility of a unity which  for the first time  is truly expanding to embrace the whole of the human race.121.	Indeed  on the one hand  never as in our time have more efforts been deployed to achieve solidarity and understanding among men and peoples. The strongest proof of this fact is the constant increase in the large number of international organizations and activities oriented to serve mankind.122.	Yet  on the other hand  never before  perhaps  has the world been so submerged in an atmosphere of violence as it is today. But at this point it becomes necessary to define our terms. In this connexion  in my intervention before this Assembly at the twenty-fifth session I stated that:• ""In ordinary language violence is often confused with force. But this is an error. Force is the body of all means and procedures"" of every kind: physical  psychological  economic  and so on"" used by law for the enforcement of law. On the other hand  violence signifies the illegal use of force meaning the indiscriminate use of force not in accordance with pre-established principles."" [1841st meeting  para. 108. ]123.	The new development in the contemporary world is the deification of violence. It is paid almost religious reverence. We are faced with an existentialist attitude and  consequently  with a new set of values. The ends make the means good. A violent act becomes good if it permits the achievement of the objectives pursued. The followers of the new religion of violence maintain and proclaim that they will stop at no crime to put an end to injustice. They forget that if an unjust act and because unjust therefore violent is answered with a violent act-and because violent therefore unjust we shall have changed nothing on earth since qualitatively we shall be on exactly the same plane of injustice.124.	It is a complex social reality  an effect with multiple causes and the cause of multiple effects. It involves many diverse dynamic factors. Let us analyze briefly the most conspicuous ones.125.	A very small number of States the so-called developed States control the greater part of the wealth and the scientific and technological knowledge of the world. On the other hand  the nations of the developing world see that with each year that passes the existing imbalance between them and the industrialized countries grows wider.126.	Profound social and economic differences wealth and near-poverty  opulence and misery  a vast number of inadmissible contrasts in a human society separate the various national groups within States  particularly in the developing countries.127.	At the international level  the centers of power and decision are concentrated in a few nations. Whether in the balance of blocs or through multi-polarization  various methods of subjection are erected to the benefit of the great Powers.128.	Quite often the financing of development gives rise to situations of economic and political subjection which moreover and not infrequently strengthen the unfair structures of the developing countries. A European Minister in this connexion commented  in rather malicious terms: ""Assistance for development is what the poor people in the rich countries give the rich people in the poor countries"".129.	The desire of States for power and their ambition to dominate engenders the various forms of economic and ideological imperialism. On the other hand  situations of oppression and tyranny at the national and international levels are proliferating.130.	New ideological trends are assuming radical positions and acquire messianic and  to a certain extent  apocalyptic features. Fanatically determined to destroy the existing structures by any means  they resort to systematized violence in order to compound their psychological effect through terror. Thus  systems of permanent subversion are created; conflicts of every kind become more acute  and the most refined means of psychological action are used to submit the will.131.	There is an atmosphere of ethical pollution that is gradually extending to all nations. This process is facilitated by the disintegration of the values by which mankind has so far lived. As a result  several phenomena of social disorder emerge  such as an alarming increase in drug traffic  an increase in crime and the release of primary instincts  phenomena which in turn become polluting agents.132.	The progress achieved in the means of social communication also contributes to the climate of violence. The ""cultural patterns"" they impose surreptitiously through their productions not infrequently contain an exaltation of the violent and therefore of violence. Similarly  the technological advances made in the means of social communication  place at the disposal of States possessing them a hitherto unknown power of cultural control over other States. Today  a nation may well lose its personality as the victim of a cultural invasion which has all the appearances of being a peaceful act but which is none the less fraught with psychological murders.133.	On the other hand  morally speaking  technological progress per se is neither good nor bad. It all depends on the use men make of it. For that reason  technological progress can and in fact does provide its refinements to the various manifestations of violence.134.	The crisis in religious values also has an unfavorable effect  especially in those countries whose religions actively advocate love of one's neighbor and solidarity among men. The eclipse of such values  though momentary  has a negative effect as the appeal to the ever-implicit ethical elevation of man is obscured.135.	Racial discrimination is still  in today's world  an uninterrupted source of violent conflicts. Man's rejection of man for reasons of race gives rise to unending hatred  often aggravated by various other factors that are intermixed with it.136.	This brief analysis we have outlined shows the complexity of the phenomenon of violence. One of its specific manifestations-perhaps the one that has the greatest impact is terrorism. Terrorism is one of the items on the agenda of the current session. I therefore wish to refer to it specifically.137.	For all the aforesaid reasons  I believe that terrorism cannot be considered in isolation; rather it must be considered within the overall context in which it is engendered. It is that context that we have endeavored to summarize.138.	We understand the desire to submit terrorist activities having international repercussions to juridical regulation of universal character. However  while placing ourselves in the field of law  we cannot lose sight of the principles that should inspire any juridical regulation.139.	In our statement at the third special session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States on 26 January 1971  we said in this connexion that law arose to encompass the life from which it proceeded and moved between the desirable and the feasible. We said in simple terms like a great Belgian jurist  Professor Jean Dabin  that on the legal plane not everything that was desirable was feasible and conversely not everything that was feasible was desirable and that it was in the balance between the desirable and the feasible that the optimum juridical norm could be located. We then added that it was therefore obvious that terrorism  because it was a complex phenomenon which was still undefined  could not be regulated in its entirety other than to the extent that clear social situations were being established to which clear-cut laws could be applied.140.	Positive law is oriented towards the attainment of the common good  inspired in an ideal of justice  within the limits established by juridical security. In other words  juridical regulations  from the point of view of the technique of law  are limited by the principle of juridical security. This is the basis for the Roman aphorism  ""summum jus  summa injuria"". Consequently  any juridical regulation which seeks to embody sanctions against acts of violence having international repercussions cannot disregard these fundamental ideas. Thus  for example  there is in the Latin American countries a very wide traditional concept of the right of asylum. In any possible regulation the true and real humanitarian character of this institution must be safeguarded.141.	On the other hand  every juridical norm must tend  by its very nature  towards its effective implementation. From the standpoint of the law and its purposes  it would be a contradiction in terms to dictate a juridical norm and not to apply it. At the international level this presupposes  moreover  the possibility of ratification by the largest possible number of States  especially in the case of the regulation of an act having multiple international repercussions.142.	For all these reasons we believe  justifiably  that in any attempt to regulate acts of violence having international repercussions  prudence which does not exclude firmness must be exercised. We must  in like manner  proceed gradually that is to say  step by step  as results are obtained. Furthermore  the greatest possible number of national approvals should be sought  in order to make the provisions as effective as possible. That is why it is necessary to identify acts with great accuracy and to regulate those that command the consent of the largest number of nations which believe in the eminent dignity of the human person. Consequently  the most appropriate thing to do would be to address ourselves to fundamental situations: those most relevant to the universal common good  the ultimate objective of international law. To proceed otherwise would be to risk a regulation that would be impossible to apply adequately  through lack of universal ratification.143.	The principles that should guide the struggle against violence and its various manifestations are the defence of the eminent dignity of the human person and the safeguarding of justice in international relations. In other words  the struggle against violence is aimed at ensuring man's dignity and safeguarding a just system of international relations. It is for this reason that all we have said does not  of course  preclude the right of peoples to rebel against tyranny  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism or any other form of oppression. Indeed  in this case  it is the oppressors who practice violence; and the right to rebellion  legitimately exercised  represents the effort of the people to restore the infringed juridical order.144.	All this is perfectly logical  since the different forms of oppression are attempts directed against the eminent dignity of the human person and  by disregarding it  are lacking in legality. Therefore  it is essential that at the same time that we proclaim the legitimate right of peoples to fight against the different forms of violence we should proclaim the right of peoples to rebel against the different forms of oppression. We are not trying by this means to allow the very violence we wish to combat. Indeed  the exercise of the legitimate right of peoples to rebel against the different forms of oppression is embodied within very specific ethical and political principles. We shall enumerate them briefly.145.	It is necessary for the prevailing system to be unjust as a whole that is to say  as a system.146.	All lawful means of combating the unjust order must have been exhausted. It is not  therefore  a question of irresponsibly exercising the right of recourse to force against the unjust order. Great harm will ensue as a result of that struggle. In other words  it is necessary that the system  by its very injustice  leaves no other alternative but force.147.	The system to be instituted must be more just than the one that is combated  which presupposes that to destroy the existing one without preparing the regime that is to follow would not be admissible. Moreover  it is the justice of the system to be instituted that  among other reasons  makes legitimate the right to institute it.148.	Definite prospects of success are required  so as not to subject the people to greater evils than those that are being fought.149.	Ultimately  we cannot resort to any means indiscriminately. These  too  are subject to ethical norms. For instance  innocent persons  quite removed from the drama surrounding them  could not be attacked  and any kind of violence against the different means used by man to bring together the peoples of the world would be inadmissible.150.	The principles we have just enunciated are based on the thinking of great philosophers and are still valid today. We believe that we should not forget them; that we should take them into account  in order that  in attempting to fight violence we should not fall into a serious error which could be used as a pretext by tyrannical regimes to maintain the unjust order.151.	Having made this reservation  we condemn terrorism in all its forms because we condemn recourse to violence. The latter carries within it its own lethal dialectics: one act of violence is followed by another in a dynamic crescendo of recourse to violence.152.	In man's every thought and heart-beat there is always a direct relationship between the positive-evolutionary forces and the instinctive-regressive violence. That dangerous relationship makes it possible to assess the risks and the advantages. And there will always be more risks than advantages  because hatred and violence spring from animal instinct  whereas understanding and friendship are created and recreated in the heart guided by reason.153.	We reject as anti-human the postulate of inevitable violence  since its blind outbreak implies the very surrender of the human condition. But at the same time  we affirm that neither classical pacifism nor the dialectics of atomic horror  nor a Utopian international ideology will either singly or jointly suffice to solve the crucial problem of the violence and exasperation of the present-day world. Ideological hatred  generator of mistrust  misunderstanding and fanaticism  continues to be the major factor responsible for violence.154.	But violence is not exercised exclusively through action. Omission and negligence in the face of a state of violence may be equally compromising. The spirit guilty of routine and the status quo of inertia and immobility in the face of conflicts and divergences are the direct cause of the irrational paroxysm of violence. Thus  before the final judgment of history and mankind  those responsible for omission or surrender of the necessary political will are as guilty as the irrational agents of violence themselves.155.	The struggle against violence is  therefore  not only a juridical but a political  economic  social  cultural  ethical and religious fact as well. It is a task devolving on us all. It entails individual and collective  national and international action. It likewise entails the institution of a new international order in which relations among peoples lead towards the attainment of the universal common good inspired in international social justice. Indeed  in the final analysis  the struggle against violence is the building of peace itself."
"121",7488,"YEM",27,1972,"Mr. President  permit me to express to you on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic  and on my own behalf  our whole-hearted satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are certain that your election to that high office reflects the confidence of the General Assembly in your personal qualities and the high esteem in which it holds the Polish People's Republic  which is bound to my country by friendly relations.2.	I wish  Mr. President  to express my delegation's appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Adam Malik  the Foreign Minister of Indonesia  for the brilliant role he played in presiding over the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.3.	I wish also  with great satisfaction and pleasure  to convey on behalf of my Government and delegation-sincere congratulations to Mr. Kurt Waldheim on his election to the high office of Secretary-General and to wish him success in the arduous tasks of that distinguished post.4.	The restoration to the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights in the United Nations is in our view an important event and a turning-point in the history of this Organization in its march towards a brighter future. My delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at this important step taken at the last session of the General Assembly. My country considers the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations a victory for the third world and for the United Nations itself.5.	The twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held in circumstances which require our closest attention and consideration. It is witnessing a series of events which demand our thorough study and require deeper understanding of their dimensions.6.	On the one hand  we are witnessing in the third world an overwhelming revolution against exploitation  injustice and official terrorism. We see that the peoples of the countries of the third world have chosen the road of violent struggle in order to regain their legitimate rights because of the inability of the United Nations to bring them justice and because of the failure of international law-which seems to have been made to safeguard the status quo to protect them and their legitimate"" rights.7.	On the other hand  we are witnessing a rapprochement between East and West  and we note that the tension which dominated Europe is being dissipated and replaced by a new phenomenon characterized by detente and common interests. Although my Government and my country welcome that phenomenon  which undoubtedly encourages us to be optimistic about the future of peace  in Europe in particular  and about relations between the two traditional camps in general  it should be viewed in a much wider context  because peace is one and indivisible. Consequently  any rapprochement or detente between East and West will not be fruitful unless it is extended to the other parts of the world.8.	Furthermore  peace cannot be real and effective so long as the industrialized countries and the developing countries are separated by a wide gap  which is becoming even wider every year. The United Nations will not achieve success in its march towards peace and progress unless the industrialized countries adopt a policy of sincere co-operation with the United Nations in its efforts to put an end to exploitation afflicting the developing countries.9.	We cannot but view with concern the Second United Nations Development Decade declared by the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session in 1970 [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  for the experiences and unsatisfactory results of the first Development Decade are still fresh in our minds. In our opinion  the proper organs of the United Nations should locate those areas of weakness that led to the failure of the first Development Decade. At the same time  we reaffirm our demand for co-operation by the industrialized countries with United Nations efforts to achieve the objectives of the Second Development Decade.10.	We recognize that the responsibility for development rests primarily with the developing countries. The industrialized countries  however  should in our view assume a part of that responsibility. They are duty-bound to provide technical advice and assistance and to participate with all seriousness  sincerity and objectivity in United Nations programs in the developing countries.11.	The Yemen Arab Republic  which is one of 25 countries identified by the United Nations Committee for Development Planning as the ""hard core"" among the developing countries  is now determined to mobilize all its human and material resources and potential to face the challenge represented by the responsibility of economic development. We believe that through co-operation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as well as through bilateral agreements  we shall be able to overcome the problems of development in particular  poverty and unemployment.12.	General Assembly resolution 2768 (XXVI) was the outcome of many studies and reports. We think that the proper organs-in particular  the Office of the UnderSecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and the United Nations Development Program should direct their efforts to translate into action the existing proposals and suggested solutions. Moreover  we think that the United Nations should carefully adopt a development program for the developing countries based on the guidelines suggested by previous reports and studies regarding the under-developed countries  as is the case of the United Nations Volunteers program  which in its initial stage has proved effective and successful. The industrialized countries should also be called upon to give their financial assistance and technical know-how to make that pro-gramme more useful and effective.13.	The third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in Santiago  Chile  early this year  was important to the developing countries  especially in view of the international monetary crisis facing the world  and its implications. The session highlighted the need for the developing countries to take collective action in order to protect their interests. Some industrialized Powers have attempted to solve the monetary problem by placing restrictions on their trade with the developing countries in order to maintain their exploitation and domination  and have tried to shift the burden of the problem to the small countries.14.	The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held in Stockholm in June of this year  was an attempt to overcome the problem of pollution. If nothing else  that Conference was an expression of the increasing awareness of the danger of pollution and has put responsibility for this problem at the doorstep of the industrialized countries.15.	The delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic supports the resolutions adopted by the two aforementioned conferences in Santiago and Stockholm and calls on all countries to co-operate with the United Nations in the implementation of those resolutions and recommendations. We also request the United Nations  together with the industrialized countries  to respond to the appeals made by the Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries held in Georgetown  Guyana in August  regarding the right of developing countries to full sovereignty over their natural resources in order to consolidate their economic and political independence.16.	If the Yemen Arab Republic attaches great importance to the United Nations in the field of development  it attaches even greater importance to the role of this Organization as an instrument of peace  justice and progress. We consider the Charter to be a program of clear principles and objectives. Hence  Yemen's.support for the United Nations and the principles enshrined in the Charter is a result of the Yemeni people's belief in those principles and objectives and their deep conviction that the United Nations will remain the only way to spare the world and succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Therefore  our people believes that it is a sacred duty of all Members of this Organization to uphold and strengthen the United Nations and to respect its Charter.17.	If and when a very few States  in violation of their obligations under the Charter  persist in defying and ignoring United Nations principles  the entire membership of the Organization is called upon to raise its voice and declare its condemnation.18.	There are many problems requiring speedy and decisive action by the United Nations. They are the problems of colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid  racial discrimination in Africa  and the continuing wars of aggression in the Middle East and VietNam. The delegation of Yemen wishes to present its views regarding these problems  which threaten international peace and security and are of great concern to world public opinion. As we discuss these problems  we deem it necessary to reiterate our total support for the resolutions of the United Nations in fulfillment of our obligations under the Charter and in expression of our concern to uphold the United Nations and the principles it represents.19.	It is our sacred duty to affirm again the need to restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate rights in conformity with international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter. The people of Palestine have been expelled from their homeland and have been deprived of their possessions and property. The people of Palestine are now dispersed throughout the world  or are living in tents on the charitable contributions provided through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The expulsion and murder of the Palestinian people at the hands of the neo-Nazis in Palestine are unparalleled in human history. Indeed  they dwarf the crimes perpetrated by the German Nazis in the first half of this century.20.	Events and developments now taking place in the Middle East confirm beyond any doubt that world Zionism  represented by the ruling clique of Tel Aviv  rejects any peace based on right and justice and refuses to respond to repeated appeals of the United Nations concerning the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and repatriation. World Zionism also refuses to withdraw from the territories of Egypt  Syria and Jordan it has occupied by force and war following the treacherous aggression against those Arab countries in June 1967.21.	We believe in peace  but we also believe that the only way to achieve it is to remove all conditions of injustice to which the Palestinian people have been subjected. Therefore we maintain that any solution of this problem will not be successful unless it expressly provides for the complete recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the provisions of the Charter  the principles of international law and the practice of civilized societies. The Yemen delegation warns against any minimization of the rights of the Palestinian people  for this would only result in the escalation of the state of tension and chaos in the region  which would inevitably lead to a large-scale confrontation.22.	If the Zionists believe that the policy of violence and terror they practice against the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general is the only way of coexistence  then they should be made to realize that they are gambling with their own existence and exposing the world to unnecessary war.23.	As long as the Zionists continue to ignore the United Nations resolutions  the Charter and principles of human rights  as long as they continue their aggression against the Arab countries  as long as they continue to deny the Palestinian people their legitimate rights to their homes and self-determination  peace will never come to the Middle East.24.	My delegation maintains and even warns this Assembly that Israel alone is responsible for the deterioration of the situation because of its continued aggression against Arab countries  its repeated attacks against Lebanese and Syrian territories and its continued acts of terrorism and murder.25.	Another problem disturbing the human conscience and threatening peace and security is the war of aggression in Viet-Nam and all IndoChina. Our delegation declares its total support for the struggle carried out by the heroic VietNamese people to free their country from foreign forces and calls upon the United Nations to take a firm stand with regard to this problem. The Government of Yemen is convinced that the only way to reach a just and reasonable solution of this thorny problem is the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Viet-Nam  thus allowing the Vietnamese to exercise their right to self-determination in full freedom and in a manner of their own choice  without any outside interference or external pres-sure. Therefore our delegation demands the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from South Viet-Nam and calls upon the States concerned to respect the fight of the Vietnamese people to self-determination.26.	My delegation and my Government express their satisfaction with the recent developments in the Korean peninsula. We welcome the dialog which has been conducted between the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of South Korea. We also welcome the steps taken by the Red Cross societies in the two parts of Korea.27.	It is our conviction that the General Assembly should have taken up the Korean problem at this session and discussed it in the light of these new developments in the peninsula. In our opinion  the least the General Assembly should have done at this juncture was to adopt a resolution endorsing the positive steps taken thus far  calling for more efforts and declaring the removal of the United Nations flag  which is still at this moment flying over the helmets of the foreign occupying forces in South Korea.28.	We wish to reiterate here that the reunification of Korea is the responsibility solely of the Korean people  who must be given the freedom to decide their own destiny. This  we believe  cannot be accomplished unless the foreign occupation forces in South Korea are withdrawn. The existence of those troops constitutes the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of the country and the prevalence of brotherhood and understanding between the two countries.29.	The position of the Government of the Yemen Arab Republic with regard to the issue of colonialism is well known. We wish to confirm again our support of the National Liberation Movements in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) under the leadership of FRELIMO. We call upon the United Nations to take a firm stand vis-a-vis the Government of Lisbon with regard to its continued flouting of United .Nations resolutions and its defiance of world opinion represented by this Organization. We realize that Portugal alone could not continue its colonial war against the nationalists in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). It is with the material and military assistance offered by some States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Portugal has been able to defy the United Nations and continue its criminal war against the African nationalists in those areas.30.	When we discuss colonialism and its crimes we are forced to discuss racial discrimination and apartheid practiced by the Government of the white minority of South Africa against the people of Namibia. Our Organization has already adopted several resolutions regarding the colonial situation in Namibia  the most important being the resolution  adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-first session in 1966  which terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia [resolution 2145 (XXI)]. The racist Government in Pretoria does not recognize the competence of the United Nations and therefore refuses to implement the resolutions regarding Namibia. We cannot accept that attitude. Our loyalty to the principles of the United Nations and its Charter and our strong desire to strengthen the position of this Organization compel us to demand the imposition of sanctions against South Africa in accordance with Articles 6 41 and 42 of the Charter.31.	The list is still incomplete  for there is still the problem of the people of Zimbabwe  who live under the racial terror and the rule of the white minority in Southern Rhodesia. In November 1965  that transplanted racist minority declared unilateral independence. But what is the significance of that independence to the African nationals  who represent the majority of the population of Rhodesia? It means the continuation of colonialism and the loathsome exploitation of the material and human resources of that country for the benefit of a foreign racist group.32.	What is happening in Southern Rhodesia resembles and parallels what is taking place in occupied Palestine.British colonialism is alone responsible for the crimes being perpetrated now in both Palestine and Rhodesia. Britain withdrew from Palestine  which was under its Mandate  and left it prey to a foreign racist clique. The same barbaric operation has been repeated in Rhodesia  where Britain has refused since 1947 to submit information on that Territory to the United Nations  insisting that Rhodesia does not fall within the scope of Chapter XI of the Charter. Moreover  it has given the white racist minority in that area the freedom to control and exploit the resources of the Zimbabwe people and to repress their right to independence and freedom. The mutilation and violation of the most elementary principles and laws that is being witnessed by humanity are but one aspect of colonialism  whose crimes would make the devil appear to be a saint.33.	We demand the overthrow of the illegal and racist regime of Ian Smith and we support the struggle of the Zimbabwe people for freedom and independence. We support all liberation movements which aim at establishing a national rule supported by the majority of the people.34.	Yemen  a small country whose people have struggled throughout history and have made innumerable sacrifices in order to preserve their freedom and independence and their right to self-determination  well knows the meaning of struggle and the high price it exacts. Therefore it has deep compassion for those who are still deprived of their basic human rights. We call on the United Nations and all freedom and peace-loving nations to come to the assistance of these struggling peoples and to extend to them all possible aid  for humanity will never be free as long as there is one single human being enslaved  and there will be no peace on earth as long as there is one single people  however small or weak  deprived of its right to self-determination in its homeland.35.	The voices of condemnation which we began to hear against the freedom fighters  some of which were pronounced from this rostrum in an attempt to equate struggle with terrorism  were neither new nor strange to the history of struggle. The same charges were leveled against the comrades of Cromwell and Washington  against the comrades of the Paris communes  against the comrades of Simon Bolivar and Garibaldi  against the heroes of the French resistance  against the comrades of Lenin and Mao Tse-tung  against the freedom fighters in Algeria and all Africa  and against the many  many others in the long list of heroes throughout the history of human struggle for freedom. That did not discourage the freedom fighters nor dissuade them from their march along the arduous path to freedom. As we go through the last third of this century  it is our duty to stand beside those fighters and help them regain their legitimate rights. It is the duty of the United Nations to play an essential role in this respect.36.	Terrorists are those who blow up houses over the heads of their inhabitants as the Zionist State does in occupied Palestine. Terrorists are those who suppress the freedom of man in Namibia  Mozambique  Angola  Guinea (Bissau) and Rhodesia.37.	Some States have officially practiced and continue to practice terrorism and violence against innocent people. The indiscriminate bombing in IndoChina  the crimes committed by the authorities of Salisbury  Pretoria and Lisbon against the African nationals represent the worst of terrorism and enrage the human conscience. The Zionist State in Palestine was established by terrorism and continues to live by terrorism. The crimes perpetrated by the Zionists against the Palestinian and neighboring Arabs  day after day and year after year  make the Zionists the indisputable masters of terrorism.38.	If the United Nations is to take upon itself the responsibility for addressing itself to the problem of terrorism  it must start by identifying and eliminating the sources of terrorism: the practices of imperialists  colonialists and the transplanted racist minorities directed against the peoples of the third world in Africa  Asia and Latin America.39.	The responsibility of the United Nations is enormous and the Organization should assert its moral and political authority. Believing  as we do  in the United Nations  we implore that it keep in tune with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world for freedom  justice and progress. We believe that the Member States  and especially the big Powers  are responsible for protecting peace and upholding the authority of the United Nations as an instrument of freedom  peace  justice and progress. Unless Member States co-operate in fulfillment of their obligations under the Charter  the future of this Organization is in danger.40.	We believe in the United Nations and its principles. We believe that it is the only instrument able to promote peace  freedom and progress in this world. We believe that it is the true expression of peoples' hopes and aspirations everywhere. Yemen  as a developing nation and as part of the third world  has a vested interest in a strong and effective United Nations. We will continue to uphold the principles of the Charter and give all our support to its endeavor to translate these principles into living realities."
"122",7535,"YUG",27,1972,"Mr. President  in congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of our Assembly  I wish first of all to emphasize the confidence which the Yugoslav delegation places in your outstanding abilities  from which I am certain our session will greatly benefit. In your person I also greet a representative of socialist Poland  a country to which the people of Yugoslavia is linked by ties of deep-rooted friendship and co-operation in all fields.101.	It gives me great pleasure likewise to associate myself with all those who have expressed their appreciation for the wise way in which the Foreign Minister of the friendly State of Indonesia presided over the work of the twenty- sixth session of our Assembly.102.	I wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to express to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  at this first session of the General Assembly which he is attending in his capacity as Secretary-General  our appreciation for the active and notable initiatives he is undertaking.103.	It is an undeniable fact that the past year has been exceptionally rich in events and in changes. The immediate future will best show  after all that has occurred  whether the world has good reason to feel more at ease and more secure today  or whether its contradictions have merely been somewhat attenuated.104.	The United Nations has played a great role in preparing and in promoting the current process of negotiation and detente. But it is equally true that a great many events have taken place outside the United Nations and without its participation. Bilateralism in relations among the great Powers can never conflict with the role of the United Nations  with one proviso  and that is that every-thing achieved by the great Powers in their mutual relations contributes toward the creation of better conditions for the effective solution of the fundamental contradictions of our times. In a world characterized by general interdependence  relations among great Powers affect all international relations to such a degree that even their mutual relations can no longer be regarded as their exclusive business. We have no doubts as to what has already been achieved on the bilateral level  but it is our feeling that the international community as a whole must necessarily be the architect of the peace  the progress and the co-operation to which we all aspire and the ensuing responsibilities and obligations are incumbent upon all of us.105.	In short  we wonder more and more about the nature of the relaxation of tensions  about the negotiations and the detente that are now emerging. What benefits will the smaller and poorer countries derive from the determination of the great and developed countries to avoid conflict among themselves and to normalize their relations?106.	However  developments and tendencies that run counter to detente and the easing of tensions  far from having disappeared  have lost nothing of their fundamental force. Imperialism and other forms of hegemony  of economic inequality and foreign interference  far from being checked  are in fact attempting to impose themselves once more in other forms.107.	Tne world must beware of tarrying too long at a crossroads where  although general confrontation is not an imminent danger  the solution of the most pressing prob-lems is likewise not an immediate prospect.108.	For all these reasons  I feel that I am not wrong in saying that a period of new and increased obligations and responsibilities has begun for the United Nations. The United Nations archives are filled with a huge number of documents and decisions  the validity of which no one can question  but the implementation of which is in no wise guaranteed. The United Nations will experience a rebirth only if  in the present detente  it succeeds in finding widening possibilities for asserting its place and its role. The generally more favorable prospects for peace and security should reinforce the safeguards given to all countries and peoples  assuring them that they can be more at ease with regard to their independence and that they can feel greater confidence concerning the acceleration of their material and cultural progress.109.	The Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  recently held in Georgetown  reflected the needs of the present political moment  aspirations which coincide with the hopes of the greater part of the international community and with the goals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Non-alignment is not an exclusive club  nor is it a sort of collective self-defense. It is a growing political movement which is becoming an ever more influential factor in international relations. At Georgetown too  the non-aligned nations spoke out in favor of a universal detente and for the elimination of pressures exerted by the stronger against the weaker and for the democratization of international relations; they warned against the danger inherent in the monopolization or regional limitation of the process of detente. At that time too  the non-aligned countries energetically demanded the elimination of force and the use thereof  still so frequent and so brutal  and displayed a strong sense of responsibility with regard to the prosperity and destiny of the world as a whole.110.	Coexistence  co-operation and prosperity must be general or they cannot exist at all. It is difficult to build peace but it is easy to disturb it. There will be no coexistence among the great Powers unless a beginning is made towards solution of the major problems of the present-day world.111.	It is for this reason that Yugoslavia  together with the great family of non-aligned countries which at present constitute a majority of our Organization  calls for an immediate halt to the American bombing in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and for a search for a just political solution on the basis of the constructive proposals submitted by the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the seven-point program of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. The most recent declaration of that Government constitutes one more contribution to the search for such a solution. The five-point program of the Government of Prince Sihanouk offers a firm basis for the restoration of peace and freedom to the people of Cambodia also. The war in Indochina must cease. That war is not only a tragedy for the peoples of IndoChina and a financial drain on the people of the United States  but it is also a difficult trial for all of us. As long as it goes on  in whatever form  it will remain a negative factor in any evaluation of the duration and soundness of the detente that we have welcomed with such great hopes.112.	The conduct of Israel meets with less and less understanding. But unfortunately  that conduct continues to be characterized by undiminished aggressiveness  as confirmed again by its recent retaliatory military terrorist acts. All this shows that in actual fact the actions of Israel are not motivated by concern for its own security. For it is quite clear that within its pre-war boundaries  and through peace and co-operation with its neighbors  Israel could obtain the maximum guarantees for its security. These actions are  rather  the fruit of a dangerous ambition to retain territories wrested from the Arabs by force and to deprive the Arab people of Palestine of their legitimate rights forever. The current session of the General Assembly offers a chance to make a decisive effort to overcome the present situation and finally to offer the prospect of an effective solution to the crisis  with Security Council resolution 242(1967) constituting a confirmed and generally accepted basis for such a solution.113.	The divergence between what is spoken aloud and the actual situation with respect to decolonization and apartheid has not been narrowed in any way. Will anything really be done in the new climate in order to overcome resistance to the implementation of the decisions on the liberation of Portuguese colonies  of the Zimbabwe people  of Namibia and of other Territories? Will greater support and assistance be extended to the liberation movements?114.	Unfortunately  the questions that I have asked are not new. And perhaps this already says much. No added weight should be given to doubts that the peace which now exists is too onerous and that the only purpose it serves is to have old aims achieved by new means.115.	My Government shares the concern at the intensification of international terrorism which threatens the lives of innocent persons and jeopardizes normal international relations and co-operation. Yugoslavia  whose citizens and representatives abroad have frequently been victims of threats  violence and terrorist acts  has been warning against such dangers for a number of years. Unfortunately  there was no appropriate response  although it must have been perfectly clear that such activities were directed not only against Yugoslavia and the safety of its citizens  but also against the citizens of countries in which the perpetrators of such acts often enjoy protection and often even direct support.116.	The time has come for the nature and causes of this disquieting phenomenon to be defined  and for co-ordinated action to be taken effectively to combat it. We believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate place for this problem to be dealt with. International co-operation and  above all  the willingness of Governments to fulfill the obligations deriving from international law and the Charter constitute a fundamental prerequisite for such action. The taking of innocent hostages  attacks against the machinery of international relations  and upon the trans-port facilities of countries not involved in military conflicts are all acts that we must condemn and towards whose eradication we must work. It is intolerable that under the pretext of democratic freedoms the defeated Fascist elements should be allowed to organize for the purpose of committing terrorist acts against independent countries.117.	Even less can we allow the word ""terrorism"" to be applied to organized resistance against terror or used as a pretext to obstruct a justified and legitimate struggle which is inevitable when there are relations of subjection  domination and injustice in existence. In opposing terrorism we have always condemned individual acts of terror  convinced that they actually cause more harm to liberation movements by leading them astray and reducing the support they should receive in their just struggle. We would defeat the ends we seek if the condemnation and repression of international terrorism were to benefit those who practice the terrorism of colonization or mass reprisals against entire peoples  since it is this type of action which is the primary source of despair and terrorism against individuals.118.	The improvement of conditions in Europe is a significant and favorable factor in the present world situation. However  this process is being hampered by trends seeking to perpetuate the existing division of the European continent into blocs and to divorce European detente from the world context. The conference on European security and co-operation will prove to be of great significance if it reverses this trend. Europe cannot be an island of peace and detente in a turbulent sea of upheaval and conflict. Therefore  while endeavoring to establish relations that would guarantee to all European countries the right to develop independently irrespective of size  geographic position or socio-political system and the possibility of doing so  Europe must be one component of an identical process throughout the world. Otherwise  sooner or later Europe would suffer the reverberations of conflicts and antagonisms in other parts of the world.119.	The results of the European conference should provide fresh incentives and create new possibilities for co-operation in the Balkans  where European contradictions have always manifested themselves in an intensified form. European detente also implies the recognition of the intimate link between Europe and the Mediterranean  a link which can no longer be denied. One of the initiatives flowing from this relationship has been undertaken by the non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean. This initiative remains open to all nations sharing the same concern and having the same needs.120.	Despite certain initial achievements in the field of disarmament and in spite of bilateral agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States of America  the arms race has not ended. Nothing can diminish the role and the responsibility of the United Nations as the body most directly concerned with disarmament  because solutions affecting all countries in fact the entire world should not be sought or prepared outside the world Organization. For that reason Yugoslavia supports the convening of a world disarmament conference with the equitable participation of all States in all phases of its preparation.121.	The third session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment have clearly shown that there are more important issues of concern to mankind and have shown to what extent the manufacture and use of modern weapons undermine the material and even the biological existence of man.122.	In the field of economic relations the main problems have now been pinpointed and the avenues to their solution clearly defined. Unfortunately  the distance between the definition of a problem and its solution is sometimes very great. The third session of UNCTAD did not achieve the expected results. Solutions must be sought at the broadest international level. I am thinking particularly of the need to reform the world monetary and trade systems. This does not  of course  imply that other outstanding issues have lost their importance-above all the urgent problems relating to access to the markets of developed countries  international financing  shipping  and so on. However  if we attach specific importance to the monetary and trade problems it is because they constitute the touchstone of the capacity of the international community to adopt a new system which should be universal and serve  the interests of all the members of the international community  regardless of differences in levels of economic development and socio-economic systems.123.	Because we believe in the universality of this world Organization  my country  in response to the desire of the Government of Bangladesh  has actively supported its application for membership in the United Nations. We consider it unquestionable that the new independent  sovereign and peaceful State of Bangladesh meets the criteria and fulfills the conditions laid down by the Charter for the admission of new Members. My Government sincerely believes that the admission of Bangladesh to membership in the world Organization at the present session would greatly contribute both to the independence and international status of that State and to the stabilization of international relations in that part of Asia.124.	The democratization of international relations is one of the most important requirements of the contemporary world  and in this regard the United Nations constitutes a lever of vital importance. The effectiveness of the Organization will  to a large extent  depend on how its Member States succeed in co-ordinating our essentially common interests  regardless of how irreconcilable those interests may sometimes appear. Any analysis must inevitably confirm the fact that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter provide even today a sound basis for the solution of the complex set of economic  social  political  humanitarian and other issues of the present-day world.125.	Basically  conflicts between States are the result of a failure to solve social contradictions within the States themselves. Peace is a prerequisite for social progress; but social progress itself is a prerequisite for peace. International conditions should not restrict or impede possibilities for any country's domestic development or national emancipation. There can be no such thing as peace if it is a peace which perpetuates the external obstacles to independent internal progress.126.	The freedom of nations and the freedom of the individual are one and the same aspiration. The demand by man to participate in social progress and the demand of countries to take part in world affairs really merge into one.Yugoslavia believes in this and it is for that reason that we are exerting every effort towards that end.127.	The worth of our Organization will be measured by its ability to assist peoples and nations to progress in peace and freedom towards the goals that they cannot and will not give up."
"123",7573,"ZAF",27,1972,"Mr. President  I am glad to have the opportunity today of extending to you  on behalf of the South African delegation  my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. At the same time  I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Malik of Indonesia  who so successfully guided our deliberations during the twenty- sixth session of the Assembly.2.	May I also pay my respects to our new Secretary-General and wish him every success in the discharge of his heavy responsibilities?3.	Change is inevitable  and nowhere is this more true than in the field of international relations. We contemplate today a world different from the world that existed at the time of the last session of the General Assembly  for the past year has witnessed changes of more than ordinary significance  including the evolution of what may be termed a new relationship among the major Powers. It is true that the legacy of the Second World War  the polarization of the nations of the world into different power blocs  is still with us today more than a quarter of a century later. But recently  important developments have begun to ease at least some of the tensions of the past.4.	These developments have followed a series of initiatives on the part of several of the major Powers  leading  it would seem  to a degree of reconciliation and a lessening of animosity between some of them. We find ourselves in a new situation  and axiomatically a new situation brings with it the prospect of new opportunities. There is  in particular  the promise of better understanding and theft- fore of a more peaceful world.5.	We in South Africa hope that this promise will be realized. We welcome any development which tends to lessen international tension and which leans in the direction of defusing  rather than accentuating  international confrontation-confrontation which in this day and age could lead to catastrophe for the world. We welcome the approach of the major Powers which  after all these years  are moving increasingly  albeit cautiously  from a posture of mutual recrimination towards one of negotiation. We are glad that the negotiations which have already taken place provide support for the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations  large and small.6.	What conclusions are to be drawn by an onlooker from these developments? In the first place  it is striking that  although the internal political and social systems of the major Powers are often widely divergent  this has not deterred them from reaching an accommodation with one another on the issues which have hitherto divided them. None has found it necessary to change its own system or to try to impose such an adjustment on others. It has  in fact  been specifically stated in communiques and conference documentation that essential differences in ideology  social systems and even foreign policies should be no bar to the conduct of relations between States  based on such universal principles as respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  non-aggression against States  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. It was also recognized that international disputes should be settled without resort to the threat or use of force.7.	In the second place we should note that  despite the significance of the recent developments to which I have referred  the progress so far made is unfortunately only marginal in comparison with the awesome magnitude and complexity of the problems that still remain. These problems  which vitally affect not only the larger nations but every nation in the world  include such issues as economic development  the preservation of our global environment  famine and over-population  disarmament  and so on. Any advance in these spheres is encouraging and it is indeed gratifying to acknowledge in passing that a measure of progress has this year been recorded in some of them. It is regrettable  however  that even on such cardinal matters as the environment and economic development  political considerations  for reasons frequently not even remotely relevant to the central issue  are allowed to intrude into the proceedings.A/PV.20468.	How are the smaller nations affected by the new fluidity in international relations? It is clear that the developments in the past year or two involving the major Powers have acted as a catalyst for the reassessment of many existing political situations. No country can wisely disregard them altogether. It seems to me  furthermore  that the smaller Powers now have an incentive to show that they  too  can relax tension among themselves. The lesson is that consultation and negotiation are more rewarding for all the parties concerned than confrontation leading to possible conflict  destruction and suffering; the lesson is that differences in internal social systems are no deterrent to accommodation between the parties; the lesson  furthermore  is that an essential prerequisite to a climate of mutua1 trust and confidence  leading to the settlement of diffe • ences  is acceptance and implementation of the principles of non-aggression  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and peaceful coexistence. It is my hope that the smaller States will heed this lesson  strive for cooperation and thus lay the basis for the progress and advancement of their peoples.9.	In the face of the great problems with which the world as a whole is confronted  and with particular reference to me immense task of development which faces the smaller developing countries  none of us can afford the luxury of international bickering and dispute  which distract our attention from the fundamental problems and detract from our ability to solve them.10.	Let us in this regard briefly consider the record of the year which has just gone by. We find that progress has in fact been erratic. In some areas improvement has been registered; in others  however  an atmosphere of armed hostility survives in the aftermath of a regional war; elsewhere we have witnessed military coups d'etat  assassination attempts  massive loss of life in communal conflicts  hijacking and terrorism in its different manifestations. Only some of these activities have received the attention of this Organization. This is the darker side of the picture  but I mention it because these are activities which gravely undermine international order and progress  and history will harshly judge the international community and this Organization if they continue unchecked. In the economic and social fields progress has also been uneven and the world has had to live through a further period of financial crisis and instability. It is clear that progress will not come easily.11.	Against this background of shifting international attitudes and uneven accomplishment  may I sketch some of the principles governing South Africa's approach to international intercourse. As a starting-point  let me reiterate that we fully subscribe to the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. We shall continue to apply this principle in the conduct of our relations with our neighbors in southern Africa  where the principle has most relevance for us. We have given solemn undertakings in this regard. Our aim is to exist peacefully with each of them to out mutual advantage. We have no aggressive intentions or expansionist ambitions.12.	We believe also in the peaceful settlement of disputes  which is the fundamental message of the Charter  and we reject the use of violence and force as a means to an end. Instead we favor dialog and negotiation  contact and communication. We can point in this regard to our contacts with the Secretary-General on the future of South West Africa. We remain ready to enter into dialog with anyone who reciprocates our genuine interest therein. Let me make it clear once again today that we are prepared to discuss even South Africa's internal policies in the course of such a dialog. My country practices and lives dialog and sees in it a positive approach to world problems and an effective way of promoting peaceful coexistence and world harmony.13.	Accordingly we have on several occasions shown our readiness to seek solutions to current problems within this framework. I am convinced that the development of dialog between South Africa and African nations can lead only to improved relations to the benefit of all. There is already evidence that this is so. I may mention in this regard  for example  the historic state visit of the President- for-life of Malawi to South Africa during 1971  which was followed by an equally successful return visit by the South African State President earlier this year. We believe that reciprocal visits of this nature  conducted at all levels  are important from the point of view of breaking down prejudices and increasing understanding.14.	Then there is the question of internal dialog. It has been asserted in some quarters that South Africa should conduct a dialog with its own people before attempting to engage in a dialog with independent States  particularly those of Africa. This assertion appears to be based  as in the case of so many attitudes towards South Africa  on a fundamental misconception of the situation. There is  in fact  a continuing dialog with the various peoples in South Africa  which has been and is being conducted at all levels  from the lowest to the highest. The self-governing nations emerging in South Africa are producing leaders and representatives who are empowered by their own people to conduct a dialog at the highest level with the South African Government and this they have been doing. Ministers and officials of my Government are in constant touch with ministers and their officials in the homelands  all of which enjoy some form of self-government. Last year the South African Prime Minister himself conferred with leaders of all the different peoples of the Republic  some of which  namely the Xhosas and the Zulus  total as many as 4 million each  and these meetings have continued this year. Moreover  these leaders travel overseas extensively and exchange views and ideas with a wide cross-section of world opinion. What is all this  if it is not dialogue in the truest sense of the word?15.	It is a strange phenomenon that dialogue in any form should be discouraged in this Organization. The Organization  whose raison d'etre is the maintenance of peace in the world  is the largest and most universal forum of the community of nations for the exchange of points of view. Implicit in the concept of the United Nations is that disputes are better settled by words than by force. It is therefore inexplicable and unforgiveable that the membership should actively or even obliquely support in any way programmes of force  violence and terror  while at the same time disavowing dialogue. We hope that all Members will adopt a positive approach to dialogue and that dialogue itself will not become a source of discord among the nations of the world. It would be tragic if it were to be used by some for divisive purposes to split us into opposing groups or blocs.16.	The repudiation of dialogue leads to reliance upon uglier means of settling differences  none more ugly and abhorrent than terrorism. Recent incidents of terrorism have horrified the world. But terrorism is not new. It has existed for years. During the past decade or more  indiscriminate terrorism has spread to virtually every corner of the globe  bringing in its wake suffering  destruction and death. The terrorist outrages committed at Munich and elsewhere have been widely condemned  here and elsewhere. This is very proper  but it is not enough. Terrorism is a universal evil which must be stamped out everywhere. There can be no differentiation between types of terrorism. In all its forms it is a disease which respects no frontier. None that ignores it abroad is immune to it at home.17.	This Organization in particular must be consistent. It cannot shirk its duty and discard its Charter in regard to terrorism. We must speak with one ' oice on this scourge  without equivocation  because terrorism  no matter where it may erupt or what its current guise  cannot shed its essential characteristics: it is beyond the pale of order  of law  of decency  of society and of humanity. We cannot for selfish or regional reasons move to stamp it out in one form or in one region  while encouraging it in another. It is obvious that this merely guarantees its survival and its spread. And yet  the records of this Assembly abound in expressions serving as encouragement to those committed to violence as a means of achieving their political objectives. Furthermore  at the very time of the Munich outrage  plans were openly being laid for stepping up terrorism in Africa. Terrorism will survive so long as this and other Organizations continue not only to condone the use of force and violence as a means to an end but  in certain circumstances  to support and even to subsidize it.18.	We deplore this attitude. South Africa cannot and will not compromise on the issue of terrorism. We have not hesitated to take drastic action against it in the past  and we shall fight it with all means at our disposal in the future. I much regret  I might add  that even while the Secretary- General and the South African Government are engaged in discussions on the future of South West Africa  with progress already registered  some individuals and organizations  and even some Governments represented here  should still openly advocate the use of force and violence in that Territory.19.	So far as the contacts between the Secretary-General and my Government are concerned  this is obviously not the opportune moment for me to speak on them at any length. There is no denying that the gap to be bridged is wide and deep  and it cannot be expected that a solution will be found overnight.. Time  perseverance and patience will clearly be required. Nevertheless  we sincerely hope that goodwill  mutual trust and understanding will prevail on all sides and that in this atmosphere progress will be possible. I want again to reaffirm that  so far as South West Africa is concerned  the South African Government is firmly committed to the principle of self-determination and independence with all that this implies  and we shall continue to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in the search for a solution.20.	.In the meantime  South Africa is continuing to assist in the development of the Territory and the advancement of its peoples in all spheres so that they may achieve the declared goal of self-determination and independence as rapidly as possible. During the last two generations we have made a considerable contribution to the Territory's development. I may also mention that  by virtue of South African legislation  all revenue collected in South West Africa  including taxation on foreign investments  is applied there exclusively for the benefit of all the inhabitants. In addition  South Africa itself annually contributes directly and indirectly a substantial amount to the Territory's development. In 1972 this additional contribution by the south African Government  on current account alone  is estimated at $80 million  an amount which very nearly equals South West Africa's own estimated revenue receipts. We shall be more than prepared to continue to assist the peoples of the Territory after independence  if that is what they desire; and we are in a good position to do so  because of our close association with South West Africa over many years  our geographic proximity and our links in numerous fields; but it will be clear that our assistance then cannot be on the same scale as it is today. Even now the growing needs of the indigenous peoples can hardly be met from local and South African resources combined.21.	After independence  therefore  as in the case of most newly independent States  they will inevitably continue to look beyond their borders for assistance.22.	In all the circumstances  we simply cannot understand the motives of those who discourage new foreign investment or call for the cessation of existing foreign investment in South West Africa. It cannot be in the interest of the peoples of the Territory to deprive them of the contribution to their welfare which overseas investors make in the context of their business operations there  for it is the inhabitants themselves who gain from such investments. And it must surely be clear that  the closer we move in the direction of self-determination and independence  the more important foreign investment becomes in developing the essential economic launching-pad which new States need in order to get off to a sound start. An attempt to retard the economic growth of the Territory simply means a prolongation of its economic dependence upon others. I would ask those discouraging  or advocating a withdrawal of  investments in South West Africa at least to take account of the wishes of the inhabitants of the Territory  and to cease arrogating to themselves exclusively the privilege of deciding what is in their best interests.23.	From what I have said today  it should be clear that South Africa has adopted an approach to its problems and its relations with other countries which is not out of tune with the current trend of negotiation and detente now influencing international relations. This applies both to the conduct of South Africa's internal affairs and to the wider international sphere.24.	I have in mind  in this regard  relations  with our neighbors as well as with the United Nations. We subscribe to this policy because we are convinced that  provided our efforts are not undermined by external influences  it will promote peace in our part of the world.25.	It should not be necessary to commend a similar approach to Members of this Organization  since that approach is implicit in the Charter. But a return to the Charter in this respect might lead the Organization to higher levels of achievement in the pursuit of its principal objective: international peace "
"124",7601,"ZMB",27,1972,"Mr. President  my delegation warmly congratulates you upon your election to the high office of President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Not only are you eminently qualified for the task  but also you are a representative of a great country which has made valuable contributions towards international peace and security  particularly in the field of human freedom and justice. I wish to assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of your heavy responsibility.2.	Permit me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Adam Malik  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  who presided over the proceedings of the twenty-sixth session with distinction.3.	Although I had occasion elsewhere to extend our sincere congratulations and best wishes to our new Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  I should like to renew those sentiments. In this connexion ' I wish to reassure him of the support and co-operation of the Government of Zambia in the performance of his very important and difficult duties.4.	Significant developments have taken place since the twenty-sixth session. Recently  foreign ministers of non- aligned countries met in Georgetown  Guyana  and it was clear from the number and level of participants that the non-aligned movement has not only grown through new membership but has also increased its commitment.5.	As I pay a tribute to the Government and people of Guyana for the Excellent organization of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Georgetown from 8 to 12 August 1972  and the warm hospitality extended to participants  it is important to stress the fact that for the first time the non-aligned nations paid special attention to areas of economic co-operation. The outcome was a program of action for economic co-operation  whose implementation should  inter alia  increase self-reliance.6.	Furthermore  it was evident that the non-aligned movement was becoming increasingly determined to stamp out oppression and foreign domination in all its forms and manifestations. The movement has also shown in practical terms its resolve to support those who are fighting for human freedom. Zambia  like other Member States  is proud to belong to a movement which is committed to peace  justice and progress in the world.7.	The restoration last year of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in this Organization was both a welcome and a significant development. China has consistently supported and assisted peoples struggling for their freedom. It is committed to the cause of peace. The recent normalization of relations between China and Japan  which we warmly welcome  is but one example of the genuine efforts of China in this regard. Since its emergence in 1949  after devastating and protracted wars  the People's Republic of China has developed on the basis of self-reliance. Its experience in this respect is relevant to many developing countries.8.	The contacts of Washington with Peking and Moscow have brought some change in their relations. We welcome this trend because it brings relief to many nations of the world which  for the past quarter of a century  have been very concerned about the East-West confrontation. Indeed  we welcome also the efforts towards detente in Europe and hope that these will contribute to international peace and security in our time.9.	However  while this change on the part of big Powers is indeed"" welcome  it appears to create difficulties for the United Nations in its endeavor to discover its place in this limited detente  which carries some very negative elements of military superiority and big Power monopoly in the decision-making process affecting the entire human race. It is well known that monopolistic tendencies are not only contrary to the democratization of international relations and the realization of peace  justice and progress  but also to the principles of independence and sovereignty.10.	In Georgetown  Guyana  the foreign ministers of non-aligned countries ""expressed their solidarity with the struggle of the heroic people of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos for their self-determination. These people had been subjected to the ravages of war for decades  and had suffered incalculable losses  both human and material. But the brutal war which was being waged against the people of Viet-Nam  Cambodia and Laos had only strengthened their will. It was heartening to note that they were continuing their struggle with renewed vigour and perseverance."" 11.	The escalation of the United States war in Viet-Nam  which now includes the use of F-ll jet bombers  is aggravating the already serious situation in terms of untold suffering  loss of life and property in Indo-China. This is an act of United States terrorism against the Viet-Nam people and must be condemned in the strongest terms. It must be emphasized that in South-East Asia vast areas are being laid waste by the most inhuman and unparalleled use of devastating chemical weapons and defoliants contrary to the Geneva Protocol of 1925  and to the spirit of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in June of this year.12.	The United States forces must immediately stop all bombing of the innocent people of Viet-Nam. We still believe that the only basis for a just and lasting peace in South-East Asia is for the United States of America to respond to the seven-point peace plan as enunciated by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.13.	Turning now to the Indian subcontinent  we commend President Bhutto and Prime Minister Gandhi for their efforts which led to the relaxation of tension  culminating on 3 July in the Simla Agreement.14.	Zambia has always supported the reunification of Korea. In this connexion we welcome the bilateral contacts and discussions which are aimed at creating favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of that country without outside interference.15.	The Zambia delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the 10 Members of the Committee of African heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for their efforts to help the United Nations find a solution to the problem of the Middle East.16.	It is a fact that very many Palestinians have been displaced and are without shelter. Under these circumstances  frustration  despair and bitterness are inevitable. We should try to solve the underlying cause of the problem. Often we tend to spend much time discussing the effect instead of addressing ourselves to the cause. We want peace  security and justice for all the people in the region.17.	We believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) provides a basis for the settlement of the problem  but the self-interest of the big Powers seems to' complicate further efforts aimed at reaching a just and lasting settlement.18.	The grave situation in southern Africa and Guinea (Bissau) continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Both the spirit and the decisions  of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Rabat  Morocco  from 12 to 15 June 1972  demonstrate that the people of Africa are resolved to free every inch of their continent from foreign domination. The oppressed people fighting for their freedom are entitled to support from the international community to enable them to achieve their total liberation. In the non-aligned movement this support is already assured  as was once again demonstrated at the Gerogetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries.19.	Since my address to this Assembly last year [1945th meeting] the liberation movements in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) have continued to gain ground in their struggle for freedom. The liberated areas have been visited by groups of people and individuals and given support from different parts of the world. We are also aware of the experiences of the three-man Special Mission of the United Nations which visited Guinea (Bissau) last April  spending a total of 130 hours inside the liberated areas of that Territory without finding any evidence of Portuguese administration or control. Portugal must accept its defeat in these areas.20.	It is disquieting to note that some Western countries continue to make available to Portugal chemical means of warfare which are used against the African people in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). Besides committing acts of genocide  fascist Portugal continues to use defoliants on cassava  sweet potatoes and other crops in many of the inhabited areas  resulting in total destruction of food crops. This has brought about serious famine in the areas affected. This kind of savagery and irresponsibility by Portugal should be condemned. Appropriate measures should be taken by the countries which supply Portugal with these weapons to ensure that it does not acquire and use them.21.	I therefore wish to appeal to all peace-loving nations to increase their moral and material assistance to the liberation movements in these Territories. I am aware that a number of countries have given  and continue to give  considerable material assistance to these movements. To them I express Zambia's sincere appreciation. However  there are other countries which have thrown overboard all the principles and ethics upon which they molded their own nationhood. They have instead clung to policies of self-interest and inhumanity by aiding the forces of colonialism and racism in Africa.22.	I now wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to another aspect of the liberation struggle in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau). I mentioned earlier that large areas of these Territories have been liberated and are under the complete control of the liberation movements. In those areas the life of the people must continue to be sustained. These people need  and must have  adequate food  health and educational services. They also require transport facilities to ensure the effective distribution of supplies in those areas.23.	I am convinced that in this field the specialized agencies of the United Nations not only have the capacity to provide these services to the liberated areas but they have an urgent and moral obligation to provide the required assistance in accordance v ;th General Assembly resolution 2874 (XXVI) and other relevant resolutions. These areas are administered as autonomous units and accordingly ought to be offered multilateral assistance by specialized agencies. For the purposes of assistance  these areas should be considered to be least developed among the developing countries  as defined by the Committee for Development Planning of the Economic and Social Council  and should  therefore  be eligible for the special measures envisaged in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)].24.	The problem of rule by the racist illegal minority in Zimbabwe remains one which preoccupies the United Nations and the international community as a whole. I expressed the views of my delegation on this pressing question in my statement to the Security Council on Wednesday  27 September 1972.  I should like  however  to repeat my call to the British Government to convene without delay a constitutional conference at which all sections of the people of Zimbabwe would freely express their views on the kind of government they would desire for their country. My Government will continue to support the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle to achieve self-determination and independence on the basis of majority rule.25.	The question of Namibia continues to pose a serious challenge to the authority of the United Nations  which is directly responsible for the administration of that Territory. The grave situation created by South Africa's continued illegal occupation of that Territory demands that urgent and effective measures be taken by the Organization  and in particular by the Security Council  to end the illegal occupation forthwith.26.	We strongly condemn the Fascist and racist regime in Pretoria for its extension of the obnoxious policy of apartheid to Nambia and for the balkanization of that Territory. We are aware that South Africa's continued defiance of the Organization's decisions and resolutions has been sustained by the support of certain Western countries which have vested economic and other interests in Namibia. We condemn all these countries which continue to support and protect the South African racists. Zambia will continue to render assistance to the people of Namibia in the struggle for their self-determination and independence as a unitary State.27.	A great deal of literature and information on the evils of apartheid has been made available through various news media to the world community. At the twenty-sixth session  the General Assembly adopted a very comprehensive resolution-resolution 2775 (XXVI)-on apartheid  which not only is a crime against humanity but also cuts across the very fabric of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore I wish to echo the appeal that has been made from time to time to implement the various Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the elimination of apartheid. In this connexion my delegation welcomes the draft program for a decade for action to combat racism and racial discrimination presented by the Secretary-General under resolutions 2784 (XXVI) and 2785 (XXVI)[A/8805  annex] 28.	Zambia supports fully the proposed program for the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted on 10 December 1948 by this Assembly [A/8820]. In marking this anniversary  the United Nations should consider taking effective measures against the minority racist and oppressive regime in Africa and other parts of the world which continue to violate the articles of this important document.29.	I should now like to address myself to another disturbing matter which is perhaps the main factor delaying the attainment of complete self-determination and independence in Africa. I refer to the economic and military involvement of certain Western countries in areas of Africa where the indigenous people are still striving for their independence. The United States importation of chrome from Rhodesia is one of the most flagrant violations by a Member of this Organization. The action is not based on the needs of the United States for chrome  as was pointed out by my colleagues the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Sudan and the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Kenya during the Security Council debate on Rhodesia on 28 September.  The decision has undoubtedly frustrated and considerably weakened efforts to combat racism and illegal minority rule in Southern Rhodesia.30.	There are other Western countries  particularly the United Kingdom and France  which continue to sell arms to South Africa. We deplore this contravention of Security Council resolutions on the arms embargo. In this connexion  my Government has on previous occasions also spoken out against similar activities by a number of other Western countries. All these retrogressive acts must stand condemned in the strongest terms by this Organization.31.	In this respect I want to pay a tribute to individuals and organizations in some Western countries that have recognized the justification and the legitimacy of the struggle taking place in Africa and are doing everything possible to influence their Governments to cease these callous acts. To them I offer my appreciation and every encouragement.32.	It is particularly disquieting to note that the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTADJ  held in Santiago  Chile  in April and May of this year  did not bring about any significant openings in the field of trade. Resolutions were passed in the hope that they would contribute to the economic development of the developing countries. Time and again resolutions presented by the Group of 77 developing countries were either watered down beyond recognition or rejected outright by the developed countries. That kind of attitude should not be allowed to persist. In the presence of political goodwill  no obstacle is insurmountable.33.	It must be pointed out  however  that the non-aligned countries and other developing countries are aware that the prime responsibility for their economic development rests with them. Accordingly  at the Georgetown Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  an action program for economic co-operation among non-aligned countries was drawn up. The measures included in the program are many and cover fields such as trade  finance  investment  research  the transfer of technology and institutional arrangements for economic co-operation and co-ordination. The purpose of the action plan is to strengthen the non-aligned movement economically and raise the standard of living of its members.34.	General and complete disarmament under effective international control remains the most imperative and urgent need of our time. the disheartening arms race is still far from being controlled. It is a major contribution to mounting tension in various parts of the world and it certainly is inimical to international peace and security. Needless to say  the development and the production of nuclear weapons threaten the existence of man and his environment.35.	It is in the light of this grave situation that we must act quickly  not only to halt the senseless and wasteful arms race but also to Catty out measures for the complete destruction of the weapons of war already in the arsenals of States. If we genuinely want peace for ourselves and for future generations  we have no excuse for not providing its only irUe guarantee: general and complete disarmament under effective international control.36.	The position of Zambia and other non-aligned countries is reflected in clear terms in the Lusaka Declaration and more recently in the Statement on International Security and Disarmament adopted by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries and issued in Georgetown  Guyana  in August 1972. We take note of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826(XXVI)i annexJ. However  Zambia would like to see concluded as Soon as possible a convention on the total prohibition of chemical weapons and their elimination from the arsenals; of States. While we welcome the recent partial agreement reached between the United States and the USSR of the limitation of strategic arms   we note with regret that the agreement does not include any limitation of qualitative improvements in the nuclear weapons of the two Powers. We would like to see the early elimination of all nuclear stockpiles in the world.37.	Since matters of international security affect all of us  we strongly believe that all nations of the world should participate fully in the discussion of such matters. We therefore welcome the proposal to convene a World Disarmament Conference  at which we hope all States  nuclear and non-nuclear  will participate as equals. In our view  the basic aim of that conference should be to make a positive effort to achieve progress toward general and complete disarmament  and primarily towards the banning and destruction of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.38.	I should like to refer to the lack of effective international law governing the seas  which cover approximately three-quarters of this planet. At present  technologically advanced countries are engaged in eroding the freedom of the seas by making dangerous incursions into ocean space and thereby threatening freedom of navigation  depleting marine life and causing pollution. Land-locked countries have a particular and special interest in sharing in the exploitation of the riches of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  considering that they are excluded from participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the sea  not only in territorial waters but also in adjacent waters and fishing zones  and have no access to the wealth of the continental shelf.39.	On the vitally important question of transit and free access to the sea  we believe that this right should be embodied in the international instrument which may result from the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea.40.	Specialized agencies  such as the ILO  FAO  UNESCO  UNICEF  WHO and UNIDO  have greatly assisted the developing countries in their particular fields of operations. The adoption in 1970 of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade made the role of the regional economic commissions and the specialized agencies even more important; and as their funds depend mainly on voluntary contributions  the international community should give generously to enable them to fulfill their duties efficiently.41.	We are  however  aware of the growing crisis of confidence in the ability and authority of the United Nations to deal effectively with pressing international problems such as the achievement of human freedom and independence. That crisis of confidence arises out of the frustration and despair of the international community.42.	The Government of the Republic of Zambia shares the concern and the view that there is a great and urgent need for change in the attitude of the super-Powers and for restructuring the Organization in order to meet the demands of the changed situation. In this connexion  we are convinced that the tendency on the part of the superPowers to by-pass the United Nations in dealing with some problems of vital importance and interest to the whole of the international community has the continued effect of eroding the prestige and the authority of the Organization.43.	It is imperative that the principle of. equality of membership and of equitable geographical representation be applied. In this regard  the Security Council  as the main organ charged with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security  needs to be changed. It must cease to be a preserve of the big Powers where they can use their power of veto at will in order to protect their interests and those of their allies. Only last week the representative of the United Kingdom cast a negative vote in the Security Council in defense of the illegal racist regime in Southern Rhodesia. The Security Council must be transformed into a body that will truly reflect the changed circumstances. To that end  one wonders whether the criteria for eligibility for new permanent membership in the future should not be reviewed so as to ensure that they are based  not on military or economic power  but rather on the principle of equitable geographical representation. In any case  the developing countries make a significant contribution towards the economic well-being of some permanent members of the Security Council. Also we do not agree that economic might necessarily reflects sound political morality. We submit that there is a great need to increase the present number of permanent members to enable other geographical regions to be represented on the Council.44.	In the meantime  we are convinced of the urgent need for taking appropriate measures aimed at eliminating the veto or at least its misuse. It is disturbing that the Organization  comprising 132 Member States  can allow itself to be rendered impotent in the discharge of its solemn duty by the use of the veto in the Security Council by one permanent Member State  regardless of the gravity of the situation involved.45.	In conclusion I wish to reaffirm Zambia's support for the United Nations and our commitment to support any efforts designed to strengthen it. I earnestly hope that this Organization will continue to foster co-operation in the international community and to further the cause of human freedom  peace and justice."
