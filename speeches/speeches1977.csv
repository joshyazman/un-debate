"1",7,"AFG",32,1977,"﻿212.	 On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan  I should like to join the representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the high office of President of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It gives us particular satisfaction to see a distinguished son of Yugoslavia — a country with which Afghanistan enjoys very close ties of friendship and co-operation-occupying this important position. We are confident that your very able and wise guidance will lead us to the successful conclusion of our deliberations.213.	Allow me to seize this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  for the efficient manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session of the General Assembly.214.	We should also like at this juncture to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the dedication that he has unfailingly demonstrated in his ceaseless efforts in promoting the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.215.	It is a source of great satisfaction to welcome in our midst the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as States Members of the United Nations. It is a matter of joy for our delegation to welcome the independence of Djibouti from colonial rule and alien domination and its entry into the United Nations as a sovereign Member State. We are indeed happy that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  a member of the non- aligned movement  has finally joined the family of nations. The admission of these two countries brings us closer to the goal of universality of the United Nations  a goal to which our Government is ardently committed.216.	We have once again gathered here to take stock of what has been achieved in the years that have elapsed and  basing ourselves on past experience  to try to chart a better course for coping with the challenges confronting us.217.	While this Assembly provides a welcome forum for drawing up a balance-sheet of failures and achievements  it is heart-breaking to realize that our performance always falls short of our expectations concerning solutions for problems of peace and co-operation. The balance-sheet to which I referred has unfortunately been so often negative that even the usefulness of our gatherings and the necessity of our deliberations are being questioned. The helplessness of this Organization in dealing with issues that face it and the extremely slow pace of our progress in composing our differences regarding them have caused great disillusionment  especially among the people of the third world.218.	Year in and year out we assemble and deliberate here and in other forums to seek ways and means of building a better world based on understanding and justice  but either our decisions resulting from those gatherings remain un- implemented or  as is often the case  we fail to agree altogether—no matter what the urgency or the importance of the issue. Such stagnation entitles those whom we represent to ask whether there is something wrong with the system of international co-operation  or whether the principles of the Charter have become obsolete and are no longer applicable to present-day situations. Viewing the contradictions that we are unsuccessful in removing  people everywhere in their perplexity ask themselves  for example. How is it possible that an expansionist country like Israel  in spite of all the United Nations resolutions  continues to enjoy immunity? Why is it that a new international economic order  the need for which is apparently no longer questioned  should be so difficult to establish? Why is it that in Zimbabwe the illegal regime arrogantly maintains itself in power while the international community helplessly watches? Why is it that Namibia is still occupied by South Africa  and why in this day and age is the abject policy of apartheid flourishing in that country?219.	I submit that there can be nothing wrong with the universal principles of the Charter or with the aims of the conferences that we usually attend. What must be wrong  therefore  is the lack of political willingness on the part of the Member States to bring into being a more effective United Nations and our reluctance to accept to be guided in international gatherings by the norms of reason and justice. This attitude very often prevents a sound operation and consequently damages the very fabric of international understanding. The proponents of such policies unfortunately fail to realize that decisions based  on justice and equity and aimed at benefiting the majority will in the long run be advantageous to all concerned  white and black  North and South.220.	I believe that it would not be out of context if I said that sometimes  because of influences that cannot be termed altogether unselfish  the composition of some international gatherings does not reflect the existing reality  and that is perhaps one of the reasons why they are not successful in dealing with the problems facing them. To mention but one example  I wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that the least developed  land-locked countries were not represented at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris.How can a meeting which ignores the existence of such an important section of the international community and its problems safeguard the interests of the least developed  land-locked countries and consequently reach decisions benefiting the whole of mankind  including those countries? After all  no other countries are better acquainted with their problems and can defend their interests better. To remedy that deficiency  I .propose that in future that factor should be taken into consideration.221.	Another disappointing factor which seems to erode co-operation is apathy with regard to the problems of others  especially the most needy in the international community. This lack of solidarity is indeed bewildering. A case in point illustrating this state of affairs is the complete absence of enthusiasm shown by the wealthy nations with regard to the special fund created in favour of land-locked countries. Representatives are aware that  after crossing 101 hurdles—which in itself conveyed a rather poor image of international solidarity-we succeeded in establishing that fund. But now that at last it has come into being the cold-shoulder treatment to which it has been submitted is  to say the least  quite frustrating.222.	Having made those observations  I should now like to state briefly the policy and position of my country in respect to certain issues.223.	The Republic of Afghanistan has always endeavoured and will continue to endeavour to establish friendly and peaceful relations with all peace-loving countries  including those of our region  in order to develop its relations and co-operation for the benefit of the peoples of the world and of the region.224.	With respect to Pakistan  as has been stated in this Assembly in the past  Afghanistan had and still has one political difference. Last year in the General Assembly I expressed the hope that the only political difference between us could be resolved. I avail myself of this opportunity to state that it is our hope that the efforts of Afghanistan and Pakistan that have already begun for a just and honourable solution of that political difference will lead in the future to a successful conclusion in accordance with the consent and satisfaction of all the parties concerned.225.	With regard to the problems of the Middle East  not just and durable peace will be achieved without the complete withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories and the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of self- determination and the establishment of a Palestinian State in their fatherland  as the question of Palestine forms the core of the Middle East problem. For the attainment of these purposes the full participation of the representatives of the PLO in any future negotiations on an equal basis is indeed necessary. In view of the recent development we are of the opinion that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) needs to be supplemented.226.	The delegation of Afghanistan has always been of the conviction that durable peace could only be attained if general and complete disarmament  under effective control  is achieved and if a significant part of the resources thus released is devoted to the economic and social needs of the developing countries  among them the least developed in particular. Afghanistan  together with the non-aligned countries  supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly in 1978 devoted to issues relating to disarmament. We believe that by convening such a special session for a comprehensive review of the issues involved it would be possible to take the necessary effective measures towards the achievement of the goal of general and complete disarmament.227.	The extreme imbalances in economic development between the developing and developed countries is in itself a constant and aggravating danger to the maintenance of world harmony and co-operation. Unfortunately  we notice with regret and concern the ever-widening gap between the developed and developing countries in development and trade. Despite professions of the rectification and/or amelioration of their adverse terms of trade  no positive action has been taken so far. Runaway and aggravated inflation  compounded by recession emanating from the developed countries together with arbitrary monetary manipulations  has set in motion a vicious inflationary- cum-recessionary cycle with far-reaching negative effects which leads to detrimental imbalances of the economies of the developing countries as the whole and  in particular  of the more vulnerable economies of the least developed  land-locked  island developing and most seriously affected developing countries.228.	The problem of the soaring and ever-increasing external debt of the developing  and especially of the least developed  countries  remains unsolved  with only unsatisfactory and inadequate efforts  if any  having been made towards their rectification or  amelioration. No real or long-term solution to this problem was achieved at the recent Paris Conference.229.	The inalienable right of free access to and from the sea of the land-locked countries  whose additional transportation  transit and transhipment costs constitute a major obstacle and impediment to their development efforts  remains to be implemented.230.	I believe it would be good for us to ponder on the reflections that I have had the honour to share with this Assembly; reflections that I am sure are not exclusively mine. It is high time for us to rededicate ourselves to the high ideals and principles of the Charter and free ourselves of bias and see in this world something other than our own narrow and selfish interests. We have to co-operate in all sincerity to build a better world based on justice and equality  and share the benefits of human civilization which undeniably belong to the whole of mankind. Unless we do so our present meeting and even our future ones will remain meaningless  and our deliberations could be nothing more than exercises in futility.231.	In conclusion  I should like to state very briefly that mankind will survive together in hope and faith or give way to despair and destruction. We may seem at present as though we are unsure of ourselves and groping to find our way. Economic difficulties  political tension and the uncertainty of the future bring many problems to the surface. The past may or may not inspire us  but it is the needs of the present and the challenges of the future that must constitute the driving force for a united action in the attainment of world peace and the establishment of an international economic order that would ensure the progress and prosperity of peoples everywhere. The cause of peace is not advanced by political means alone. To be realistic and enduring peace must be buttressed by the economic potentialities of all nations."
"2",47,"AGO",32,1977,"﻿42.	 Almost one year ago  the young People's Republic of Angola was historically and officially admitted as a full Member to the United Nations. The time that has since elapsed has not yet been sufficient to efface from the Angolan people's memory the struggle waged by their revolutionary vanguard against the anachronistic  anti-democratic and hostile attitude taken by the United States of America in the Security Council when it delayed and vetoed the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Angola.43.	On 1 December 1976  when the People's Republic of Angola for the first time made its voice heard from this rostrum  it was stated that our admission to this world body was not just a victory for the Angolan people: it was a victory for all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples  - a victory for all the progressive forces and countries which supported our long and hard national liberation struggle. But it was an incomplete victory  because we were not at the same time celebrating the admission of the glorious Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Today  however  the picture of that victory is complete  and tomorrow it will assume even greater proportions with the inevitable admission of other independent countries.44.	Permit us now  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola  to extend our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly and to wish you every success in the fulfilment of your arduous task.45.	We should like to convey to the President of the thirty-first session our appreciation of the outstanding services he rendered during the period in which he was invested with the same high responsibilities  and »5so to express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations our deep gratitude for the great dedication he has brought to the solution of various grave problems with which both the People's Republic of Angola and the international community have had to deal.46.	The foreign policy of the People's Republic of Angola is governed by unequivocal guiding principles  which we should like to recall and indeed to reaffirm: the establishment and maintenance of diplomatic relations with all countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity  non- aggression  non-interference in internal affairs  equal and reciprocal advantage  peaceful coexistence and non- alignment; respect for the principles of the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity; the intransigent safeguarding of our complete national independence and of our socialist option; the diversification of relations of co-operation in the most varied fields; militant solidarity with the national liberation movements  with oppressed peoples and with the struggle of the workers of the whole world  on the basis of proletarian internationalism; and the progressive strengthening of bonds of friendship and co-operation with the socialist community and anti-imperialist communities of every continent.47.	However  despite the clarity and indeed the universality of most of the principles enunciated  the People's Republic of Angola and hence the Angolan people are still faced with a lack of any kind of understanding  with accusations and labels 'with biased press campaigns  with divisive manoeuvring and multiform offensives orchestrated by the imperialist Powers with the connivance of external and internal agents  all aimed at the annihilation of the revolutionary process now in progress  the establishment of neo-colonialism and the consequent paralysis of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa  with grave consequences for the other front-line States.48.	The Government of the People's Republic of Angola will not fail therefore to speak out in accordance with the principles that guide it  or to act with the authority and responsibility vested in it so as duly to comply with the duties and obligations it has assumed vis-à-vis the Angolan people and the progressive international community. By this we mean that we intend to face problems objectively and not to resort to compromise merely as a way of finding provisional solutions or of concealing a lack of political courage in the face of the complexity or delicate nature of some situation or another. This implies that we shall clearly  honestly and courageously assume the responsibilities of our positions and options.49.	The present state of international political affairs is essentially characterized by a multiplicity of conflicts of different types. No one in this Assembly can or should be unaware that the growing contradiction between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp has shifted the scene of military confrontation from South-East Asia to the African continent  where  as a result of the resounding defeat of North American imperialism in Viet Nam and the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire  an offensive is being mounted by certain imperialist Powers in the form of indirect intervention  the immediate effect of which is the destabilization of progressive African regimes.50.	A brief analysis of the international panorama shows that the direct confrontation of the peoples with imperialism  neo-colonialism  colonialism  Zionism  apartheid and the exploitation of man by man is still an incontestable reality in the present era. Peace is therefore far from being assured in all parts of the world  because we are still witnessing a frenzied arms race  the perpetuation of colonial wars  all manner of aggression against independent States  foreign domination and occupation  economic plunder and a proliferation of plots by the imperialist Powers against the national sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of States.51.	At the same time  and in particular  the shameful armed aggression against Benin; the heinous assassination of the President of the People's Republic of the Congo  Marien Ngouabi; the criminal attempted coup d’état in Angola organized by a group of factionalists serving foreign interests; the armed aggression and incursions carried out by the racist and Fascist regimes ""of so-called Rhodesia and South Africa against Mozambique  Zambia  Botswana and Angola; the military conflicts between contiguous African countries; the fostering of subversion and counterrevolution in certain African countries; the troop movements north and south of Angola's borders; the financial  material and even logistic support given to Angolan puppet organizations  and so forth—all this is a very clear indication of the aggressive designs of international imperialism on the African continent.52.	In view of this somewhat gloomy picture  and in order better to face up to imperialist manoeuvres  it seems to us essential that there should be joint action  particularly within the framework of the movement of non-aligned countries  whereby each nation would ensure its complete national independence by taking national resources into its own hands and exploiting them for the benefit of its people; reject any form of subordination and dependence and any interference or pressure whatsoever  whether of a political  an economic or a military nature; prohibit the establishment of foreign military bases on its national territory and support all those fighting for the dismantling of such bases  which are generally imposed or maintained against the will of the people; seriously devote every effort to a necessary and effective international detente  to general and complete disarmament  and to the implementation of measures designed to strengthen international security and to ensure a total ban on the production and use of any kind of chemical  bacteriological or nuclear weapons  including the neutron bomb; prevent by every means the Indian Ocean from becoming the scene of any military confrontation and contribute decisively to its maintenance as a zone of peace; put into effect  as far as possible  development programmes which can be defended against economic blocs; and firmly support genuine national liberation movements in every possible way.53.	However  one of the most serious problems to be faced over the coming years  especially for under-developed countries  will undoubtedly be the economic crisis in the capitalist world  essentially characterized by rising inflation and growing unemployment  by the diminished level of real profits from the export of commodities from underdeveloped countries and the growing indebtedness of those same countries.54.	In the face of this situation  which basically affects the countries of the so-called third world  practical ways must be devised of applying the oft-repeated principles concerning the establishment of a new world economic order founded essentially on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interest and co-operation between States.55.	It has therefore become necessary to act in such a way as effectively to create a new equilibrium in international economic relations based on social justice  human dignity and the inalienable right of peoples to exercise total and permanent sovereignty over their national resources and freely to use and dispose of those resources.56.	In the course of two years of independence  the Angolan people and the Government of the People's Republic of Angola  under the leadership of the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola  and of their far-sighted leader  Mr. Agostinho Neto  have managed to overcome a series of difficulties and obstacles. With each passing day and month  they become ever more involved in the great and inspiring battle for national reconstruction in order to respond more adequately to the interests of the most exploited strata and to build a truly socialist society. At the same time they are preparing for an event of great historical significance: the holding of the first Congress of the MPLA and the creation of the party of the working class.57.	Despite the invasions from the north and the south by the regular armies of Zaire and South Africa  together with bands of puppets and mercenaries supported by certain Western Powers and certain French-speaking African countries; despite the destruction and plunder carried out by those same forces  with material damages estimated at S6 700 million  for which compensation has not yet been paid; and despite the flight and departure of technical cadres  most of them Portuguese—all factors which caused the paralysis of internal trade and of industrial and agricultural units and the consequent sudden sharp decline in production—it is absolutely undeniable that quite positive and encouraging result have already been achieved  especially in the fields of education  health  agriculture  industry  fisheries  construction  the economy  internal and external trade  and national defence.58.	In this respect  there is still a state of emergency in the People's Republic of Angola  and the tremendous efforts made in the task of national reconstruction have not as yet made it possible to attain the production levels reached in 1973  the last year of Portuguese colonial domination.59.	For all the foregoing reasons  the so-called gross national product in the People's Republic of Angola is today very much lower than S300-that is  S250 per capita. Hence  we have good reason to regard ourselves as being among the least developed countries  and we are justified in our appeals for assistance to many types of international bodies and  in particular  to the specialized agencies of the United Nations.60.	For the activity already carried out in the People's Republic of Angola by those specialized agencies  we must express our most sincere gratitude  particularly to UNDP and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  for the volume of assistance - and for the projects carried out or now in progress We express the same feelings of gratitude to all the countries and organizations which in this respect have  directly or indirectly  contributed to lessening the sufferings and the sacrifices of the Angolan people.61.	Because it is our understanding that the consolidation of the independence of the People's Republic of Angola should now lead to a more substantial contribution to the national liberation struggle of peoples still subject to colonial domination  and because we consider that the armed struggle waged by the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe  South Africa  the so-called Western Sahara and East Timor is still the most valid way for them to achieve their inalienable right to independence  we have  out of the most elementary spirit of militant solidarity and internationalist duty  assumed the responsibility of giving our support  in every possible way and in accordance with our modest possibilities  to their legitimate representatives  namely  SWAPO  the Patriotic Front  the African National Congress  the Frente POLISARIO and the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente.62.	However  there are certain considerations which come to our mind. In the first place  the various forms of support given to the Fascist and racist Pretoria and Salisbury regimes by the imperialist and neo-colonialist Powers  in particular the United States of America  France  the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom  such as the sale or supply of arms or military equipment  financial investment  the refusal to observe the embargo on arms and oil supplies and other decreed sanctions  and the provision of nuclear technology and the requisite equipment  constitute clear acts of aggression against the peoples of southern Africa and against the United Nations itself.63.	While it is true that we do not reject a priori the possibility of creating favourable conditions in Namibia and Zimbabwe for a negotiated settlement on the independence of those territories  it is no less true that we do not yet believe that a just solution to the existing antagonism can be found merely through talks between the so-called ""group of five"" and the Vorster regime—in the case of Namibia—or through the already rejected Anglo-American plan  in the case of Zimbabwe. Moreover  we still cannot conceive of the supporters of such regime really being able to convert themselves into sincere champions of the aspirations of the Namibian and Zimbabwean peoples.64.	In this connexion  we should like to recall that  as clearly stated by the President of the MPLA and of the People's Republic of Angola:"".. . only through armed struggle is it possible to defeat the oppressive forces in the world. It is not through negotiations  through conferences or councils  that the peoples will determine their own future  because there is a struggle of interests  a struggle between classes now developed through imperialism and through the desire of one social group to dominate all the others. It was armed struggle that led to the talks in Switzerland and it was armed struggle which brought the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia to the forefront. Without armed struggle  the national liberation struggles would have no vigour. It must therefore be intensified.""65.	What will be decisive for the People's Republic of Angola  however  will be the positions or decisions taken in the near future by SWAPO and the Patriotic Front.66.	Within the context of support for the armed struggle for national liberation  we consider that the democratic and progressive forces in the international community cannot remain indifferent or sit by with folded arms  as we have already openly stated  either with regard to the difficult and legitimate struggle of the Saharan people under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO  or with regard to the equally hard and legitimate struggle of the people of East Timor  led by FRETILIN  for their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. After the withdrawal of the former colonial Powers and in the light of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is inconceivable that  in the face of a certain conniving passivity  those two liberation movements should find themselves obliged to fight  weapons in hand  against foreign armed forces belonging to certain countries which are members of the non-aligned movement and which did not take up arms during the period of Spanish and Portuguese occupation. It seems to us indispensable that the State members of 041) and of the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples should assume  with urgency  their responsibilities.67.	In the context of solidarity with other struggling peoples  we should like once again to reaffirm our unconditional support for the Arab people of Palestine and their legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization  in their struggle against Zionism to recover their national rights and their homeland  which has been usurped by Israel. At the same time we support the full right of the Palestine Liberation Organization to take part in all negotiations concerning the solution of the situation in the Middle East. The absence of that Organization and the attempt to push it aside will make it impossible ever to halt or eliminate the conflict. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Korean people in their persistent efforts to reunify their country by peaceful means without any foreign interference in their internal affairs; and we again reaffirm our unreserved support for the people of Puerto Rico in their just struggle for their full right to self- determination and independence and against the annexation of the country to the territory of North America. We also reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Chilean people in their determined struggle to regain their freedom  their independence and their human dignity.68.	The Angolan people and their revolutionary vanguard  MPLA  who wish only to live in peace within their geographical boundaries  are conscious of their national and international duties  as well as of the dangers that surround them and the acts of aggression that are. being prepared against the People's Republic of Angola.69.	The Angolan people and their leading bodies are not unaware of the grave threats to which they are subject  coming on the one hand from the Zairian regime  which  apart from everything else  recently concluded a contract with the Orbital Transport and Raketen Company of the Federal Republic of Germany and  on the other hand  from the South African regime  which continues to train bands of puppets on Namibian territory and to infiltrate armed groups into Angolan territory to spread death and destruction among the population on the border  while their mentors  without the slightest scruple or even the least sense of the ridiculous  proclaim in certain European  American and African capitals that such and such provinces in the country have been occupied  although no one has seen them even in a commune or municipality70.	The consequences of these designs  which can prove disastrous  are already the full responsibility of certain Governments of Western Powers and of certain French- speaking African countries.71.	In reaffirming our profound gratitude for the militant solidarity extended to the Angolan people by the socialist countries  particularly the Soviet Union and Cuba  and by progressive African countries and the democratic forces in general  we wish to assure the Assembly that nothing can deflect the Angolan people from the revolutionary course they have freely chosen.72.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain. "
"3",93,"ALB",32,1977,"﻿134.	 May I congratulate Mr. Mojsov on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly.135.	It is with great pleasure that we greet the admission to membership of the United Nations of two new Members: the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. We should like to avail ourselves of this opportunity to wish the heroic Vietnamese people success in their efforts to consolidate the victories they have achieved for the progress and prosperity of their country. We also wish the people of the Republic of Djibouti success in their efforts to strengthen their national independence and freely and independently to develop their country.136.	As at every session of the General Assembly  the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania wants to express the views of its Government on several important international problems which preoccupy the peoples of the world. We think that in the assessment of the situation existing in the world today there is no room for complacency and still less for euphoria. Events show that the international situation continues to be turbulent and fraught with dangers to peace and security.137.	The imperialist Powers  above all the United States of America and the Soviet Union  are persistently continuing their policy of war and aggression; they are threatening the freedom and independence of peoples  trying to stamp out wars of national liberation  dividing peoples and sovereign States and pitting them against each other in order to stir up incidents and even armed conflicts among them.138.	At the same time  United States imperialism  Soviet social-imperialism and the other reactionary forces are exerting strenuous efforts to exploit  in their own interests  the political and economic situation and the backwardness of some countries. In particular  that is being done to the detriment of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. The imperialist Powers are seeking to preserve at all costs the privileges that they have secured through violence  plunder and exploitation on those continents; they are trying to hamper their independent economic development and to inhibit the development of productive forces. They never willingly renounce their aim of keeping oil and other raw material resources under their control in order to dictate their prices on world markets.139.	However  imperialism  social-imperialism and reaction are not in a position to stamp out the struggle of peoples. We are witnessing a great development in the whole of international life and international relations  represented by the increasing growth  in both content and intensity  of the national and social consciousness of peoples. The struggle of the peoples for liberation  for the affirmation and for the defence of their independence and national sovereignty  and their efforts to become masters of the assets stolen from them by the imperialist Powers for centuries  to root out the remnants of colonialism  to cut the tentacles of multinational monopolies  to defend their national traditions and culture and to develop them further  are all playing an important role in the present historic world process.140.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania unreservedly supports the revolutionary and national liberation struggles of the peoples  and the efforts of democratic and progressive States to defend and affirm their national independence and to exercise their complete sovereignty over their national assets. The leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha has said:""Today  the majority of the peoples of the world are exerting great efforts and opposing by force colonial laws and neo-colonialist domination  rules  practices  customs and unequal agreements  old and new  established by the bourgeoisie in order to perpetuate its exploitation of peoples  its hateful distinctions and discriminations in international relations. The two super-Powers are trying by all manner of means to preserve and perpetuate those laws  to secure privileges for themselves and to enslave various peoples. The progressive peoples and democratic States which do not put up with that situation and an fighting for the establishment of sovereignty over their national assets  which are struggling to strengthen their political and economic independence and which are for equality and justice in international relations enjoy the complete solidarity and support of the Albanian people and State.""141.	The Albanian people have been and continue to be in solidarity with the just cause of the peoples of the whole world; in particular they are the friend of those peoples which are fighting for their freedom  independence and national sovereignty. They have great respect for the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America  who have ancient cultural traditions  who have a great yearning to live free and happy and who are courageously fighting for those lofty objectives.142.	Many of those peoples today are at war not only with the external enemy  which is made up of the super-Powers and the other imperialist States  but also against internal reaction. The external enemy  which in particular is represented by the two super-Powers  is the common enemy that should be fought by all  and especially by the peoples of those continents that languish under its domination or are threatened by it. The Albanian people  who have liberated themselves from their external and internal enemies and who hate foreign oppression and exploitation  want to see all the peoples which are fighting for their freedom and national independence free  independent and sovereign  and they are in complete solidarity with their just struggle.143.	We have never interfered  nor will we ever interfere  in the internal affairs of others; but we stand against all the reactionaries who  linked with the big imperialist Powers and playing their game  have become an obstacle to the peoples fighting to win their freedom and independence  to escape from poverty  to enjoy a new life and to utilize the assets of their countries for their own benefit. Nothing can unite the peoples in their struggle with the interests of the imperialists and the local reactionary politicians.144.	The Albanian people express their ardent desire for the complete freedom of all the fraternal peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America who have militant traditions and an advanced culture that in various epochs has flourished and shone forth from the pages of history. We are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of the world  and we support their just cause  despite the hostile stand adopted towards us by some of their ruling cliques  which we too hate as anti-popular. Our alliance with the peoples is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and of proletarian internationalism and on the policy of supporting the liberation movement; this is the reason for the existence of this friendship  solidarity and understanding between the peoples of the world's continents and little socialist Albania. Socialist Albania feels strong not only because it relies on its free and monolithic people-and that is of great importance-but also because it enjoys the support of the freedom-loving countries and peoples of the world. The Albanian people are friends with all the peoples; in particular they are linked in close friendship with the greatChinese people. In support of its rights socialist Albania has the sympathy of hundreds of millions of people in the world.145.	Herein lies one of our strengths  and this strength is directed against imperialism  social-imperialism and against all reactionaries and revisionists. Imperialism  social- imperialism  the revisionists and international reactionaries are striving to set up new empires  to forge new chains for the peoples. We are against these new chains; therefore  we love peoples  and they love us with all their hearts and fight together with us on one front.146.	In the present conditions it is more necessary than ever for the sovereign  freedom-loving and progressive peoples and sovereign States to increase their vigilance  to thwart the plans of their enemies  to prevent themselves from becoming pawns in that big and dangerous game which is being played by the imperialist Powers on a world-wide scale. Every day new events occur which show that one State is in conflict with another  and as soon as one fire is put out another flares up. This is clearly shown by the events in the Middle East  the conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia  the events in Angola and the strife in Zaire. Who is fanning' these fires? Who is causing these conflicts? Is it the peoples? No. The conflicts which exist today among some African countries and in various areas of the world have their roots primarily in the ""divide and rule"" policy of United States imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism. The peoples aspire to solidarity  love and brotherhood. And when we say so  we are not in the least indulging in idealistic dreams  but assessing things realistically. These situations arise because there are exploiting classes which fight against the exploited because  on a national as well as an international plane  there is a clash of conflicting and irreconcilable interests between these classes.147.	The interests of the peoples call for a courageous and determined struggle to strengthen independence and sovereignty against political  ideological  economic and military aggression  against imperialist intrigues and intervention. In order to keep in check the activities of big and powerful enemies backed by numerous resources  solid unity and true solidarity among the freedom-loving  progressive and democratic peoples and States is essential. The peoples achieve this unity and solidarity through determined struggle and concrete actions against all their enemies. The attempts to ignore essential differences among political forces in the world in the name of the unity and solidarity of the peoples and to reduce the question of unity to heterogeneous groupings of States expressed in algebraic and arithmetic figures  with the most varied political regimes and options ranging from those maintaining anti-imperialist stands to those imposed by imperialism on some peoples and countries—these attempts create confusion  leaving the imperialist Powers and some reactionary regimes a free field of activity to speculate on the aspirations of progressive peoples and States and to weaken the genuine anti- imperialist unity of peoples. The successes achieved by the various countries struggling for their independent political and economic development are not the result of the fact that they are united in various groupings  but are the result of their struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism. Imperialism and social-imperialism cannot be fought with success nor can complete freedom and independence be secured if those in their service are not combated as well.148.	Likewise it would be dangerous for the peoples and countries which have recently shaken off the colonial yoke if  in their efforts to strengthen their independence  they agree to join the old colonial Powers or the groupings of the imperialist Powers  which are maintaining not only many economic  cultural and military positions there  but are also trying to occupy new ones. The colonialism of former times has suffered defeat. But imperialism  whether old or new  lives on and the methods it employs to establish and extend neo-colonialism are even more refined and dangerous.149.	Life has borne out quite convincingly the fact that the two imperialist super-Powers  the United States of America and the Soviet Union  are equally dangerous  to the same extent and in the same degree  to the peoples and their freedom. Even if under certain conditions one of them is forced to change tactics because of the blows dealt it by peoples  that does not mean that it has become less dangerous and that it is abandoning its aggressive and expansionist policy. Experience has shown that when a people or a nation is threatened or oppressed by one super-Power  it does not mean that the other super-Power no longer poses any danger to them and  even less  that it has become their ""friend"". Events in many areas of the world  such as the Middle East  in Africa and in other parts  prove quite well that both super-Powers have the same aggressive and hegemonistic intentions and are feverishly seeking to share the spheres of influence or to snatch positions from each other. The leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  has said:"". .. both when the super-Powers work together and when they quarrel  it is others who pay the bill. The collusion and rivalry between the super-Powers are the two sides of the one contradictory reality  important expressions of the same imperialist strategy: to rob the peoples of their freedom and to dominate the world. They pose the same danger and this is why the two super-Powers are the main and greatest enemies of the peoples. That is why one must never rely on one imperialism to fight or escape from the other.""150.	Peoples are becoming ever more convinced that their liberation struggle can be crowned with success only when they fight unwaveringly and uncompromisingly against United States imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism  that the independence of States and national sovereignty  security and peace can be preserved and strengthened only by maintaining an unwavering stand in the face of the two super-Powers and the other imperialist powers.151.	For several years the two imperialist super-Powers have been indulging in demagogy and have been resorting to various machinations in order to force the peoples into accepting the dangerous idea that every country must seek protection under the umbrella of United States imperialism or Soviet social-imperialism  that they have no recourse but to accept the protection of its ""umbrella"". Of course  the peoples cannot accept placing themselves under the tutelage of one or the other super-Power or joining one of them in order to oppose the other only because they are beset with feuds and contradictions in the framework of their rivalry for domination and hegemony in the world.152.	The indignation of the peoples at colonial exploitation  tutelage  diktat and hegemony  national oppression and racial discrimination will rise to a boiling point. The subjective factors have already arisen and will also arise in the future  and the moment will come when the peoples will be free of all shackles. Shaking off the yoke of all foreign occupiers  the peoples themselves will achieve their national liberation and social emancipation. Socialism will achieve successes everywhere  for the peoples want it and dream about it  it is what they ""desire. Of course this can only be achieved through their joint efforts and resolute struggle  because the imperialists will never willingly lay down their arms.153.	The unity of the peoples in their fight for freedom  independence and social progress is essential. Unity is one of the main weapons of proletarian internationalism. The countries which are building socialism should do all they can to help the peoples fighting to achieve and preserve their national independence  as well as other peoples that aspire to advance on the road to socialism.154.	The so-called ""aid"" which the Soviet revisionists give other countries is not all sincere and free of self-interest; on the contrary  it is part of a policy of subjugation and coercion  of a chauvinist policy of a big State towards small nations. The revisionists' views about small nations are not in the least different from those of the imperialists. We say this advisedly  for we have had personal experience of it.155.	We are striving  and we shall always ""strive  to see that the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America are given sincere and disinterested aid which is free of any political condition and with no hidden motives. Only thus can true friendship be understood. Our Party and our State of the proletarian dictatorship have fought and will go on fighting courageously in that spirit and they are not alone in following this course. The peoples of the world are fighting together with them  among them the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America.156.	The concept of the relationship between the large States and the small States  between the large nations and the small nations  interpreted in the sense that the small must submit to the large is a deadly disease  a chauvinist concept  a survival from the past  a heritage of the capitalist-imperialist world outlook.157.	The progressive and freedom-loving peoples are waging and must continue to wage a ruthless struggle against this point of view. We- well appreciate the importance and the role of the large States and large nations  but one should also have a thorough and correct grasp of the importance and the role of the small countries and nations  no matter how small they may be. Every nation  whether large or small  makes its contribution to the cause of the freedom and progress of mankind. Life itself  practice and struggle make things clear  distinguish people  sort out who is on the side of the peoples and who is against them.158.	Here in the General Assembly the great Powers have said quite enough about small nations. When one listens to the statements of the representatives of the great Powers  the impression is given that their only concern is how to do good to the peoples of the small countries  how to take care of their progress and prosperity. But all this honey coming out of their mouths  all this alleged ""concern""  is but a sinister deception. The big Powers like to take the smaller countries by the hand  as if they were not able to walk on their own feet. They want to be their teachers and to treat them as if they were barbarians of the era of slavery  whereas they regard themselves as belonging to the nuclear age. They formulate a great number of proposals; they advocate the setting up of all sorts of organizations  allegedly to protect the peoples  particularly the smaller countries  from harm. In fact  what they desire is to put them under their own ""umbrella"" and to embrace them in order to suffocate them. All this ""concern"" shows that the big Powers are afraid of the small countries  hence each of them seeks to paralyse the militant energies of the peoples of these countries  to lead them astray from their just struggle  to set one against the other. But the great Powers are bound to fail; for the times when the small nations used to be impressed by myths and empires are gone. Peoples are masters of their own destinies. They will never accept chains  but will break them once and for all.159.	They attack Socialist Albania because it speaks the truth. It is true that we are small in number  but we are not afraid of the attacks of the enemies  for we know that today the true words of a small people are listened to with sympathy and respect by all honest men and the peoples of the world. The strength of small peoples lies in their militant spiritual unity with all the peoples fighting for their rights without sinking into intrigues  in their determination to carry through to the end their struggle for the fulfilment of their aspirations  against the aims of the imperialists and the revisionists.160.	In recent years many events have taken place which demonstrate that the so-called detente is a slogan invented and spread with the purpose of misleading the peoples  creating illusions that  in the world today  the chances of establishing peace and calm are allegedly greater than the dangers of war.161.	For years on end whole speeches from the rostrum of this Assembly have been devoted to the praise of ""detente"". But what is the real situation? The world has never been at peace. What we see in the world is not detente  but aggravation of contradictions  increasing conflicts and rising dangers of war. Not a single session of the United Nations General Assembly has been held without some grave crisis or a hotbed of war somewhere in the world created by the interference of the imperialist Powers. The so-called detente is but an aspect of the relations between the two super-Powers at various stages of bargaining between them. But bargaining between the imperialist Powers can in no way be considered as easing of tension. It is a source of danger for the peoples  and for international peace and security.162.	For some time the Helsinki Conference on so-called ""European security"" has been presented as a model of detente. But  just as expected  the Helsinki Conference brought no good to Europe. Not a single positive change has taken place on this continent. Nothing has changed in the policies  the designs or the practices of the United States and the Soviet Union; on the contrary  the two super-Powers have intensified their efforts to strengthen their positions in their respective zones of influence and to challenge each other. Now it can be said with greater assurance than ever that even the decisions adopted at Helsinki have remained dead letters. The fiasco of the Helsinki Conference is evident also from the fact that the two sides are reduced to hurling accusations at one another for non-observance of the commitments entered into with so much ado in the Final Act of the Conference. One cannot but be surprised at the political actions of a Government which seeks to broaden the Belgrade conference through the participation of the countries of the Mediterranean area at a time when that same Government is providing the Soviet and American fleets with innumerable facilities in the ports of its own country.163.	The Albanian delegation states once again that for real steps towards true European security to be taken the first step must be to liquidate the aggressive military blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty  to compel the United States and Soviet troops to withdraw from the territories of European countries  to dismantle their military bases and to prohibit their military manoeuvres in the vicinity of the borders of the European countries.164.	In the Balkan Peninsula  the situation is such as to give no grounds for satisfaction either. The two imperialist super-Powers are renewing their attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the States of this area. The peoples of the Balkans  who have suffered much from the games of the big Powers  regard those actions with legitimate concern and demand that the interference of United States imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism in their internal affairs be stopped  that they be deprived of the possibility of using the Balkan States  as their instruments  against one another  or of using the territory of a Balkan State as a bridge-head for the realization of their aggressive plans.165.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has spared no efforts to contribute to the cause of peace and security in the Balkans. More than once it has declared—and this it has borne out with facts—that never  and in no way  will the slightest evil come to neighbouring countries through its territory. We uphold the opinion that in the present situation the aspirations of the peoples of this area can be served better through the development of bilateral relations.166.	The continuing tension in Cyprus and the complications deriving from this situation are instigated and utilized by the two imperialist super-Powers for their intentions and interests. As always  the Albanian Government is of the opinion that a just solution to the Cyprus problem must be found by the interested parties  allowing no interference whatsoever by the imperialist Powers  and in compliance with the sovereign rights of the Cypriot people and the interests of the two communities living on the island.167.	The peoples of the Mediterranean countries have many proofs to convince them that their aspirations to turn the Mediterranean into a sea of peace and tranquillity cannot be realized as long as the aggressive military fleets of the two super-Powers stay in that area. Therefore  a determined effort must be made to compel the United States of America and the Soviet Union to withdraw their fleets from the Mediterranean  and to refrain from providing anchorage or support bases for these fleets. For tranquillity and understanding to be established in the Mediterranean  every Mediterranean country must refuse to play the game of the two super-Powers in this area.168.	In the Middle East  the two super-Powers are becoming ever more embroiled in their interests  and are resorting to all means  wiles and intrigues in order to preserve their present positions and to penetrate deeper into this strategic area so rich in oil. With the powerful support of the United States of America  Israel continues to keep the Arab territories under its occupation and is becoming ever more intransigent. While the Soviet Union feigns to give support to the Arabs  it is really trying to deceive the world for  in fact  it is backing Israel and its aggressive policy in various ways.169.	It is clear that the plans of the imperialist Powers  such as the ""step-by-step"" solutions  the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  or the creation of a Palestinian mini-State  are nothing. but dangerous manoeuvres prejudicial to the Arab peoples. These are meant to trample underfoot the rights of these peoples  to fan quarrels and divisions among them  to put down the just struggle of the Palestinian people and to liquidate their cause.170.	The Arab peoples are seeing ever more clearly that the Middle East crisis cannot be solved by the United States imperialists or the Soviet social-imperialists  who have provoked it and who keep it ablaze  and that their just cause- will triumph by their relying not on the super-Powers  but on their own determined straggle   on the strengthening of their unity.171.	The Albanian people  who have been and will always be on the side of the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the other fraternal Arab peoples  are convinced that these peoples  with so glorious a tradition  will in the end emerge victorious from the protracted struggle against their numerous enemies.172.	The peoples of Zimbabwe  Azania  and Namibia have intensified their just liberation struggle against the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury  which are propped up by the United States of America and the other imperialist Powers.173.	The Albanian Government supports the just struggle of the peoples of Azania  Zimbabwe and Namibia and of the other African countries against the racist regimes  against apartheid and racial discrimination  against neo-colonialism and the brutal interference of the two superpowers. It firmly condemns the policy of savage oppression and exploitation practised by the racist regimes in Africa. It also condemns the armed provocations of these regimes against the neighbouring States. The struggle of the African peoples enjoys the powerful solidarity and support of all the peoples of the world; it is a just struggle and it will triumph.174.	The Korean peninsula has been and remains a centre of tension and a danger to peace and security in Asia because of the aggressive policy of United States imperialism and the presence of its troops in South Korea. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always supported and continues to support the just struggle of the Korean people against United States imperialism and its instruments  and for the independent unification of the homeland.175.	The United Nations has been dealing with the question of disarmament for a long time  and quite a few resolutions have been adopted. Notwithstanding frequent talks  both overt and covert  and despite innumerable resolutions on disarmament  the armaments race is continuing at an ever more feverish pace and the two super-Powers are manufacturing more lethal weapons. The war budgets have been inflated as never before. Arms trade has assumed unprecedented proportions.176.	The Albanian delegation holds that the demagogic propaganda on disarmament  which the two super-Powers are conducting  must be exposed in the eyes of international public opinion. Imperialism and social-imperialism do not even think of disarmament. On the contrary  they are seeking to have a recognized right to uncontrolled and unlimited arming and uninterrupted perfecting of their weapons of mass extermination. They are trying to disarm others while preserving and increasing their stockpiles of weapons in order to bring permanent pressure to bear on peoples.177.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania is building socialism successfully and is forging ahead  firmly trusting in the principle of self-reliance. While Albania has received and may still receive some internationalist aid from a socialist country  this aid is by no means decisive for the fate of the socialist construction of the country and in no circumstance whatsoever can it become a cause for infringement of the independence and sovereignty of our country. Never before  and even less so today  has the People's Socialist Republic of Albania based its existence  freedom  independence and sovereignty on others. Albania has enshrined in its Constitution the fact that it desires to have political  economic and cultural relations with various States on the basis of equality  respect of sovereignty  non-interference in each other's internal affairs and mutual benefit.178.	We do not stand for autarky and have a correct idea of what commercial relations among various countries should be. Those relations must be correct  equal and mutually beneficial  according to the ""give-and-take"" principle. We will be for trade with all those who want to develop trade relations with us. Of course  we do not base the development of our socialist economy on foreign trade  but on the all-round development of industry and agriculture  relying mainly on our own forces; therefore  the fact that we engage in trade with other countries by no means implies that the People's Socialist Republic of Albania is dependent on anybody.179.	We will also promote cultural relations with other countries  in compliance with the principles and norms defined by our country  provided they are acceptable to the other party  too. We will maintain such relations with those States which wish us well  in fields such as the exchange of literature.  artistic presentations  films and the like. We should like cultural and artistic activities of other countries that take place in Albania to have a progressive  freedom- loving and popular spirit. There is no doubt that we have welcomed and will continue to welcome such activities with pleasure because they are a suitable means of communication and strengthening of friendship with various peoples and countries of the world.180.	The foreign policy of socialist Albania has been and is a correct  principled  above-board and consistent policy  the independent policy of a free and sovereign country. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has not traded on principles and will never do so. The imperialists  'he social-imperialists and the other reactionaries are in vain to spread diabolic slanders about Albania; they are trying to create the impression that  under the pressure of international events  Albania will be compelled either to choose isolation and separation from the world or abandon the road it has been following to date. We declare openly and not in diplomatic terms that nobody should cherish illusions that ""Albania is not an isolated country""  that ""it cannot live without foreign aid""  or that ""it will be compelled to stretch out a begging hand to anybody"".181.	The imperialist Powers must entertain no illusions about that nor must they follow their ambition of imposing their will on socialist Albania. Nobody can impose his will on Albania; it does not threaten anybody  nor does it allow anybody to threaten it. It will successfully oppose any aggressor that may dare to violate its sacred borders. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania lives and will live on free  independent and enjoying full national sovereignty.182.	Albania is a fully independent country; it has long ago denounced the Warsaw Treaty and will never have military alliances with any State. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania and its armed people will always successfully guarantee the defence of the freedom  national independence and territorial integrity of the country  because the policy of socialist Albania is a correct unequivocal policy opposed to any form of aggression  rapacious war  diktat to hegemony  tutelage or colonial exploitation  national oppression or racial discrimination. Albania has taken every measure to cope with any danger successfully. It will stand rock-firm  in the first place because its people are led by a strong and truly Marxist-Leninist party and because there is unbreakable unity between the Party and the people. Under the leadership of the Labour Party  with Comrade Enver Hoxha at its head  our people are successfully building socialism and vigilantly defending the victories achieved.183.	In conclusion  the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania wants to point out that it will never fail to make its modest contribution to the discussion of the questions on the agenda of this session.

"4",161,"ARE",32,1977,"﻿112.	Mr. President  I have much pleasure  first of all  in extending to you my delegation's congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your election to this post reflects the high  regard and respect in which Yugoslavia is universally held  especially by the non-aligned countries  for the pioneering and leading role it has played in the creation and consolidation of the non-aligned group and for its efforts to strengthen the foundations of world peace and security based on the principles of equality and justice. This election also reflects our appreciation of your own impressive record in the fields of law  journalism  foreign policy and diplomacy.113.	I am also happy to express  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  our deep gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe  who presided over the previous session with such admirable ability and distinction. His presidency of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea continues to evoke our appreciation and admiration.114.	The Government of the United Arab Emirates highly appreciates the untiring efforts of Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  to attain the objectives and purposes of the United Nations Charter  in the forefront of which is the maintenance of international peace and security.115.	We observe with great satisfaction the increasing acceptance of the principle of universality of our Organization  as demonstrated by the admission of new Member States. On this occasion my delegation is happy to extend its warmest congratulations to the sister Republic of Djibouti on its admission to membership in our international Organization. The Republic of Djibouti has already joined our Arab family and we have declared more than once that we are prepared to do whatever we can to help that young Republic  following the attainment of its political independence  to deal with the difficulties and obstacles which face it at the present stage. I am also pleased to extend our congratulations to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on its admission to membership in the United Nations and to wish its people  who have suffered long from war and division  all prosperity and progress.116.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [Aj'32/1 / during the preceding year gives rise to both our concern and our optimism. It gives rise to our concern because it objectively underlines the magnitude of the difficulties and challenges facing our Organization in its efforts to preserve the peace and security of mankind. On the other hand  it gives us reason for optimism because it clearly emphasizes a fact that we should all recognize  namely the determination of our international Organization to spare no effort to solve those complex international problems  the persistence of which could jeopardize world peace and security  thereby undermining the whole structure of the United Nations itself.117.	Since its inception the United Arab Emirates has followed with deep concern the developments in South Africa  Zimbabwe and Namibia because we are fully aware of the dangers inherent in the perpetuation of white minority rule in those African territories. We have strongly condemned the policy of apartheid practised by the racist Government of South Africa for that policy represents a flagrant denial of the most fundamental human rights and constitutes a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations.118.	Proceeding from this firm belief  the United Arab Emirates has acceded to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and to the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in all its Forms. In addition  we have never hesitated to extend material and moral support to our sister countries and to the African liberation movements in their struggle to restore the dignity of their peoples and recover their peoples' sovereignty over their national soil.119.	We have-confirmed this support in a positive and effective manner on several occasions  the last of which was the First Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States  held in Cairo in March of this year.120.	In this connexion  it should be said that we have noted with satisfaction the increased isolation imposed by the international community on the two racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia. During the last few months intensified efforts have been made  particularly by some major Powers  to achieve a peaceful solution to this problem based on the recognition of the right of the black majority to administer their own countries  with a view to sparing the African continent the havoc of war and bloodshed.121.	While supporting the current efforts to achieve a peaceful solution of this problem  we still believe that the racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia are determined to persist in their intransigent attitude. Therefore it is necessary to adopt further practical and effective measures  especially on the part of the major Powers  to ensure the compliance of these racist regimes with the wishes of the international community. More assistance should also be made available to the African liberation movements to help them meet this racist challenge.122.	While international efforts are being mobilized to settle the issues of Namibia and Zimbabwe on a peaceful basis  important developments are taking place in the search for a peaceful solution of the problems of Palestine and the Middle East.123.	It is now universally accepted that the settlement of these problems cannot be achieved except on the basis of the exercise by the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and Palestine of their right to -self-determination  independence and national sovereignty. This unanimity  however  is challenged by Vorster in respect of Namibia  by Ian Smith in respect of Zimbabwe and by Begin in respect of Palestine.124.	It is not necessary for me to reiterate that the issue of Palestine is the core and essence of the problem of theMiddle East  as well as all the related problems  some of which are included in the agenda of the General Assembly. The international community has recognized this fact in various resolutions  statements and declarations adopted by various institutions  organizations and meetings  both at governmental and non-governmental levels  unilaterally  bilaterally and multilaterally. The international community  with the exception of Israel and a few of its supporters  has recognized that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.125.	Bearing all this in mind  how could anyone  including Israel  conceive of  or even consider  the possibility of a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict without a solution of the Palestine problem and without the participation of the Palestinian people through their genuine and legitimate representative in the peace-making process?126.	The refusal of Israel to recognize this fact leads us to conclude that Israel does not really wish to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict  nor does it want the establishment of peace and security in the Middle East.127.	This conclusion is obvious to anyone who has any knowledge of the Zionist doctrine and is aware of its purposes and follows the implementation of its programmes in Palestine. This leads us to a fundamental principle in the Zionist strategy  namely  that the perpetuation of a state of tension and strife is the best guarantee for the consolidation and expansion of Israel  since it galvanizes material and moral support of the Jewish community in the world and therefore the establishment of the Zionist entity on Palestinian territory.128.	There is enough evidence to support this conclusion in the recent measures taken by the Government of Menachem Begin to set up settlements and to apply Israeli laws to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Such measures are obviously designed to integrate those areas within Israel.129.	Israel is fully aware that these measures have been condemned and rejected not only by the Arabs but by the whole international community  as has been manifested in the various statements and declarations made by different States and organizations  including some made by those who are known to be supporters of Israel. However  those States should not content themselves with a condemnation of such measures but should rather seriously reconsider their military and financial aid to Israel  for without such aid Israel could never persist in its expansionist policies. Although Israel is well aware of these facts  it still pursues its aims of annexing Arab territories  with the consequent frustration of all peace efforts and the prolongation of the state of tension and conflict in our region.130.	We fully appreciate the statements made by those in the highest positions of responsibility in the Governments of certain major Powers condemning those measures as obstacles to peace. We hope that such statements will be translated into specific actions in accordance with the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention reactive to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 12 a convention to which Israel is a party. Under article II  all the States parties to the Convention are enjoined not only to observe and implement its provisions but also to ensure that other States parties do likewise.131.	Considering Israel's refusal to observe and implement the provisions of the Convention  and since the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories is dependent on the financial assistance extended by those States and by the Zionist organizations located within their territory  we wish to call upon the responsible authorities in those States to take appropriate measures to withhold military  financial and other forms of assistance to Israel. This is an obligation they have accepted as signatories of the fourth Geneva Convention. Such measures will- lend credence to their policy statements; otherwise these statements and declarations will be nothing more than empty words.132.	It is indeed regrettable that the question of Cyprus remains without a solution' that could bring a just and permanent peace to the people of the island. The Secretary-General has indicated to us in his report on the work of the Organization that progress so far has been slow and disappointing. Faced with that fact  we cannot but repeat our appeal to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldehim  to continue his efforts  which we fully appreciate  in order to reach a settlement that will ensure the peaceful coexistence of the Greek and Turkish communities within a federal system protecting the interests of both sides and guaranteeing the island's territorial integrity and non-alignment.133.	The issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte is another of the urgent matters included in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly considered this question at its previous session and adopted resolution 31/4 affirming that the island of Mayotte was an integral part of the Comoros. On 18 October 1976 our representative affirmed that the continuation of the island of Mayotte outside the national sovereignty of the Comoros was a matter of concern for most States  especially Arab and African States  which maintain strong relations of friendship and co-operation with France. We still hope that the issue will be resolved in a manner that will ensure the territorial integrity of the Comoro islands and will maintain the strong ties of friendship which exist between France and the Arab and African States.134.	The failure to achieve any substantial progress on the question of disarmament is a matter of concern to us. The arms race and-the proliferation of lethal weapons  whether nuclear or otherwise  is a heavy burden on humanity and endangers international peace and security. We therefore believe that it is essential to take practical and concrete steps for the reduction of military budgets and the transfer of human and material resources from disarmament to the fields of development where they are most urgently needed. We are indeed hopeful that the special session of the General Assembly which will be convened next year for this purpose will take positive steps in that direction.135.	The United Arab Emirates has  since its independence  supported the General Assembly resolution declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace /resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We support all measures and steps designed to give effect to that declaration. We spare no sincere effort to promote and strengthen co-operation among the Gulf States  with a view to guaranteeing the security and stability of our region. We have always called and will continue to call for the solution of existing or future disputes among States of our region by peaceful means and without any foreign intervention. This position is dictated by our firm belief in the need to keep our region far removed from the conflicts among the major Powers.136.	Our region has witnessed intense efforts during the past few years  and the General Assembly through its regular and special sessions has adopted several resolutions aimed at bridging the gap between the developed industrial nations and the developing countries and at establishing a new international economic order based on justice and on more equitable economic relations which would ensure rapid progress for the developing countries and the improvement of the standards of living of their peoples.137.	Then came the initiative of the President of the French Republic for the convening of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation  which was attended by both industrially developed countries and developing countries. However  after 18 months of intensive negotiation  the Conference failed to achieve any results and merely recommended that the dialogue on unresolved issues should be continued within the United Nations system and other related bodies. The resumption of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly helped to underline the commitment of the developing countries to establish a new international economic order  in spite of the disappointment brought about by the failure of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation. However  the resumed session of the General Assembly also failed to produce tangible results.138.	We believe that political security is closely linked with economic stability and that there can be no real political security as long as urgent and dangerous issues remain unresolved. The terms of trade continue to deteriorate to the detriment of the developing countries. This has led to the rise of their indebtedness with the consequent increase of their heavy burden of debt. Those countries are thus obliged to allocate a high proportion of their export earnings to service those debts at the expense of their basic imports from the industrialized countries. At the same time  the prices of primary commodities exported from developing countries to industrial countries continue to deteriorate with the resulting aggravation of their balance of payments.139.	The agenda of this session of the General Assembly includes a most important item  namely  the one relating to the North-South dialogue. We believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for the continuation of that dialogue. In spite of the failure of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to produce definite results  we still believe that it has clearly defined the issues. The forthcoming debates will be difficult and strenuous  but they will be a necessary step towards the consolidation of international economic co-operation.140.	Political determination will lead to new conditions that will consequently pave the way to the establishment of a new international economic order based on the interdependence and solidarity of all States  developed and developing.141.	The United Arab Emirates  itself a developing country  belongs to the third world and to the group of non-aligned countries. It has contributed and will continue to contribute to any international co-operative effort  inspired by its deep faith in the principles of the United Nations Charter and its fundamental aim of promoting human welfare and establishing an international economic order based on justice and equality.

"5",208,"ARG",32,1977,"﻿190.	Mr. President  let me first congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Government of Argentina on your unanimous election to the presidency of this General Assembly. This lofty distinction is a deserved recognition of your human and professional qualities and of your profound knowledge of the problems debated in this Organization. We are certain that under your serene guidance our work will be crowned with success. We wish to assure you now of the full co-operation of the delegation of Argentina.191.	You are a prominent citizen of a country with which Argentina maintains the most cordial ties of friendship and understanding. On the basis of mutual respect for our national identities  in the course of the years we have cemented positive relations at both the bilateral and multilateral levels. In the latter  I am most happy to mention the constructive role which Yugoslavia plays in the movement of non-aligned countries  in its striving for genuinely balanced positions consistent with the tenets which led to its creation.192.	I would also avail myself of this opportunity to place on record our gratitude to Mr. Hamfston Shirley Amerainghe of Sri Lanka for his productive and wise actions in guiding the intense labours of the last session.193.	We continue to believe that the goal of universality must be achieved. Consistent with that unalterable principle  we greet and welcome today in this hall the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which now join our Organization; and to Papua-New Guinea and Angola  who became Members last year  we extend our best wishes for prosperity.194.	As we infer from the contents of the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the United Nations  the events registered since the last general debate do not allow for an unduly sanguine assessment of the world situation. International peace and security  the maintenance of which is still the primary responsibility of the United Nations  have again been threatened by a renewal of tensions in some of the political processes which are of concern to all of us.195.	Within the world picture  which is not very encouraging  I should like to emphasize here  because of the contrast it represents  an event that is positive from every point of view  an event that is an important milestone in inter-American relations. I am referring to the conclusion of the Panama Canal Treaties that was signed on 7 September 1977 in the presence of the majority of the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Americas. Argentina  whose first priority in its foreign policy is directed toward Latin America  within which it is firmly integrated  was represented at that solemn ceremony by its President so as to highlight in the most eloquent manner possible its enthusiasm  support for and satisfaction with the happy outcome of this ancient injustice.196.	Panama and the United States have tangibly shown  with clear perception of reality  that a conflict can be solved peacefully and adequately through negotiations  provided the necessary political determination and goodwill exist between the parties. Dialogue and co-operation prevailing over confrontation have thus removed an obstacle which hindered continental friendship.197.	My country has had to endure the curtailment of its territorial integrity for almost a century and a half  and it sincerely hopes that the United Kingdom will follow the example set by the United States. We are convinced that  with the same political will  we can also arrive at a satisfactory solution to the dispute regarding sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas  thus putting an end to one of the last vestiges of colonialism in America.198.	In compliance with resolution 31/49  adopted by the General Assembly in 1976  which ratifies prior pronouncements and clearly sets forth the position of the United Nations on this dispute  we have again gone to a negotiating table with the United Kingdom. We have done so in good faith and with the firm intention of advancing along this course  but without losing sight of the legitimate rights which support our claim. During November we shall have another meeting and shall report on its results in due course. We wish to reiterate once again our hope that theUnited Kingdom will realize the opportunities and perspectives that a just solution to the problem would unlock.199.	Argentina  through me  wishes to place on record its gratitude to this General Assembly for its full understanding of the problem  as evidenced in successive resolutions  and for the solidarity we have received in the voting of the overwhelming majority of its Member States. On this occasion  I particularly wish to mention the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which was responsible for drafting the principles applicable to decolonization and seeing to it that they were in keeping with the particular characteristics of each case.200.	The first talks among Brazil  Paraguay and the Argentine Republic to harmonize the interests and rights of the three countries with regard to the utilization of the resources of the Upper Parana may constitute an important chapter for understanding among States which share the same natural resource  further demonstrating that dialogue and co-operation are the appropriate means in relations in Latin America.201.	The Argentine Republic has traditionally defended the utilization of shared natural resources on a rational basis and with lasting understandings  allowing for conciliation of the objectives and needs of all the countries concerned.202.	The international community has already taken significant steps for the elaboration of suitable guidelines regarding the utilization of these resources embodying principles to cement harmonious coexistence among nations. It is therefore the responsibility of our Governments to base that co-operation upon practical and reasonable norms  including also in that process all the useful experience gained up to the present time.203.	Among the critical areas which require most attention in this General Assembly there is no denying that the Middle East question must be in the forefront. This is so because  as we have repeatedly pointed out in this forum  in that region there is a series of dangerous circumstances which  if not promptly faced up to  can transform the scaffolding of a precarious truce-one which was not easily obtained-into another armed confrontation of unforeseeable consequences. Indeed it is disquieting to note that  despite the efforts made to smooth out the obstacles on the way to peace  intransigent attitudes persist which do not meet the aspirations of the international community nor the specific recommendations of the United Nations.204.	My Government believes that the most tangible contribution that the parties involved in the conflict can make at this time  if they seriously desire a just and lasting peace  is to put an end to or refrain from carrying out any act which could directly or indirectly mean an impediment to negotiations.205.	Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) constitute a viable point of departure for reaching that goal. The balanced set of reciprocal rights and duties they contain can be supplemented with all the other elements which flow from the prevailing situation in the Middle East.206.	But however adequate those texts might be  they will remain a mere dead letter-in this case too-in the absence of the determination to proceed with flexibility and a constructive spirit so as to make it easier to bring about the beginning of an understanding. Those who adhere to rigid positions  trying to overlook the facts around them  and who aspire to the consolidation of transitory territorial conquests by means of measures that have been condemned even by their allies are conspiring against their own interests by postponing and making more difficult an integral solution to the crisis.207.	The Argentine Republic  now as always  sincerely wishes a swift solution of the Middle East problem. This wish is not of recent date nor is it founded on fluctuating strategic factors  or on speculations on economic facts which have become important lately. Likewise  it goes beyond the natural obligation we have as a Member of the United Nations to promote ways and means for a peaceful solution. This wish is prompted by intimate and fundamental reasons bearing on the substantial human contributions of Arab and Jewish origin which have been integrated with the large flows of immigration of our people. They have a major share in the formation of our national being.208.	Because of this and because we can show an experience with a wealth of positive aspects  sustained by the harmonious social togetherness of Argentines of different creeds and races  we would be able to offer our goodwill to solve this agonizing conflict. The friendly relations which we maintain equally with the Arab States and with Israel enable us to grasp the avid desire for peace and progress felt by both.209.	The Argentine Government considers that now  before it is too late  the Geneva Peace Conference should be convened so that negotiations might be started there which would lead to definite peace. We urge the Arabs and the Israelis  with all due respect for their respective positions  to rise above circumstantial objections so as to make that meeting possible and  together  take the first steps towards co-operation in the Middle East.210.	In southern Africa the situation is not encouraging either. Rhodesia  Namibia and the consequences of the practice of apartheid have brought that important region to a critical' point where any delay might prevent suitable arrangements within the framework of the Charter.211.	In this matter  as in others  United Nations action has anticipated events and their consequences. We said a year ago that our Organization not only was sensitive to changes but had in many cases also carried them resolutely forward and legitimized their existence.11 The example we mentioned then was decolonization  because it was in this field that our Organization created a body of doctrine which gave an impetus to the accession to independence of a goodly number of dependent territories which are now sovereign nations. But this is no less true in the problem weare analyzing. The United Nations has in many instances charted the course for meeting the legitimate aspirations of peoples who still await their independence.212.	With the African continent we share an ocean which is the only outlet for our economic potential. It is therefore an objective of our foreign policy to keep it free of any conflict. It goes without saying  then  that we can never remain indifferent to what happens in Africa. It was in this spirit that Argentina participated fully at the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Nigeria in August. We are very pleased with the propitious climate that prevailed in its deliberations - and which made possible the adoption of a final Declaration by consensus.213.	The imperative need to halt and reverse the direction of the arms race reflects the express demand of all the peoples of the world. The great Powers  which have the monopoly and responsibility of destructive power  must undertake the unavoidable task of discharging their responsibilities towards the international community. To try to shift that responsibility to medium-sized or small States  whose basic security and defence needs must be clearly accepted  would only have the effect of feeding the suspicion that the world's attention is being distracted with side issues in order to avert the adoption of measures in the priority field of nuclear disarmament.214.	The eighth special session of the General Assembly will provide both a forum and an opportunity that are unique  thus allowing the will of Governments to be unequivocally expressed in peremptory terms. For the first time the United Nations  so broadly representative of the world situation with its 149 Members  will hold a session with the sole objective of examining in depth and debating all items related to disarmament. It will face the difficult but stimulating challenge of establishing new guidelines and priorities for future negotiations.215.	Argentina received the great distinction of presiding over the preparatory work for that special session. We accepted that post with full awareness of all the efforts involved in carrying out that mandate. Now we should like to confirm our most resolute determination to continue to co-operate with the countries present here so that the special session is given in advance the best guarantees and possibilities for success.216.	The Argentine Government is deeply concerned about two major questions  respecting which  it is painful to note  certain methods have failed to bring about understanding; on the contrary  there are even various forms of confrontation or disagreement.217.	These two items are human rights and economic co-operation. They are set forth in the Charter of our Organization because the world community was conscious of the fact that  to sustain them  the United Nations could be content with playing a preventive role  but must also encourage States to co-operate in developing both principles  so as to ensure respect for human rights and satisfaction of man's most basic needs.218.	For the first of these items  human rights  there is one approach which is not in accord with reality  as it prefers to dwell on imprecise denunciations of violations while ignoring the phenomenon which is more typically an affront to human rights and  at the same time  is invariably the source of their violations: terrorism.219.	Although there are isolated voices that warn us and alert us about this scourge  others choose to make little of it because of political affinities or from naiveté. The favourite argument is to describe terrorist acts as mere political or common crimes.220.	In fact  these are illegal acts which can in no case be defined as common crimes  because of the political motives involved  and do not fit within the traditional limits of political crimes because of their brutality. This is a freak crime  a crime against humanity  a crime of terrorism which  while it shares some of the features of political and common crimes  goes far beyond the boundaries of those crimes.221.	News reports inform us almost daily about new crimes  hijackings and assaults committed by terrorists. My predecessor  who addressed the Assembly from this rostrum a year ago  was the victim of a criminal attack which brought him to the brink of death. There is no end to the list  and in almost every case we would find that terrorism is the common element in those tragic events of our times.222.	Within this context  I shall  by your leave  quote what the Secretary-General said in a message addressed to the United Nations Correspondents Association on 15 September  because it reflects with striking acumen a view which my country fully shares on this subject: There is another phenomenon of our times which is now assuming sinister proportions... I refer to the increase of criminal terrorism. Some of the most pernicious examples of this form of violence appear to have their origins not in acute poverty or in physical or spiritual deprivation  but rather in .. sections of human society where a mixture of affluence  permissiveness and self-disgust has generated a ruthless and destructive arrogance .... There is widespread controversy over the roots of this social and political disease. ... Whatever its origins  I believe that this problem is grave enough and has sufficient potential international implications to be discussed most seriously among the Members of the United Nations. That is an accurate description of the facts.223.	Even today  when terrorist subversion is definitely receding  Argentina bears the scars of its evil actions. There still remain isolated extremist groups ready to spread terror and some of them  fleeing from justice  surface in the major capitals of Europe  where police organizations uncover their clandestine hide-outs and their attempts to obtain additional funds by criminal means.224.	Terrorism is not of one kind for a given nation or region of the world. Terrorism is the expression of a vast conspiracy which selects a country as an experimental field  to isolate it from the rest of the international community and to destroy its social and economic structure by means of its usual tactics of intimidation. Terrorist groups  using as their shield an alleged campaign for the defence of human rights  resort to deliberate accusations so as to make those countries appear to be violating those rights. It is a bitter irony that this arbitrary campaign has been given more attention in some international sectors than the repeated manifestations of terrorist violence.225.	The concept of human rights violations is the object in our days of a distortion which places it beyond the bounds of realism. Let us recall that according to the internationally accepted definition  violations of human rights occur when there is a persistent and systematic pattern  following a deliberate policy.226.	When we laid the structure for the international system  the violation of a human right could be foreseen only as an act committed by one wielding political power  that is  as an act of a Government to the detriment of those governed; whereas today new realities and new pressure factors are in operation  embodied mainly in the international subversive groups  which warrant our speaking of a modern form of human rights violation and compel us to recognize that none of the instruments provided for in the international system cover this new type of violation.227.	Failure to understand this changed set of circumstances has meant a partial facing of the problem and  accordingly  that its approach is still exclusively centered on government acts while overlooking the fact that the sole source of this violence comes from terrorist cells which  by their destructive actions  bring into question not only the effectiveness of individual guarantees but the very survival of man.228.	It is for that reason that the peoples  through their Governments  must be able to exercise the legitimate right of self-defence when confronted with the aggression of terrorism  without pressures aimed at limiting their sovereignty.229.	As a positive response to the Secretary-General's appeal  the Argentine Government is determined to cooperate fully in any initiative which takes into account the real situation and counters the existence of terrorism with an effective action of solidarity. We appeal to the rest of the international community to proceed likewise and to lend a helping hand to the countries affected so as to make it possible to return to the genuine and full enjoyment of individual guarantees and freedoms.230.	We said that the second item in regard to which our Organization seems to encounter barriers that are difficult to scale is the one bearing on international economic co-operation. Irrefutable proof of this is to be found in the meagre results obtained at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  which  during the last 18 months focused negotiations on the international economic area. The Conference did not attain its objectives nor did it live up to the expectations placed in it by its participants  who sought to bring about the structural changes needed for the present context of international economic relations.231.. These relations are characterized by profound imbalances. Inflation  the crisis in the balance-of-payments  the spectacular rise in external indebtedness  massive unemployment in the industrialized countries  the slowdown in the economic growth-rate everywhere  monetary disarray  all these are but the symptoms of causes which have been at work throughout the last decades.232.	There are numerous areas through which a policy of international co-operation can be directed. A particularly appropriate field in which this can be implemented is that connected with the integration of developing countries which have the following distinctive features shared by all of them: too little and the wrong kind of geographical integration within their countries and between them and other neighbouring territories under a different political sovereignty; too little and the wrong kind of involvement of broad social groups in the training required to assimilate and recreate the knowledge generated by scientific progress; and too little and the wrong kind of integration of spearhead technology into their economic structures.233.	All of this weakens subregional or regional integration processes  mutilates their growth potential and makes it difficult to adjust their economies to the rhythm and needs of world economic evolution.234.	In the past the predominant concerns of our Organization were linked to problems among the highly industrialized countries  or between them and the developing ones. Present circumstances have made it necessary to negotiate on a third front by exploring the ways and means of effecting the integration of and between developing countries  the impact of this development on the industrialized Powers and their participation in the attainment of these objectives.235.	This new development in international economic co-operation  which is based on the interaction of individual and collective efforts by the developing countries among themselves  has been endorsed by our Organization and constitutes one of the most dynamic fields in the process of change aimed at bringing about the reordering of the international economic order in which the members of the international community are engaged.236.	The initiative of Argentina in the field of horizontal technical co-operation is well known. We come to this Assembly with new concerns about finding  in co-operation with all  the kinds of mechanisms and institutional machinery which will give fresh impetus to the integration of the developing world.237.	As a consequence of this  there is an urgent need for the developing countries to determine among themselves  by regions or subregions  areas of economic preferences which  together with physical integration and a programme for the integration of human resources  will make it possible for these countries to join the mainstream of world economy.238.	Many key problems of food  population and politics  would change substantially in kind and magnitude if the developing countries could rely on suitable plans and the essential financial means to undertake a policy of massive integration of their human resources which would be capable of building high-efficiency productive structures.239.	The highly industrialized countries and the creditor countries must realize that here is an opportunity of the very first order to channel surplus resources to the developing countries. This must be acknowledged to be a realistic policy since it is designed to ensure their own future prosperity through the growth of other nations.240.	Setting up restrictive rules to technological pluralism would constitute an irritating injustice by the most powerful and affluent countries  going against those who are struggling in difficult circumstances to rise above the formidable obstacles to their development.241.	We wish to emphasize that the search by the developing countries for appropriate  unorthodox integration formulas must of necessity be considered by the international community with all the seriousness it deserves  and these formulas must needs be accepted on a par with the classical ones  as exceptions to the universal principle of the most-favoured-nation clause.242.	We believe that a wide-ranging and open dialogue between multinational integration groups and GATT might not only yield reciprocal benefits but also abundantly enrich the norms of that international organization.243.	We also wish that in the countries which generate and supply spearhead technology the political will might emerge to enable access to that technology by the developing countries  by means of clear  fair and egalitarian international rules.244.	Financial support is also needed for integration in order to attain the objectives set. The magnitude of existing financial surpluses leads us to hope that it will be possible to establish a flow of funds to finance the form of co-operation advocated.245.	We believe it to be important  therefore  for the international community to undertake a study of existing mechanisms and institutions  so that they may smoothly link these new funds with projects for integration. These institutions are already rendering signal service  but the magnitude of the resources needed for integration will require specialized treatment  of a different conception.246.	The Argentine Government feels authorized to request wide support from the international community for the concept it advocates because it is prepared to assume the new responsibilities  which would be its share among those which it accepts in the context of international economic co-operation  and in particular as regards the relatively least developed countries. Furthermore  it does so backed by the results of its own efforts which enabled it to surmount  in a little more than a year  the gravest and most difficult economic stage in its history. It is clearly aware of the problems which remain to be solved  but it is confident of final success because it is assisted by the understanding and sacrifice of the Argentinean people.247.	This irrevocable attitude bears witness once again to the high value we attach to the universality of the United Nations as an Organization open to the contributions of all but  likewise  where exclusions are inconceivable. Accordingly  we cannot fail to register our apprehension—a feeling shared by Latin America—at a trend which in fact makes for the progressive alienation of countries of intermediate growth from important mechanisms of international co-operation. This approach  which seems to penalize the fruits of the efforts if not the sacrifices of our people  cannot but count on our most categorical rebuff.248.	We believe that position to be- shared by the developing countries as a whole. It is not by chance that the bases of a more fruitful and systematic technical and economic co-operation among them are being set up. That  inter alia  will promote a constructive and meaningful integration.249.	The Government I represent is proud that Argentina was chosen as host to the first United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  to be held in Buenos Aires in March and April 1978. As at the beginning of this year  for what was also the first United Nations Water Conference  my Government offers its liberal hospitality to all the participants at that new gathering and is pleased to welcome representatives most cordially and assure them of its closest co-operation towards success.

"6",313,"AUS",32,1977,"﻿30.	 Mr. President  I begin by offering you my congratulations and good wishes as you commence the task of steering the General Assembly through its thirty-second session. I have no doubt that you will serve this Assembly with distinction  and I offer you the full co-operation of my delegation. I wish to take this opportunity also to express my Government's recognition of the continuing contribution made to the United Nations by Ambassador Amerasinghe  particularly in the high office of President of the General Assembly  in which he preceded you  and in the office of President of the Third United Nations Conference on the law of the Sea. Yugoslavia has much to contribute to the functioning of the United Nations and to the furtherance of harmony among nations. Yugoslavia's distinctive role in international affairs is fittingly recognized in your election to the presidency of this General Assembly.31.	Let me also say that last year we welcomed Samoa to membership  and I am delighted and indeed honoured to be following today my friend  the Prime Minister of Samoa.32.	This year  of course  two new Members have joined us. As Chairman of the group of Western European and other States for the current month  the Australian delegation has already had an opportunity to express a welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. May I add that we look forward to full co-operation with them across the broad range of the United Nations agenda.33.	Every year we are all faced with the problem of how best to use our time on this rostrum—what subjects and themes to focus on  how wide or narrow a range of subjects to cover. I have decided to be very selective on this occasion  to speak on central issues which are of common and immediate concern to all Members and all peoples  whatever their more particular interests and preoccupations: namely  the issues of nuclear arms control and disarmament; energy; North-South relations; human rights; and the particular problems posed by the two areas of most acute crisis in the world today  southern Africa and the Middle East.34.	It has been possible during the last few years to discern a fundamental shift in emphasis in our agenda. This has been a reflection of the objective fact of a new interdependence and at the same time a much greater awareness of that fact. But there is one crucial item which is as important on the new agenda as it was on the old: the issue of nuclear arms control.35.	The first concern of mankind must be the avoidance of nuclear conflict. If we fail in that  we fail in everything. We shall no longer be living in a recognizable world  if indeed we are living at all. The issue is not one which will stand still; things must get better or they will get very much worse. And we are very close to the point of no return.36.	It is therefore enormously important and appropriate that there will be a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in 1978. This special session is not intended to provide a forum for the negotiation of new agreements. But it is intended to give new stimulus and focus to international efforts in the whole field of arms control and disarmament  to make an important contribution to a new consensus on priorities for future negotiations and to review ways in which existing negotiating machinery can be made more effective. These are urgent tasks.37.	The central issues of nuclear arms control  as I said here last year  are: the achievement of universal adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban agreement and its acceptance by all States; and continued progress by the United States and the Soviet Union in their negotiations on strategic arms limitations.38.	It is essential that the linkage between progress towards these goals be fully appreciated. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the nuclear- weapon States have undertaken to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race This obligation is one facet of a three-cornered bargain on which the non-proliferation Treaty rests: nuclear Powers undertake to negotiate towards mutual nuclear disarmament; non-nuclear Powers forswear nuclear weapons and accept safeguards on their nuclear industries; and countries in a position to do so undertake to co-operate in the peaceful development of nuclear energy. These interlocking undertakings have not only a legal aspect deriving from the Treaty but political and psychological ramifications of the greatest importance. Indeed it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of the psychological dimensions of this whole problem. The substitution of confidence for hesitation  trust for suspicion  and hope for fatalism is essential for its solution.39.	The interest of the international community is that all States should adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty. The fact that a large majority of States are now parties to the Treaty lends hope that universal adherence can be achieved. There is no other convincing test of a country's commitment to non-proliferation. Every nation has responsibilities to joining efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to contribute to an international climate which would make it harder for States to remain outside the non-proliferation Treaty.40.	Australia has always attached great importance to the cessation of nuclear testing in all environments. We are encouraged by the discussions which are taking place between the United States  the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on a comprehensive test-ban agreement. Such an agreement would be a major step forward in nuclear arms control. It would be an important barrier both to the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries and to the expansion of existing nuclear arsenals-and both are equally important. Agreement between the superpowers is the essential first step towards the cessation of tests by all countries in all environments.41.	The pre-eminence of the super-Powers is also such that agreement between them must provide the foundation for progress  not merely towards mutual limitation but also towards the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament. In this context the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union are of fundamental importance. We welcome the significant measure of progress which the two States have already achieved and their commitment to continuing negotiations into the future.42.	It goes without saying that the success of arms control efforts in the nuclear sphere is closely linked to satisfactory international controls on the utilization of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Australia recognizes the right of all States to share in the utilization .of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. We believe that there should be the widest possible agreement on an appropriate framework for the management and operation of the nuclear fuel cycle. This requires stringent safeguards and controls on nuclear materials  equipment and technology to prevent their misuse for military purposes But alongside these  and of equal importance  there must be incentives for countries that  have unreservedly forsworn the nuclear weapons option. Such a framework will strengthen the non-proliferation regime. In this regard  Australia strongly supports the impending international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation.43.	It is of course the most striking historical irony of our era that the nuclear energy which has given rise to the problem of proliferation also offers the only economic solution to another urgent problem facing the international community over the next few decades  namely  the prospect of energy shortages.44.	No other issue so strikingly reflects the interdependence of the nations of our planet  for it affects all countries. None demonstrates so clearly the need for intensified co-operation to avoid what could be potentially disastrous consequences  politically  economically and socially  if the world proves incapable of a smooth and rapid adjustment from a primarily oil-based economy to one reliant on renewable and non-depletable sources of energy. We do not underestimate the difficulty of bringing about such a change  which will require considerable effort and many sacrifices on the part of all nations and will test our innovative skills to the utmost. Such a change will also-and I stress this-require a sustained and imaginative effort on the part of Governments to impress the gravity of the situation on the consciousness of their people  to make them fully aware of what is at risk if a solution is not found. But I am optimistic that  provided we co-operate closely  we shall succeed in overcoming the energy problems that face us.45.	It is possible that by the mid-1980s  and virtually certain by the 1990s  there will be dislocations in the world's supply of oil as global oil resources become more rapidly depleted. The major oil-producing and oil-consuming countries are fully aware of this situation and will increasingly want to reserve oil supplies for non-substitutable energy and non-energy uses. In the light of this  Governments will be required to take urgent action to conserve energy use  to promote the development of conventional sources of energy and to develop  through intensified research and development programmes  alternative non-conventional energy sources which are both renewable and non-depletable. These are actions that cannot be put off until next year or the next decade. Given the long lead times involved and the prospect of energy shortages  action must be taken by Governments now. Many Governments  including my own  have recognized these realities and are responding accordingly.46.	Last month the Australian Government announced a range of policies designed to promote the development of Australia's energy resources. Our decision to proceed with the mining and export of Australia's uranium will have important implications for the world community. Bearing in mind that we possess some 20 per cent of the Western world's proven low-cost reserves and have no domestic nuclear power requirement at this stage  Australia will be in a position to make a significant contribution towards supplying the needs of an increasingly energy-deficient world. Given that the scope for conservation and for expanding conventional energy sources is limited  and that alternative renewable energy sources are unlikely to be brought into commercial use in the short or medium term  an expansion in the use of nuclear power will be essential for the next few decades at least. Recognizing its responsibility to the international community  Australia is prepared to co-operate with other nations to supply uranium  subject to the strictest safeguard conditions  to facilitate this transition.47.	Furthermore  we believe that  in order to overcome the obstacles facing the world community during the transition period in energy  co-operation among nations in this area must be intensified. Bilateral co-operation will be necessary but  in my view  insufficient; With the conclusion of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  no forum currently exists for continuing an international dialogue on energy. The Australian Government earnestly hopes that the failure to reach agreement on a continuation of the energy dialogue at the Conference will prove only temporary. We should spare no effort over the coming months to seek means of establishing international consultations on energy. As a potentially major net exporter of energy  Australia is ready to play its full part in any such future dialogue.48.	When we talk of international interdependence  we are talking not only of the interdependence of countries  but also of issues. For these do not stand apart from each other as discrete problems but are interlocked. I have just mentioned the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in the context of energy; but both the Conference and the energy problem itself are of central importance to the next issue I wish to discuss: the North-South dialogue.49.	That dialogue is about many things and at the deepest level. Economic matters are not the only important ones. But they certainly are important  and so far the dialogue has concentrated most heavily on them.50.	The economies of many countries are heavily dependent on the income derived from exports of agricultural commodities and raw materials  and market forces cause significant fluctuations in the prices of these products. Little wonder  then  that these countries have sought to introduce measures of price stabilization  which would be to the benefit not only of producers but also of consumers.51.	My country is a member of all existing international commodity agreements  many of which have brought together consumers and producers in a natural compact. Some of these agreements have been successful and the problems of others have encouraged the devising of alternative methods of ironing out excessive price fluctuations. Developing countries  concerned over worsening balance of payments positions  have made concerted efforts in UNCTAD for the adoption of measures which would assist in stabilizing prices over a wide range of commodities. In this context  a significant proposal now before the international community is that for an Integrated Programme of Commodities with the associated proposal for the establishment of a common fund.52.	The decision in favour of the establishment of a common fund is perhaps the most notable achievement of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  and I am pleased to have played some part in its adoption at the Ministerial Meeting in Paris in May and June. Subsequently  at the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in London from 8 to 15 June  the Australian Prime Minister urged the creation of a technical working group of experts to examine the matter. The Commonwealth Group  drawn from a cross-section of producer and consumer countries  developed and developing  was requested to report on the issues and considerations. My Government is examining their report  which has just been received  for the contribution it can make to the development of our position on the complex and technical questions associated with defining the common fund's purposes and methods of operation.53.	Negotiations on an Integrated Programme for Commodities are proceeding concurrently with negotiations on tariff and non-tariff barriers affecting trade in a wide range of agricultural and industrial products. My Government welcomes the impetus given to the multilateral trade negotiations. We-are preparing our position in accordance with the time-table agreed upon between the United States and the European Community. We share  too  the concern expressed in London by the major economic partners of the Western world about the dangers of a resort to protectionism. The salutary lesson of the 1930s is clear; so also is that of the 1950s and the 1960s when economic prosperity moved hand-in-hand with an expansion in world trade. We look forward to the acceleration of the multilateral trade negotiations in the hope that the Tokyo round will indeed stimulate increased trade in farm products  raw materials and industrial goods.54.	The Tokyo round is coming to its period of most intensive work at a time when there is growing recognition of the emergence of a significant number of middle-income countries  many of which possess growing industrial sectors and whose concerns to expand overseas markets are understood by my Government. Some of these countries are our neighbours. Some of their products pose special difficulties for sectors of the Australian community. An expansion of world trade would go a long way towards maintaining the very impressive pace of development they have achieved.55.	Progress towards a new international economic order will be influenced also by the transfer of real resources to developing countries. Much of the development debate has hitherto focused on the aggregate levels of such resources. But it is not simply a matter of increasing the volume of aid. The quality of aid  particularly its relevance to the needs and priorities of the recipient countries themselves  is at least as important as quantity. In both these respects  1 believe Australia's record is a good one: 425 million Australian dollars have been allocated to official development assistance for 1977/1978  an increase of 12 per cent. In United States dollar terms  the programme is approaching the half billion dollar mark. Virtually all of this assistance is in grant form. Our contribution to multilateral agencies will increase by 47 per cent in this financial year  reflecting the confidence we have in the major United Nations agencies  particularly UNDP. We have made significant further progress in untying aid for bilateral projects; over-all Australian bilateral aid is already substantially untied. My Government has undertaken multiyear commitments covering the major portion of our bilateral programme  as well as several multilateral organizations. Important new initiatives in regard to the funding of local costs of projects have also been undertaken. As a major food supplier  Australia is fully aware of the global concern to meet basic food requirements and to improve food security. Australia has recently announced several important new measures relating to food aid  including a substantial increase in food aid assistance and a commitment to contribute to an international reserve for emergencies.56.	My delegation had hoped that it would prove possible for the General Assembly to reach agreement on the assessment of the outcome of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. The Conference was a most important event  and Australians applauded the framework it provided for the concurrent examination of an enormous range of issues. Many of these issues were  and are  complex and not easily solved. The greatest achievement of the Conference lies in the exposure of these complexities  the greater understanding which I believe all participants derived in consequence  and the ere; ion of an atmosphere conducive to future dialogue. The concrete results of the Conference have fallen short of the expectations of many  but results there were. We recognize them for what they are  another step along the path towards equity  justice and rationality in international economic relations.57.	I have spoken of the North-South dialogue in terms of the global economic issues and discussions which are most familiar to us and which capture most of the headlines  but I believe it is important that we not lose sight of the progress which is being made at other levels  in less dramatic gatherings. That progress is a reminder that not everything must wait on the solution of the big problems. As an example of what I have in mind  I draw the Assembly's attention to a development of great importance at the recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Port Moresby in regard to law of the sea and fishing matters. The independent and self-governing island Governments of the region decided at Port Moresby to co-operate closely with each other on the declaration of the 200-mile fisheries or exclusive economic zones and to establish a regional fisheries agency to enable them to secure the maximum benefits from the living resources of such zones. Australia warmly welcomes these developments and is co-operating with other countries in the region in securing agreements which will help to realize the important potential to be derived from maritime resources.58.	If any one thing has characterized international affairs in the last year  it has been the unprecedented and very significant attention given to the question of human rights. This has not developed suddenly and unannounced. It is a response to forces which have been at work over a period of years. Among these are: the articulate demand in Western societies over the last 10 years for a foreign policy which specifically reflects democratic and liberal values; the third world's stress on human rights in its fight against apartheid  and its demand for a new international economic order; and the sustained  eloquent and courageous effort by oppressed people in many countries to draw the world's attention to their plight. Together these seem to indicate the likelihood of a trend towards a greater stress on the moral dimensions of international politics in general  and human rights in particular.59.	Australia takes its human rights seriously. Our election to the Commission on Human Rights in May of this year gives an additional reason for doing so. The question of human rights is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture  too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations. It is related in the most direct way to questions of human suffering  human dignity and freedom. If we cannot take it seriously  we would do better to stop talking about it at all.60.	There are very difficult problems to be worked out. The problem of selectivity on the part of Governments-or  for that matter  of Special interest groups-in expressing concern about human rights is one of them. Such selectivity is not necessarily evidence of cynicism  though it is often advanced as such. Given that Governments have a multiplicity of responsibilities  it is inevitable and proper that their commitment to human rights should be balanced against other valid commitments. These commitments include not only a concern for the national interest but  in the case of the great majority of Governments  the promotion of international peace and order. The tension between the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of detente between the super-Powers  for example  is not an artificial trumped-up thing; it really exists  and it does present hard choices. Such choices involve not merely the weighing of human rights considerations against those of ""realism""  though that is often unavoidable; sometimes they involve weighing human rights against other goals- such as peace  international order  national cohesion-which also represent moral values  and sometimes these other goals will prevail. The fact that they do is evidence  not of cynicism or hypocrisy  but of the essential nature of moral choice.61.	The problem of the different meanings and priorities given to human rights in different cultural  social and political contexts is an extremely important one. Given our geographic position  we in Australia have a pretty lively sense of this. What  for instance  is the proper relationship of civil and political rights to economic and social rights? Is it the case that economic rights are in some sense more fundamental than political rights  as some Governments maintain  or is the relationship more variable  ambiguous and complex than that? There is evidence  both in the form of behaviour at elections and in the form of political protest movements  which suggests that people are not indifferent to political rights  even when they lack economic rights.62.	Again  what is the relationship between individual rights  which are the ones classically stressed in Western thinking  and collective and group rights  often stressed by the third world?63.	And again  how should the existence of real internal threats to civil order and peace within a country influence our expectations concerning respect for human rights? Should we expect the same standards of behaviour from a Government under the pressure of such threats as we expect from a Government having the good fortune to enjoy an essentially peaceful and orderly domestic situation? Is there a legitimate distinction to be made between Governments whose problems are largely of their own making and ones which have inherited deep-set structural and cultural problems?64.	All these are extraordinarily difficult questions. They are made more difficult by the fact that sometimes good arguments are misused and misapplied. But if the concern for human rights is going to find expression in practical  effective terms  and not be relegated to the sphere of Utopian aspirations  they are questions which demand our attention.65.	No situation in the world more forcefully illustrates the importance of the issue of human rights than does that in southern Africa  where the systematic neglect and the violation of those rights have created an explosive state of affairs. Australia's attitude to the imperative issues of human rights which still remain to be resolved in southern Africa was forcefully expressed by the Australian Prime Minister  Mr. Malcolm Fraser  at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London in June.66.	More recently  I had occasion as leader of the Australian delegation at the World Conference for Action against Apartheid -to make very clear our stand on that issue  and to survey the practical measures we have undertaken in respect of it. At Lagos  as earlier at Maputo. there was an impressive degree of consensus on the problems-and on the consequences of not resolving them.67.	It is heartening that important initiatives have been launched to find peaceful negotiated settlements in Rhodesia and Namibia. The Anglo-American proposals forZimbabwe have provided a foundation for a peaceful settlement in keeping with the demand for majority rule and independence. The world  and the Zimbabwean parties to the dispute  will have cause for congratulation if the opportunity is seized and reason and generosity prevail.68.	Again in relation to Namibia  we see a significant initiative in train. And again this initiative draws its strength from the persistence of the international community in its demand that the Territory should achieve independence through free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Australia  in the United Nations Council for Namibia and elsewhere  has worked for this goal and commends the current effort for its achievements.69.	There appears to have been a significant shift in the policies of the South African Government toward Namibia. This shift is very late  and it is in response to international pressure  but it does offer a glimmer of hope that the path of dialogue is not completely closed.70.	With southern Africa  the Middle East situation remains the major danger to international peace. In fact  in our view  it constitutes the single most dangerous and volatile point of potential conflict in world politics. As any further outbreak of war in the region would almost certainly eclipse previous ones in terms of destructiveness  and as it must also be considered doubtful whether it could be contained  the resolution of the conflict is of concern to all Members.71.	I take this opportunity to place on the record once again the Australian Government's recognition of the need for early settlement between Israel and the Arab States. The Australian Government continues to consider that the general principles on which a settlement should be based are those set out in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973). Any settlement will also have to take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The efforts which President Carter's administration has made  and is continuing to make  to foster negotiations between the parties are greatly appreciated by the Australian Government  [n the context of the important need to maintain this momentum we should much regret the intrusion of potentially disruptive elements into the negotiating process.72.	In coming to terms with all the critical international problems which confront us  it is as important to give thought to finding appropriate and effective means as it is to give thought to the ends to be sought. It is with this well in mind that the Australian Government has been active during the past year in promoting an infinitive on review of the multilateral treaty-making process  The multinational treaty is an important—if not the most important—instrument of adjustment in the international community It evidences the corning together of our sovereign wills in a precise and focused manner.73.	However  vital though multilateral treaties are in the life of this Organization  we have never collectively addressed ourselves to the question: What is the best way inwhich to go about making such treaties? We must satisfy ourselves that we are using the most efficient methods to convert our ideas for co-operation and improvement into clear and acceptable treaty language. The process of gestation of a multilateral treaty is both sensitive and complex. We must ensure that it makes the least possible demands upon our administrative and financial resources. The human skills which are involved in the conferences  committees and working parties and other meetings which eventually lead to a treaty text are also badly needed to perform other services.74.	Our aim  therefore  is to invite the United Nations to direct its attention to these important procedural matters. If the system can be improved  let us improve it. If it cannot be improved  let us at last have the satisfaction of knowing that the present methods are as perfect as deliberate consideration can make them.75.	We have consulted widely before introducing item 124 in the agenda. The positive terms of the responses which we have had from other States have been very gratifying. In all quarters  in all regional groups  the prospective utility of this item has been acknowledged as evidenced in part by the number and range of States which have joined us in sponsoring it. As the first stage in an assessment which must be spread over several sessions  we now look forward to a serious and constructive debate in the Sixth Committee.76.	While we hope for success in this and in other possible efforts to improve the working tools at our disposal  we must at the same time continue to confront the many serious problems which face us in this increasingly complex and interdependent world. I have discussed what my Government believes are the most pressing and significant of these problems. There are two observations that can be made about all of them. The first is that  so far as solving them is concerned  time is a wasting asset. Delay  waiting on events  will only magnify the problems. Indeed  in some cases delay must lead to disaster. If we are to act effectively  we must act quickly. My second observation is that the solution of these problems will depend crucially on the mustering of the necessary political will. Difficult and complex as these problems are  they will become insoluble only if we decide to treat them as such. Someone has made the acute observation that decadence begins when people can no longer ask  ""What are we going to do? but rather ""What is going to happen to us?"" when  that is  will surrenders to events  and resignation and fatalism take over.77.	They must not be allowed to take over. Our fate will not be determined by some inexorable historical laws nor by objective circumstances. It will be determined by the way we respond to the challenges which confront us; it is in our own hands. "
"7",360,"AUT",32,1977,"﻿1.	May I through you  Mr. President  congratulate the President of this Assembly on his election. Our pleasure at seeing him in the chair is alsoexplained by the fact that he represents Yugoslavia  a neighbouring country with whom we share a host of common interests and manifold traditional ties.2.	In the election of Mr. Mojsov this Assembly has chosen a President who combines extensive knowledge acquired through his own observation with a deep devotion to the ideals of our Organization. The fact that lie will be conducting the work of this Assembly augurs well for the success of our common endeavour.3.	At this stage I should also like to express to his predecessor in the chair  Ambassador Amerasinghe  my country's thanks and recognition for the tact and exceptional insight with which he led the previous General Assembly. His conduct of our deliberations was in keeping with the best traditions of his country  Sri Lanka.4.	It is a special joy for me to greet the new Members of this Organization  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. Their admission is consistent with the principle of the universality of the United Nations laid down in the Charter and will contribute much to the success of our work.5.	The Vietnamese people have painfully experienced the horrors of war. We can therefore expect that that people will be among the most resolute champions of a policy of peace.6.	This Organization was created after the catastrophe of a great war in order to give mankind peace and security. The immediate past  in which millions were denied their dignity and were deprived of their rights  was the origin of a deepening concern to protect human rights for the future.7.	By setting up the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and proclaiming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  this Organization made itself an advocate of the rights of man. Next year will be the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration. That occasion makes it appropriate to assess the work of our Organization and this Assembly in the light of the goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.8.	Since the admission of my country to this Organization  Austria has consciously sought to promote the protection of human rights and has made such protection a major effort and objective of its foreign policy.9.	At the time of the founding of the United Nations the concept of human rights was limited essentially to the so-called civil and political freedoms as they emerged at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Today  however  human rights embrace  in addition to these freedoms  economic  social and cultural rights. At least since the 1968 Teheran Conference  their equal status was no longer disputed. Man's dignity  the guaranteeing of his social and economic security  and the free development of his whole personality are today's goal in the protection of human rights.10.	However  it is not only the significance of human rights that has changed. Certainly  human rights are violated today just as they were in the past. Thus  the Secretary- General has stated very pertinently in his report on the work of this Organization that:""Perhaps more than in any other field of international activity we face in the human rights field the gulf between idealistic declarations and hard realities.11.	Nevertheless  it cannot be denied that today more than ever before in history human rights are more deeply rooted in the consciousness of men and even of Governments-even those which violate them. This may well be the reason why we frequently have the impression that today human rights are violated on a larger scale than in the past.12.	In the past  with less awareness of the subject  violations of human rights were often not recognized as such. The first and decisive step in the realization of an idea is always the creation of awareness. Therefore  information and education play an all-important role in the realization of this idea. For this reason Austria follows with great interest the relevant work of UNESCO and the United Nations University. We shall vigorously support these efforts.13.	Recent years and decades have enabled us to recognize the interdependence between a policy of respect for the dignity and worth of the individual and the maintenance of peace and security. Today we see more clearly than ever that peace and security require progress in man's free social  political  economic and cultural development.14.	It is  therefore  a source of deep concern for us that  despite repeated and sincere efforts in the past year  hardly one of the world’s crises is closer to a settlement  The people of the areas concerned arc still denied a life in security and peace. It seems worth making the point that the causes of all these problems He ultimately in the violation or denial of human rights. This is true for the crises in the Middle East  in Cyprus and in southern Africa  as well as for the lack of progress of the disarmament efforts. It applies equally to the crisis in the relations between North and South. That crisis has its origin in the imperfect provision on a global scale of economic and social rights to all the peoples of our planet. In view of its joint commitment to guarantee human rights  the international community as a whole bears joint responsibility for improving this situation.15.	We are still far from securing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Prominent among the indispensable elements of a peace settlement are the principles laid down in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Another element is the reciprocal recognition of justified demands. In this connexion it must be expected of Israel that it recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  in particular their right to self-determination and a homeland. From the Palestinian people we must expect the recognition of Israel's right to exist in peace with its neighbours in the area.90. Finally  the parties to the conflict must refrain from any action that might prejudice a negotiated solution. Thus  we note with concern that the Israeli Government is authorizing the establishment of settlements of its citizens in the occupied territories.91.	The Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East offers an appropriate forum for negotiations. Its reactivation and support for it seem to us more urgent than ever. We do not underestimate the difficulties standing in the way of reconvening that Conference. We welcome  therefore  the resoluteness with which the Co-Chairmen of the Conference have just recently called for the resumption of the negotiations.92.	The continued suppression of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia has already led to violence and bloodshed. We are particularly distressed that the victims of violence include innocent men  women and children  and people who had dedicated their lives to the service of their fellow-men.93.	Every opportunity must be seized to secure by peaceful means the long overdue exercise of their right to self-determination and to introduce forms of Government that are based on democratic principles and on respect for the rights of the majority  as well as those of the minority.94.	""the important role the United Nations plays in the implementation of the right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination has been demonstrated by the recent decision of tie Security Council concerning the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General for Southern Rhodesia in its resolution 415 (1977).95.	We appreciate highly the endeavour of Western members of the Security Council  in close co-operation with the South West Africa People's Organization and the Secretary- General of the United Nations  to secure the speedy independence of Namibia. We are also following with great interest the further efforts of the United Kingdom  supported by the United States  to create the necessary conditions for majority rule in Zimbabwe.96.	The most serious problem in southern Africa  for which a solution is still not in sight  is the policy of apartheid of South Africa. The Government of that country must be brought to realize that the system of apartheid offends our sense of moral decency. The South African Government must finally recognize that peaceful coexistence among the peoples of southern Africa is not feasible as long as the vast majority of the population of South Africa is denied full and equal enjoyment of civil  political  social  economic and cultural rights. There can be no doubt that it is also in the self-interest of South Africa's white population to renounce the inhuman policy of apartheid.97.	The World Conference held at Lagos last August furnished yet another impressive proof of the world-wide rejection and condemnation of the policy of apartheid.98.	Human rights also play an important role in another crisis: the crisis of Cyprus. We hope that this crisis will be resolved by maintaining the century-old bonds of the two communities in a Republic of Cyprus  whose independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity this Organization has so often acknowledged.99.	The Secretary-General of our Organization deserves thanks and recognition for his tireless endeavours in ""the search for a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus conflict. This is perhaps the place to give general acknowledgement to his large personal contribution to the cause of peace in the world and for the success of the Organization.100.	Credit for the significant role which the United Nations plays to the maintenance of peace in the Middle East and Cyprus belongs not least to the peace-keeping forces operating under the United Nations flag.101.	May I once again express to all the United Nations troops our deeply felt thanks for their splendid contribution. At the same time I wish to pay a tribute to the memory of those who gave their lives serving the United Nations.102.	In this connexion  may I express our deep concern about the current state of the financing of the peacekeeping operations  Compared to the modest amounts spent by the international community on peace-keeping operations  the scale of the annual expenditures on armaments remains enormous.103.	The arms race of recent years has not led just to an extremely dangerous blurring of the line between nuclear and conventional weapons and to the increased danger of a further proliferation of nuclear weapons. It also entails irresponsible squandering of financial resources  of human research capacity and of raw materials.104.	I am very well aware of the very complex nature of disarmament and arms control measures  as well as of their link with the security of States. For this reason we realize the difficulty for the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Yet we must use that opportunity  which may not come again  to devise  with the active co-operation of all  a new and a comprehensive approach to the problem of disarmament and to adopt genuine disarmament measures. If  in so doing we again point to the special responsibility of the great Powers  that does not mean that all other States are released from their responsibility. It means rather that by objective criteria the existing arsenals of those Powers imply not only special prerogatives but also the obligation to clearer the way for genuine disarmament  which is inconceivable without their co-operation. In this respect we are encouraged by the forthright stand taken by President Carter in his important address to this Assembly yesterday105.	Finally  in addressing the problem of disarmament and particularly the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear arms it is impossible not to mention the important role of IAEA.106.	The world economy is another area which requires intensified international co-operation. The uncertainty that now marks the economic situation of many countries demands resolute concerted action by the international community.107.	A broad consensus is now emerging that a new international economic order is one of the most important pre-conditions for the establishment of better economic relations reflecting a higher degree of world-wide solidarity and justice. The ideas related to the new international economic order have been spelled out more clearly in recent years and point  in particular  to the urgency of satisfying man's basic needs  especially in the poorest countries and population groups.108.	A new international order will contribute  therefore  to the realization of human rights  without which many hundreds of millions have no hope of worthy human existence. But such an order will also require new forms of international co-operation  especially with regard to the creation of the infrastructure necessary for economic and social progress in the developing countries.109.	At an earlier stage of the debate the Austrian Chancellor  Sir. Bruno Kreisky  urged a faster rate of infrastructural development  primarily in the field of transportation  within the framework of a major multilateral plan for the developing countries  especially those of Africa. As many industrialized States as possible  together with other States in a position to do so  should co-operate in an endeavour of this kind. In view of the tasks to be accomplished and of the scale of the resources required  such an initiative could well be compared with the Marshall Plan  which was so essential for the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War.110.	We have noted with particular satisfaction that the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  responding to an initiative of African States  agreed on measures for the improvement of Africa's economic and social infrastructures  with emphasis on transport and communications. A further step was taken at this year's summer session of the Economic and Social Council by the adoption of resolution 2097 (LXIII) providing for the proclamation by the General Assembly of a Transport and Communications Decade in Africa for 1978-1988. Austria warmly welcomes this resolution and hopes that it will be endorsed by this Assembly. The Austrian Federal Government is ready to co-operate actively in the preparation and implementation of programmes for the attainment of the objectives of such a decade.111.	One of the central tasks of the United Nations in the coming years will be to work out a new international development strategy consistent with the new international economic order. We expect that the current General Assembly will begin  in a practical way  to lay the groundwork for the formulation of this strategy and thus create the conditions for real progress in the relevant negotiations. Particular care should be taken  in our view  that work on the new strategy does not prejudge commitments entered into for the current Second United Nations Development Decade.112.	The fundamental objectives of international development co-operation undoubtedly include a better exchange of scientific and technological knowledge and closer international co-operation in the application of this knowledge to the development process. Hence the special significance of the 1979 United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development.113.	Austria stands ready to contribute its best to the successful conduct of this most important United NationsConference. As an expression of my country's great interest in international co-operation in the field of science and technology  the Austrian Federal Government extended an invitation for that Conference to be held in Vienna. It gives me great pleasure to reiterate that invitation at this stage.114.	In the process of breaking new grounds and creating new ideas we expect a significant contribution from the commission whose establishment was announced from United Nations Headquarters by Mr. Willy Brandt the former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.115.	My remarks so far have focused on the need for comprehensive and universal implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and their connexion with economic and social development. Concern for the well- being of the individual is one of the cardinal principles of Austrian foreign policy. We are not afraid to stand up for the victims of human rights violations  no matter where they may occur  and we are always ready to give help to the greatest extent possible.116.	Austria has always tried to make an active contribution to the work of the United Nations bodies concerned with human rights questions. I should like to express Austria's appreciation of the work done to these bodies. They have constantly sought to advance the cause of human rights despite the wide variety of views and the differing social and political systems represented in these bodies.117.	In speaking of human rights I should like to pay a tribute to the valuable contribution which regional organizations make in this field. As the representative of a European country I should like at this point to stress the significance of the European Convention on human rights and the European Social Charter. By adopting these instruments the member States of the Council of Europe have agreed on effective machinery for the protection of human rights.118.	Respect for the dignity of man  of all men  is  as I have already said  one of our essential concerns. The denial of equality and of the equal dignity which is the birth right of all people by means of racism  especially in its most extreme form-apartheid- is revolting to the conscience of man. Therefore we support the objectives of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  as proclaimed in resolution 3057 (XXVIII)  and we hope that the world conference to combat racism and racial discrimination  scheduled for 1978  will bring us closer to the goal of eliminating all forms of racial discrimination.119.	We agree with many other members of the Assembly that the combating of international terrorism  which represents a serious threat to fundamental human rights  is an important task of our Organization. In addition to dealing with the comprehensive aspects of this issue  we must also tackle as a matter of particular urgency its most abominable manifestations. Therefore we welcome the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of anInternational Convention against the Taking of Hostages established by the General Assembly at its thirty-first session has begun its work.120.	Despite earnest efforts the United Nations has still not succeeded in making a decisive break-through in the fight against the use of torture. We appeal once again to all the Members of this Organization to work together to eliminate this barbaric form of violation of human rights and to create an effective tool for combating it.121.	The primary task of our Organization is the establishment and maintenance of peace in the world. This task cannot be viewed solely in terms of the Organization's mediating role in conflicts or the sending of United Nations troops on peace-keeping missions. The United Nations has rightly recognized that peace requires a broad basis. Day by day we in this Assembly are working at building and extending this basis.122.	We consider the promotion and development of the policy of detente to be an essential prerequisite for that endeavour. We should like the policy of detente to be understood not merely in its original East-West context; rather it should be understood in a broader sense. In an interdependent world where space and time have been mastered on an unprecedented scale  detente must be seen as a global process. It should be understood to be that desirable minimum of mutual trust in inter-State relations which provides the fertile soil for the flowering of human potentialities. Detente is the foundation on which human rights and freedoms can be shaped and developed  the framework for the peaceful competition of ideas and systems. For us  detente is a goal to which world politics must constantly aspire; it is a dynamic concept.123.	In this connexion I wish to express our appreciation of the special role of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which marked a qualitatively new dimension in the process of detente. The review conference that has just opened in Belgrade is another important step in the direction in which the Helsinki Conference has pointed.124.	If detente is to be effective and lasting it must operate also at the human level and must take account of humanitarian concerns and the desire for a better flow of information and exchange of contacts across frontiers. If people and nations can perceive the direct results of detente in this way  they will better understand the need for detente.125.	Let me now briefly refer to the agreement reached between Austria and Italy eight years ago which is concerned with increasing the autonomy of the South Tyrol and lays down a time-table for that process. In the spirit of neighbourly co-operation between our two States we have been able to make further progress this past year within the framework of that agreement. However  a number of measures provided for in that time-framework have still to be put into effect. We are confident that the efforts devoted to this question  on which the General Assembly adopted resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI)  will soon produce further progress and bring us closer to a final solution.126.	I should also like to refer to Austria's traditional role as host country for international organizations and conferences. As in the past  Austria had the honour this year again to host a number of important conferences and sessions of United Nations bodies.127.	Work on the Donaupark Centre  which is being built in Vienna for the United Nations and will be made available to the Organization free of charge  is going ahead according to schedule. Office accommodation will be ready for occupancy at the end of 1978. From those facilities the United- Nations will derive considerable financial and organizational benefits. Therefore we expect that the General Assembly at its thirty-third session will take  in accordance with the phase® plan contained in resolution 31/194  adopted unanimously by the General Assembly on 22 December 1976  necessary decisions in this matter.128.	The past year has again witnessed serious and tragic conflicts. Yet it cannot be denied that no other era has been so convinced of the possibility and necessity of resolving these conflicts by adhering to universally accepted standards conceived by the ingenuity of man. International co-operation  especially within our Organization  is of the greatest significance for the attainment of that goal. The success of the United Nations depends on the contribution that each individual Member State is prepared to make.129.	As in the past  Austria will make its contribution to the attainment of the high purposes of the Charter of our Organization. "

May I repeat to you  Mr. President  the commitment of my Government to co-operate closely with you to ensure the total success of the noble task that has been entrusted to you by the Assembly.86.	I also wish to pay a well-earned tribute to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the outstanding representative of Sri Lanka  for the skilful and noble way in which he directed the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. Guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  Mr. Amerasinghe led with tact and competence all the varied complex negotiations touching on the very delicate questions dealt with -at the previous session. He has earned our thanks.87.	On behalf of my Government  I should like also to express our great admiration for the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless dedication to our Organization. Since he assumed his high post  the Secretary-General has imposed upon himself great sacrifices to have the ideals of the Charter prevail in all circumstances  particularly in the fields of decolonization  international security and fruitful co-operation among States. The renewal of his mandate is the highest accolade that the international community could bestow upon him. The Government of the Republic of Burundi  on whose behalf I have the honour to speak  reiterates its confidence in him and supports him in his efforts to make of our Organization ""the crucible in which a new community of all humanity will be moulded"" devoted to co-operation and solidarity in the fulfilment of the great tasks and plans for the future.88.	The entry of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to our Organization constitutes new victories for all the justice-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world. The independence of Djibouti is part of the history of the glorious struggle of national liberation movements against colonialism and foreign domination. It reminds the international community that the era of colonization and servitude has passed. The delegation of Burundi wishes these friendly countries continued successes in the consolidation of their independence.89.	The admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to our Organization is a tribute paid to its gallant people  whose courage  unity and determination earned them the most outstanding victory against the most daunting of foes. The triumph of the Vietnamese people is an unchallengeable proof that a people that is united and .revolutionary can foil all plots against its unity and independence. It is an example of sacrifice that proves to us that the future of peoples belongs to those that are willing to rise arms in hand and that it is necessary from the first to wrest significant victories from the enemy so that the enemy will genuinely embark on the path of negotiation. However  the feelings of joy and admiration created by this admission must not blind us to the obligations of the international community towards the Vietnamese people. Viet Nam  the victim of the most bloody neo-colonialist war of aggression known to history  has to face immense problems of national reconstruction. The people of Burundi  which has always called for a halt to imperialist aggression against the friendly people of Viet Nam  is happy to enjoy ties of friendship and solidarity with that country. On behalf of my Government  I wish to express our hopes that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will be successful in its great task of reconstruction.90.	The heroic and victorious struggle of the people of Viet Nam falls within the context of the universal revolutionary struggle which the peoples are unleashing in order to shake off foreign aggression and to build a new society based on justice and equality. From that standpoint the delegation of Burundi feels that the social revolution  in the course of the last 12 months  has scored great victories in the world.91.	The date 1 November 1976 marked a decisive turning- point in the history of the people of Burundi  which decided to put an end to the after-effects of colonization and to the contradictions of the old regime. In fact  the Burundi people decided to make a radical change that did not entail the shedding of a single drop of blood. The political  economic and social retrogression of the country had created a climate that cried out for new structures that would meet the aspirations of the Burundi people  determined to consolidate its age-old unity  its cultural identity and its accessibility to the world.92.	The conditions for these profound and popular changes were established: the peasants  the workers   the intellectuals and the military  in a sacred alliance under the leadership of His Excellency Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza  the President of the Second Republic  undertook a process of social  cultural  political and economic liberation.93.	One of the measures that we had inherited from colonization was a minimum personal levy. This head tax  added to the income tax  had proved socially unjust because it fell upon every adult male  without distinction  simply by virtue of his existing. The source of much misery  it forced many heads of family to live in uncertainty of the morrow or in servitude. In its concern to ensure social justice  the new regime suppressed that servitude. The people warmly greeted that decision  which liberated the men of Burundi  and turned their efforts from then on  unhindered  to agricultural and industrial production.94.	Aware of the need to struggle against food shortages  the Government of the Second Republic is adopting a policy of harnessing all the national possibilities. To this end a number of measures have already been taken; as far as land is concerned  an agrarian reform has been carried out. That important decision makes possible the rational exploitation of land with a view to the carrying out of farming and livestock projects and the equitable distribution of land to the peasants. That policy foiled the plans of those who wanted to take the fertile land from the peasants and distribute it to an emerging national bourgeoisie. The recovery of all of this land for the benefit of the whole community and the elimination of all forms of bondage inherent in the feudal system of other days were welcomed enthusiastically by the people of Burundi. In order to exploit fully the land available in a country with one of the most dense populations in Africa  the Government is engaged in a policy of resettlement of the population. It plans to establish conditions more favourable for housing and the supply of drinking water to rural areas. In this context  the objectives and recommendations laid down by the Habitat Conference at Vancouver and the Water Conference at Mar del Plata will find a more appropriate framework for their application  on condition  of course  that there is bilateral and international cc-operation. The Government hopes also to set up in-its village centres health and education services. This effort of national recovery cannot succeed unless there is popular participation in national decisions. That is why the new regime has created conditions favourable to a more intense political participation by the Parti de l'unite pour le progres national. Today that party  which has recovered national independence and the dignity of the Burundi people  is so formed that each Burundi may participate actively in national life and express his views freely. For a number of months  seminars have been organized throughout the country at which public debates are held on all the important problems with which we are confronted. All are invited to share in this exercise of national debate. The Government  basing itself on the conclusions of these seminars  will be able to plan and carry out the development of the country.95.	The economic liberation in which we are engaged is based on the profound determination to rely on our own ability and the firm will to exercise sovereignty over national resources for the benefit in the first place of the Burundi people. It is from that standpoint that we shall carry out negotiations to develop our mineral resources.96.	This policy of industrialization must go hand in hand with the intensification and diversification of agriculture  which is the major priority for a country where 90 per cent of the population is rural.97.	The main objective of the new regime is to satisfy  as soon as possible  the basic needs of each Burundi in such fields as food  health  education and housing in a healthy society based on equity  justice and liberty. The new society of Burundi that emerged from the movement of 1 November 1976 allows all citizens  without distinction as to race  sex  or religious conviction or philosophy  to enjoy their civil and political  economic  social and cultural rights. Hence  in the new Burundi  freedom of opinion and of expression. is guaranteed. Freedom of worship is assured; education is free; and the right to own property and the right of land tenure have just been completely recovered. The right to housing and to health care also is a real objective  although the Government is aware of the immense task that remains to be accomplished in this field. Finally  let it be noted that in this country  whose hospitality is legendary  there has not been a single political prisoner since the profound and peaceful revolution of 1 November 1976.98.	The new Burundi has become the favoured land in the effective application of all the fundamental human rights. I am therefore proud to be the representative of a regime which respects in its actions the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  and which applies to its nationals and to foreigners alike the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The people of Burundi  who have just won a great victory  on the one hand by throwing the vestiges of colonialism into the dustbin of history  and on the other hand by overcoming internal contradictions  wishes to contribute to a greater extent to the freedom of other peoples still dominated by imperialism  racism and colonialism 99.	The Government of Burundi is deeply concerned by the violation of fundamental human rights in different parts of the world. In many countries torture has become a daily occurrence and fundamental freedoms are trodden under foot. It will be said  no doubt  that the history of mankind is unfortunately made up in part of these inhuman practices. The renewal of the defence of human rights  cannot but delight my delegation. Nevertheless  that feeling of satisfaction for my delegation is mixed with a degree of disappointment. Some Governments in fact wish to use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a new political weapon against certain States whose socio-political regimes appear to them to be a challenge to their own systems of Government. In the end  in this confrontation  the role of the individual is but that of a screen for their plan to interfere in the internal affairs of other sovereign States with a view to overcoming them politically  economically or even militarily.100.	My delegation believes that a State Member that has relations of co-operation with a regime that is condemned by the international community for having committed crimes against mankind and for having constantly violated fundamental human rights and freedoms has no credibility when it claims to defend human rights. Thus all States  all organizations  governmental or not  which have cooperative links of any nature whatsoever with the Vorster regime cannot pose as champions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  for they are strengthening the system of apartheid  which is  on the model of nazism and fascism  a crime against mankind and a threat to international peace and security.101.	At least once a year  virtually all the States Members of our Organization and many governmental organizations condemn the system of apartheid and those who uphold its regime. World opinion is deeply affronted by the inhuman situation that prevails in South Africa. The international community is convinced that apartheid must be eliminated  in the first place because it is a crime against humanity; in the second place  because apartheid is a real insult to human dignity and grave threat to international peace and security; in the third place  so that the African continent may regain its dignity  which has been denied to it for centuries and at last play its rightful role in international affairs. Finally  this cancer that gnaws at the southern part of the African continent must disappear to pave the way for true international co-operation. In spite of this almost universal condemnation by the international community  the blacks  who comprise the overwhelming majority of the •population  are denied the most elementary rights. Through repressive laws  the Vorster regime conducts arbitrary arrests  murders of innocent people  systematic torture and assassinations of political detainees. The latest to which the international community has been witness is that of Steven Biko  to whom our Organization has paid a moving tribute.102.	By virtue of the racial segregation laws  millions of people are brutally sent to arid reserves or urban ghettos. Thousands of patriots are tortured  massacred or exiled.103.	The arrogance of the South African regime has encouraged it not only to show contempt for the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council  but also to carry out armed aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and Namibia. To confirm the warlike intentions of the Pretoria regime  South Africa has recently promulgated an alleged Internal Security Amendment Act  under which the Vorster regime extends the South African sphere of defence to the south of the Sahara. The north of the Sahara is the sphere of aggression reserved for Israel.104.	It must be pointed out also that this alliance of aggression has led Pretoria and Tel Aviv to co-operate in the military and nuclear sphere. The two racist and Zionist regimes have now acquired nuclear capacity.105.	The response to this challenge of the international community by South Africa has been given by the South African people themselves whose heroic struggle has aroused sympathy and indignation everywhere in the world. The people of South Africa tried to recover their rights by peaceful means  but that approach cost them very dear. They were forced by the increased brutality and pressure of the criminal regime to choose other means with which to conduct their struggle. The Government of the Republic of Burundi supports unreservedly the struggle which the people of South Africa have been forced to undertake. I appeal to all States to give political and material support to this legitimate struggle being waged by the people of South Africa under the leadership of its liberation movement to wipe this scourge from our planet.106.	My delegation believes that the time has come for all States Members of the Organization  and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  to apply against South Africa the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In fact  the regime of apartheid in South Africa constitutes not only a crime against humanity but also a grave threat to international peace and security.107.	Furthermore  South Africa has already been condemned for its aggression against an independent State  Angola. It constantly violates the recommendations and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  particularly those that have called for binding sanctions against Southern Rhodesia and those that call upon South Africa to withdraw from Namibia the administration and the forces of illegal occupation that it has there. In furtherance of the isolation of the regime of Pretoria  my delegation makes an urgent appeal to all countries to put an end to their diplomatic  consular or other relations with South Africa. In the light of the acts of aggression committed by South Africa against some countries  the delegation of Burundi  convinced that the regime of Vorster is immoral and hypocritical  feels that it is imperative to impose a total embargo on all weapons destined for SouthAfrica  and while it is still possible  to revoke all military licences granted to the Government of South Africa. At this crucial and decisive stage of the struggle of the people of South Africa  it would be cynical to offer weapons of mass destruction to some  while advising others calmly to bow their heads before Vorster's executioners. The Nazi and Fascist regimes were only eliminated by armed resistance. Immediate commercial interests that operate because of apartheid cannot make us forget history or prevent us from looking to the future. The people of South Africa will be victorious  regardless of the sacrifices they will have to make.108.	In speaking  of Namibia  the delegation of Burundi wishes to reiterate its whole-hearted support for the people of Namibia in their struggle  under the leadership of their only movement of national liberation  SWAPO  to achieve self-determination  national independence and freedom in a united Namibia. The illegal and colonialist occupation of Namibia by South Africa constitutes an act of aggression against the people of Namibia and a challenge to the United Nations. This seizure of Namibia is a systematic violation by South Africa of the obligations imposed by the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. On behalf of my Government  I whole-heartedly condemn South Africa for those acts of aggression against the people of Namibia and against the United Nations. I furthermore reaffirm the fact that the sole legal authority entitled to administer the Territory until its independence is the United Nations Council for Namibia.109.	We know that  lately  the five Western Powers of the Security Council have advocated a negotiated settlement of the question of Namibia. My Government supports the programme of action adopted by the Central Committee of SWAPO in the course of its meeting from 28 July to 1 August of 1976 at Lusaka  Zambia. Within the framework of that programme  the delegation of Burundi supports the continuation and intensification of the struggle of the people of Namibia until the total liberation of their Territory is achieved. South Africa must give up its plan to create bantustans  publicly admit the right of the people of Namibia to achieve independence and national sovereignty  and publicly recognize the territorial integrity of Namibia to be absolute and non-negotiable. The dismemberment of Namibia by the annexation of Walvis Bay must be rejected unequivocally by the international community. The United Nations must exercise pressure on South Africa to free all political prisoners without exception South Africa must allow all exiled patriots to return to their homes without fear of arrests or threats. The Vorster regime must withdraw its army and its police from Namibia; it must cease using Namibia as a base for aggression against the neighbouring independent African States. And  finally  constitutional negotiations on Namibia must take place under the aegis of the United Nations with a view to organizing free elections in Namibia  under the control and the supervision of the United Nations. The nomination by South Africa of an administrator for the period of transition is an illegal act  because the Vorster regime is illegally occupying Namibia.110.	The Burundi delegation therefore calls upon all States to refrain from any act that might hinder the exercise of the authority"" of the United Nations Council for Namibia over Namibia. The exploitation of the natural resources of Namibia by South Africa and transnational corporations is a flagrant violation of Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia with a view to halting the pillage of wealth of the people of Namibia. Need we stress that certain economic and military assistance given by Western Powers to the South African regime is an obstacle to the implementation of resolution 3295 (XXIX) of the General Assembly? This support of the South African regime jeopardizes international peace and security  which is already precarious in the region. Therefore  my delegation makes an urgent appeal to all countries to implement the mandatory embargo on the supply of weapons and spare parts to South Africa  in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo in May 1977. In the course of the Conference in Maputo  the international community prepared a programme of action for the liberation of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe; and some progress has already been made along the road to independence for Namibia  thanks to that work.111.	In Zimbabwe the course of events seems to be tending towards decolonization. Thanks to a redoubling of the efforts and an intensification of the armed struggle carried out by the heroic people of Zimbabwe led by the Patriotic Front  the conditions for negotiation on a settlement of the problem seem to have been laid down. In this process of decolonization which has already been begun the Heads of State of the front-line countries  to whom my delegation wishes to pay a sincere tribute  have played a major role. The perseverance of the United Nations has had a profound effect on the United Kingdom  which has at last accepted its responsibility as administering Power: namely  to lead its colony to independence and autonomy.112.	My delegation welcomed the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General entrusted with the task of carrying on negotiations regarding the transition to majority government in Southern Rhodesia. However  the chances of settlement in Zimbabwe cannot blind us to the criminal acts which are daily being carried out by the illegal regime of Ian Smith. That regime  which is illegal  since it is a racist minority  has in fact adopted brutal measures of repression to the point of committing genocide against the people of Zimbabwe. Thousands of villagers have been forcibly herded into concentration camps; innocent people have been struck down  tortured and killed. To carry out their brutal repression against the people of Zimbabwe  the illegal regime is even recruiting mercenaries. Furthermore  the illegal regime has committed acts of aggression against Botswana  Mozambique and Zambia. In the economic field  the illegal minority regime has pillaged the resources of Zimbabwe.113.	In the light of these acts of aggression and. oppression. Member States have no choice but to support the armed struggle of the people of Zimbabwe. In that context  the United Kingdom should act in order to break up .the rebel armed forces of Ian Smith  which have inflicted great loss of life and caused enormous destruction of property both in Zimbabwe and in the neighbouring countries. The special representative of the Secretary-General must also act to redress this situation. It is obvious that it is the armed forces and the police of Ian Smith that must lay down their weapons and not the forces of liberation that will ultimately constitute the regular army of independent Zimbabwe.114.	The Anglo-American plan  which constitutes a sufficient basis for negotiation  can only succeed if it takes into account the positions that were stated by the Patriotic Front in the Security Council recently: namely  the need to disband the forces of repression of Ian Smith  and to exclude him and all his clique from any settlement  as well as the need for guarantees from the administering Power for the transfer of power to the black majority within the limits laid down; that is to say in the course of 1978.115.	In fact  the people of Zimbabwe and the freedom- loving peoples of Africa and the world can no longer allow the Rhodesian racists to carry out their plans and to slow down the victories of the peoples of southern Africa in their efforts to prepare the way for liberation.116.	As long as the regime of Ian Smith stands  the international community must go to the assistance of the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe to allow it to speed up the achievement of its independence. The international community is also in duty bound to strengthen economic ties against the Salisbury regime by resorting to the terms of Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations  in accordance with the Maputo Declaration in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia.117.	At the side of the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe  the people of Burundi is one with the people of the Sahara  which has for years courageously fought against colonialism and for self-determination  independence and national sovereignty. My delegation feels that General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) must be applied to Western Sahara also. That is the only acceptable way in which the Saharan people can continue to make enormous sacrifices to recover their dignity and their freedom under the direction of the Frente POLISARIO. We urge all the countries of the region to act accordingly and to create conditions of peace and co-operation in the region on that basis.118.	Turning to the Comorian island of Mayotte  my delegation feels that the present status of Mayotte is contrary to respect for the territorial integrity of the Comorian Archipelago. This is clearly a colonial situation which must be ended as soon as possible. The problem  which did not exist when the island was a French colony  arose when France laid down principles for elections the results of which might have allowed the peoples of Mayotte to secede from the rest of the Archipelago. The organization of elections on such a basis appears to my delegation to challenge the very principle of the indivisibility and territorial integrity of the Comorian State.119.	My delegation fervently hopes that France  which has emerged honourably from more complex situations in the past  will heed the appeals that have been made by the international community so that the island of Mayotte will return to the Comorian State and thus the basis for co-operation between the Comorians and France will be established and international peace and security will be safeguarded in that region.120.	The manifestations of colonialism are  however  not limited to Africa alone. Colonial situations still persist in Asia and Latin America. Burundi believes that freedom knows no frontiers  and that is why we are at one with peoples struggling for their national independence and dignity  such as the peoples of East Timor and Belize. The treaties on the Panama Canal recently arrived at are an important step towards decolonization and the exercise of sovereignty. That is why my delegation addresses warm congratulations to the people of Panama and its leaders for having achieved a major victory.121.	We wish to seize this opportunity also to encourage the people of the United States of America and its new administration to comply fully with the obligations they have assumed  which are a credit to them. We believe that the decision will be an important milestone in the elimination of the colonial problems that still plague the world.122.	The situation in the Middle East is worsening because of Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories.123.	The creation of new settlements in the occupied territories is a further obstacle to efforts at achieving a just and lasting peace in the region.124.	Despite these encroachments on sovereignty and on fundamental human rights  the delegation of Burundi feels that the Palestine question lies at the very heart of the problems of the Middle East. The people of Palestine should therefore have the right of decision. The delegation of Burundi supports the measures advocated at the extraordinary meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned countries on 30 September 1977 to ensure the settlement of the problem of the Middle East. The Government of the Republic of Burundi is convinced that for a just and lasting peace to be achieved in the area the following principles must be observed: the total withdrawal by Israel of all territories of Arab countries occupied by force since 5 June 1967  including the holy city of Jerusalem; the restoration of all the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine  including their right to return to self-determination and to the creation of an independent State in Palestine; the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization at the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East as the sole representative of the Palestinian people  the people most vitally affected by the problem of the Middle East.125.	The delegation of Burundi urges the General Assembly and the Security Council to call upon Israel to renounce its policy of establishing new settlements and scrupulously to respect the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.126.	The situation in Cyprus also warrants special attention by the international community. The people of Burundi wishes the two communities  both Greek and Turkish  to live in perfect harmony and hopes that the policy of the non-alignment of Cyprus will be safeguarded. Respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity must be ensured by all parties concerned. The delegation of Burundi encourages the efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve an acceptable settlement between the communities of the island.127.	For a long time the Korean nation has aspired to peaceful and independent reunification  but the presence of foreign troops in South Korea constitutes a major obstacle to the achievement of profound and legitimate aspirations. That is why the delegation of Burundi calls again for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.128.	The United Nations must more firmly than in the past endeavour to create conditions more conducive to the reunification for which the Korean people is ready to fight to the bitter end..129.	Guided by the principles of respect for the territorial integrity of countries and non-interference in the domestic affairs of States  the Government of the Republic of Burundi supports the just claims of the people of China to the People's Republic of China.130.	The question of disarmament is of vital importance to the safeguarding and strengthening of international peace and security. A solution of this problem will allow the peoples of our planet to devote themselves to the needs of development and progress. At the present stage of negotiations  however  my delegation notes with regret that little tangible progress has been achieved. On the contrary  new forms of weapons of mass destruction are being perfected and are still appearing as the number of countries capable of achieving nuclear capability constantly grows. Year after year  military budgets increase alarmingly. Each year more than $300 billion is devoted to military expenditures  and a number of experts devote their time to research on more lethal instruments while they could be concerned with proposing new ways of controlling certain phenomena of nature which remain inexplicable  such as droughts  floods and earthquakes  which already cause so much suffering to mankind. The unrestrained arms race leads the delegation of Burundi to feel it is high time to draw up a programme of action to wipe out the spectre of a new world war of annihilation.131.	In this context my Government feels that the United Nations is the right forum for negotiations. As far as principles are concerned  my delegation feels that the problem of disarmament must be examined in all its aspects and that there must be general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The conclusion of a treaty of that kind might well be negotiated within the framework of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  whose mandate could be extended by the General Assembly.132.	As far as specific measures are concerned  the United Nations should encourage the United States and the Soviet Union to continue their strategic arms limitation talks. Pending the conclusion of a treaty on general and complete disarmament  my delegation feels the following measures cc well be taken by all States: first  a solemn commitment not to use nuclear weapons; secondly  the prohibition of the emplacement of new nuclear weapons on the territory of other States; thirdly  the removal of nuclear hardware from the territory of other States; fourthly  the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones of peace and cooperation in different regions of the world; fifthly  the liquidation of military bases located in foreign territories.133.	Obviously  those specific measures cannot be completed until the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. My delegation welcomes the initiative of the Soviet Union concerning the holding of a special session of the General Assembly in 1978.134.	In fact  today more than ever before in history it is important for its salvation that mankind know that peace and welfare can be guaranteed not by the accumulation of nuclear weapons  but only by respecting human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination  independence and economic development.135.	Our Organization's noble objectives-namely international peace and security among others-cannot truly be achieved while the immense majority of mankind wallows in misery and suffers hunger  ignorance  illiteracy and many grave privations. Since every man has a right to welfare and security  economic and social progress seems to be a priority and the way to ensure the exercise of these fundamental rights. Thus  the people of Burundi welcomed with a sense of relief the decisions and recommendations of the General Assembly during its sixth and seventh special sessions. We are gratified at the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.136.	These important steps towards economic liberation  have not  unfortunately  reduced the growing gap between the developed and developing nations. On the contrary  lately the economic and monetary crises have only increased the unsettling effects on the already fragile economies of the developing countries  particularly the less developed and land-locked countries. No effective solution has been found to the problems of basic commodities  debts  balance of payments  protection of purchasing power in the developing countries  trade  the transfer of technology  the constant increase in the flow of tangible resources and access to capital markets.137.	My delegation feels that the Paris Conference was useful in that it provided the elements that should serve as the basis for future negotiations. We thank France for having been host to the Conference. We also appreciate the true worth of the results obtained during the course of that Conference. However  the Government of Burundi shares the conviction of the non-aligned countries that the main cause of the deterioration in international economic relations lies in the absence of political will on the part of certain Powers  clinging as they do to protectionism. At this critical moment in the economic struggle  Burundi is glad it enjoys co-operation and solidarity with the Group of 77  which has prevailed over the divisive manoeuvres indulged in during the difficult negotiations of the North-South Conference and the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.138.	.Burundi upholds the declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the States members of the Group of 77 which met on 29 September 1977 at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York. We are convinced that the establishment of a new international economic order is in the interests of the international community and  therefore  Burundi feels it is imperative to resume negotiations within the framework of the United Nations system  the only appropriate forum fully representative for such purposes. My delegation wishes to draw the attention of the developed countries to the need to provide for the most pressing and particular requirements of the land-locked and most seriously affected countries 139.	It is imperative that concrete and positive results should be arrived at immediately that will lead to justice and equity in our international relations.140.	In this respect  Burundi supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly during 1980 to assess the progress achieved on the tortuous road to the establishment of a new international economic order. We trust that between now and then we will have been able to make further progress in the strengthening of co-operation.141.	My delegation lays great store by co-operation among Member States regardless of their degree of development.142.	While it is true that development is a matter for each country  solidarity is necessary for harmonious development among States. The new regime in Burundi has laid a solid groundwork for that development. In fact  in the first months of its existence  fruitful contacts were established between Burundi and its neighbouring countries  namely  Rwanda  Tanzania and Zaire  in order to create regional groupings for co-operation. The Burundi Government is happy that the decisions adopted by the eminent Heads of State of the region have met the profound aspirations of their people and ours.143.	We are happy to note that these efforts are being endorsed by the United Nations system and by the European Economic Community. The Burundi delegation encourages such initiatives  between developing countries. Thus  the Programme of Action adopted by the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  the Action Programme for Economic Co-operation adopted by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  the report of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries and also the decisions of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD  will clearly guide us all in our future deliberations. In a more specific field  that of the law of the sea  Burundi has followed with interest the negotiations that have taken place in the preparation of an international convention. My delegation believes that it would be regrettable to delay the conclusion of such a convention as thereby the United Nations would forfeit much of its credit and respect. At this stage of negotiations we believe particular attention should be given to the position of the land-locked countries which are equally interested in developing the resources of the high seas  the common heritage of mankind.144.	Thus  the oceans and seas will no longer be an arena for armed confrontation but will become vast fields for co-operation and peace. Within that context  my delegation wishes to state that we support the just demands of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean  who adjure the international community to make of it a zone of peace and co-operation.145.	In the course of this statement  at no time I trust have I ceased to stress the outstanding role that the United Nations must and should play in international relations. This is due to a large extent to the faith that the people of Burundi have placed in this great world Organization. This confidence is due also to the scope of the problems that should be solved by peaceful means. The United Nations doubtless is the most appropriate forum for the settlement of those questions that touch on the future of the peoples of the world. Peoples struggling for their independence and dignity turn their eyes to our Organization. The people of Palestine inquire of this Organization regarding their future. The search for a world of justice and equity hinges on our Organization. Over the years our Organization has achieved enormous scope.146.	The question arises  however  of whether the sharp problems that face our Organization can be solved despite the contradictions inherent in its component parts. In the past  it has been surprising to see that two important bodies of our Organization  namely  the General Assembly and the Security Council  have been unable to take the same stand on situations that threaten international peace and security  including such questions as decolonization  apartheid  the Middle East and Viet Nam.147.	The international community has witnessed the improper use of the right of veto by one or another of the members of the Security Council. Today  because of the exaggerated prerogatives enjoyed by the permanent members  the decisions of the General Assembly are blocked. Convinced that .this situation will not find any solution based upon the present provisions of the Charter  the Government of Burundi feels that the moment has come for a democratization of international relations by a revision of the Charter and bearing in mind the need to abolish the right of veto.148.	In so doing  we shall have laid a solid basis for equity and justice in international relations. We will have safeguarded also the very foundations of our Organization. We will have rekindled for succeeding generations the torch of San Francisco  the torch of equality  friendship and solidarity among peoples. "
"9",478,"BEL",32,1977,"﻿39.	 Mr. President  chance and the rule of alphabetical order have led to a situation in which I am speaking to you today as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium  as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community and as President of European political co-operation. In my first capacity I have the privilege of performing a particularly pleasant task: I should like to extend to you our heartiest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second General Assembly and to tell you how very pleased we are that you are presiding over this Assembly.40.	I should also like to assure the Secretary-General of our full support for his efforts in the service of the United Nations  and compliment him on the lucidity and conscientiousness with which he discharges his lofty responsibilities.41.	In view of the extraordinary range of cultures  traditions  races  religions  beliefs and ideologies that make up our international society  it is evident that only universal co-operation which unites all members of the international community can create the conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for ensuring relations among our peoples based on mutual understanding and a common will to p.  ct peace. This is the essential role of the United Nations.42.	I am very pleased  first  on behalf of the nine members of the European Community  to welcome two new Members into our midst: the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. On this occasion I am pleased to convey my warmest congratulations to them.43.	For 25 years now  certain countries of Western Europe have been trying to apply the lessons of history by establishing a durable peace among themselves and by creating the conditions necessary for the improvement of the well-being of their peoples. That is the goal which the European Community has set for itself. Little by little  co-operation among the members of the Community has been established and is continuing to grow. But this task would be insufficient if the European Community did not participate  as effectively as possible  in the safeguarding of peace in the world and in the struggle against underdevelopment.44.	Beyond ideological conflicts there must exist ways and means of conducting among nations fruitful dialogues that will bring nearer these two objectives which we consider essential. The nations of the European Community have no intention of shirking their responsibilities  and they intend to play their proper role in the international community. The nine members of the European Community made their common views in this regard quite clear in the statement by the European Council issued on 17 July 1975. A copy of this declaration was sent to all the Members of the United Nations.45.	The nine States put their principles into practice in the Lome Convention by establishing a balanced framework for co-operation and by instituting a dialogue on a new basis with a number of African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. Much still needs to be done  but we are determined to continue along this path in order to find equitable solutions.46.	In addition to this regional approach  the nine members of the European Community intend to act on a more global scale by co-operating with all the developing countries. Our system of generalized preferences is the first step in this direction. We reaffirm our will to achieve a structural improvement in the position of the developing countries in the world economy.47.	The Community is fully aware of its particular obligations. It will continue  to the extent of its means  to give aid in the form of food and materials to countries suffering from extreme poverty and to peoples afflicted by war and natural catastrophes. Its member States reaffirm their will to increase their aid to development effectively and substantially and better to balance their efforts in this respect.48.	In co-operation with developing countries  they are determined to devote a progressively more important part of their efforts to programmes intended to satisfy the essential needs of man. In order that all developing countries benefit from this new orientation  the nine countries have also agreed to examine the size and the allocation of the aid to development with a view to increasing the volume and the effectiveness of the aid in the framework of an enlarged international effort.49.	At this point I would like to address myself to certain current situations which deserve the special attention of this Assembly. The problem of the Middle East will be the first that I will take up.50.	Anything that affects the stability and prosperity of the countries of Africa and the Middle East is of the greatest interest to the nine countries. We have close historical ties with these countries which are deepening in all fields of human endeavour.51.	With regard to the situation in the Middle East  over which the nine countries continue to be gravely concerned  we remain convinced  as a matter of principle  that any solution must be based on Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973)  as we reaffirmed 29 June 1977  as well as on the following fundamental principles: first  acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable; secondly  Israel must end its occupation of territories it has held since the 1967 war; thirdly  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and the independence of each State in the region must be respected  as well as the right of each State in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized borders; fourthly  the establishment of a just and lasting peace must take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.52.	The nine countries also continue to believe that a solution to the conflict will not be possible unless the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to give effective expression to its national identity becomes a reality. This would take into account  of course  the need for a homeland for the Palestinian people.53.	It remains the firm view of the nine countries that all of these elements constitute an indivisible whole.54.	The nine countries consider that the representatives of the parties to the conflict  including the Palestinian people  must participate in the negotiations in an appropriate manner  to be worked out in consultation among all the parties concerned. In the context of an over-all settlement  Israel must be ready to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people; similarly  the Arab side must be ready to recognize the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.55.	Speaking practically  the nine countries are prepared to co-operate  to the extent desired by the interested parties  in the search for a general and definitive solution  and to implement this  notably through participation in the context of the United Nations in guarantees that they consider of the greatest importance for a general solution of the problems of the Middle East.56.	One should recall here that the nine countries have publicly stated their concern over the illegal measures taken recently by the Government of Israel in the occupied territories  which will be the subject of a new item on the agenda of our Assembly. These measures are contrary to the basic principles which I have just set forth. Moreover    they constitute an additional obstacle in the process of negotiation which should lead to a peaceful solution.57.	Looking forward to peace negotiations  the nine countries reaffirm the concern they have expressed on many occasions that the parties to the conflict should refrain from making any statements or adopting any measures  administrative  legal  military or otherwise  which would constitute an obstacle to the process of peace.58.	Moreover  the nine countries reaffirm their continuing support for Lebanon's independence and territorial integrity. They deplore the fact that the southern portion of the country should be the scene of bloodshed  endangering the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East  and they call upon all parties concerned to halt the fighting.59.	The efforts made by the United Nations to find a solution to the question of Cyprus are well known. I should like to reaffirm the support of the nine countries for the efforts which the Secretary-General is making in accordance with the mandate he received from our Organization. The nine countries believe that everything must be done to search for a negotiated settlement which would be both lasting and fair through consultations between the two communities.60.	In this respect  I recall that on 18 February 1977 the nine countries stated their satisfaction on the subject of the Nicosia meeting. They hoped that conversations between the two communities will resume as quickly as possible in the same spirit which inspired that meeting. They reaffirm their support of the principle of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.61.	Through appropriate steps  the nine countries continue to urge all parties concerned to pursue their consultations.62.	I believe that a statement by the nine countries would be impossible without a detailed reference to the subject of apartheid.63.	As you are well aware  we remain firmly opposed to all forms of racial discrimination  wherever it exists. At the Lagos Conference I had the opportunity to express the position of the nine countries concerning the policy of apartheid. We condemn apartheid and reject it as an insult to the dignity of man and as a form of institutionalized racism that deprives the majority of the population of their full civil and political rights.64.	The events of the past year have demonstrated the growing frustration of the black population and the intransigence of the South African Government.65.	The nine countries consider that the bantustan  policy  far from solving the problems posed by apartheid as the Government claims  is in fact a means of perpetuating it.66.	Finally  I should like to point out that the nine countries recently decided to examine a variety of different actions they could take to bring the collective influence of the Community to bear on South Africa to put an end to apartheid. Thus the nine countries have recently adopted a code of conduct for all their firms with subsidiaries  branches or representation in South Africa. The publication of this code constitutes a first measure among others which are still being examined. We will do everything possible to try to bring about a non-racial government in South Africa that will permit the people of that country as a whole to participate fully in the life of the nation.67.	We declared at the Maputo Conference  as well as the message issued on the occasion of Namibia Day  that we support the right of the peoples of Rhodesia and Namibia to self-determination  to independence and to the enjoyment of the fundamental rights defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.68.	Concerning Namibia  it is our position that the Namibians should be able to exercise these rights in a democratic fashion under the supervision of the United Nations and that ail political groups should be able to participate  including the South West Africa People's Organization. Any solution of the Namibian problem must be based on Security Council resolution 385 (1976). That is why the nine countries express the hope that efforts currently under way will lead to success.69.	Some valuable progress has already been made. This may be a unique opportunity for bringing about a peaceful and early transition to independence  and the nine countries members of the Community stand ready to assist in this process in any way they can.70.	It is now more urgent than ever before to settle the Rhodesian issue. It seems to us essential to use every possible means to bring to an end a conflict which could have repercussions throughout Africa and to bring about  after a peaceful transition  independence for Zimbabwe in 1978 on the basis of majority rule.71.	We commend the efforts being made at present to achieve an early settlement along these lines  while observing strictly the obligations resulting from the Charter in regard to sanctions.72.	In order for Zimbabwe to develop normally there will be a need for economic assistance to help provide a solution to the basic problems with which this new State will find itself confronted after the disappearance of the illegal minority regime. The members of the Community are prepared to consider carefully and sympathetically proposals that have already been made for the creation of a Zimbabwe development fund.73.	This brings me to a few thoughts on the subject of Africa in general.74.	The African continent is seeking stability. Africa must find this stability as well as its own identity. We know that this is the objective of all the African peoples  which is why I am eager to reiterate the position of the nine countries in this regard. The nine countries strongly reject any intervention by any State which seeks to establish a zone of influence on the African continent. It is the African States  and the African States alone  that must find the solutions to their own problems.75.	Recent painful events in the Horn of Africa underline the importance of this principle of non-intervention. Any aid given to Africa must be aid that the nations of Africa desire  and it must be given under conditions that the Africans themselves have determined are in their best interest.76.	I should like now to devote a few minutes to a problem which is of concern to all Europeans and  beyond them  to the entire world.77.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is  the Community feels  an essential element in the broader question of detente. The Final Act of that Conference  signed in Helsinki on 1 August 1975 is in particular a major contribution to the efforts aimed at the consolidation of peace within the international community. This document must be considered as a whole  and each of its parts must be correctly implemented  lest it not answer the hopes it has raised.78.	A precise and logical working plan defined during the preparatory meeting should allow the meeting at Belgrade  which will examine the follow-up of the Conference in a few days' time  to look at each of the themes of the Final Act  with respect both to their implementation in the past and to the stimulation of this implementation in the future.79.	Having spoken briefly about security  I should like now to comment on economic problems and in particular international economic relations. One of the tasks of the current session of the General Assembly will be to evaluate progress made in international co-operation and to determine how this co-operation should develop in the years ahead.80.	A great deal was said on this subject here a few days ago; but our task during the next three months is more ambitious and perhaps more difficult. The Community feels that real progress has been made recently in the field of international economic co-operation. In this respect  the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation has undeniably produced results—limited perhaps but certainly positive—in a number of important areas-. The Community will see to it that the agreements reached at Paris are implemented in the near future.81.	However  I do not want to express feelings of unmitigated satisfaction  for we wish to remain realistic and recognize the aspirations of the international community for a new international economic order. The European Community remains convinced of the need to bring about a fundamental improvement in the position of developing countries in the world economy  taking into account the problems of the least developed countries. If I am not pessimistic  it is because the international community has made significant efforts in a number of important sectors to narrow differences and reconcile diverse interests. A case in point is represented by the many ongoing negotiations this year  such as those on an integrated programme for commodities and on a common fund. In those areas solutions are within reach  and the Community will continue to participate in those discussions with an open mind  seeking tangible solutions.82.	Circumstances or the economic climate tend sometimes to interfere with good intentions and hamper our lines of action. The Community is not immune to the difficulties currently being faced by many nations. It has been struggling  like many other countries  with the problems of inflation and unemployment. The joint efforts which the Member States make to maintain an adequate level of economic activity  and even induce proper growth  meet with difficulties which are not amenable to solution. In some sectors of the economy those difficulties have recently become exacerbated and no immediate or permanent cure is in sight.83.	Nevertheless  if the Community must try to protect its own internal equilibrium—which has a considerable impact on harmonious world-wide economic relations—it does not choose to withdraw within itself. The concept of integration is the basis of the Community  as is its overture to the world at large.84.	We understand the problems resulting from the present economic climate  but we do not accept protectionism as a means of defence. Therefore  the Community will continue to contribute substantially to the multilateral trade negotiations within GATT  and it hopes that these talks will yield concrete results that will satisfy the developing countries in particular.85.	The Community has established a world-wide network of agreements on association and co-operation. Some of those formulas for co-operation  which I have already mentioned  were genuine innovations. But we intend to go further. The Lome Convention was followed  in 1976  by the signing of a new series of agreements with the countries of the Maghreb and the Middle East.86.	We also hope that during the meeting which is to be held in Brussels from 26 to 28 October  the dialogue between the nine members of the Community and the members of the League of Arab States will yield concrete results of a definite interest to all participants.87.	With regard to the Mediterranean countries  the Community  in 1972  adopted a policy of global approach. That has taken shape through a series of new contractual agreements  linking the Community to practically every Mediterranean country. This has been in the interest of all countries concerned  in the interests of development and  therefore  of stability in that sensitive part of the world. This regional approach has been complemented by a global policy in favour of developing countries as a whole. In this regard  the scheme of generalized preferences for 1977 has been substantially improved in comparison with that of last year. New orientations have been given to food aid. In general  efforts are being made to ensure the co-ordination and harmonization of policies of development co-operation within the Community.88.	I mention these accomplishments without smugness  fully aware that they can be perfected  and may be deemed inadequate by some United Nations Members.89.	I am also pleased to note  furthermore  that contacts between the Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance are developing.90.	Finally  we are also very pleased with recent progress towards the negotiation of a trade agreement with the People's Republic of China  which I hope will soon materialize.91.	In the efforts of the international community for the restructuring of international economic relations  we are convinced that the United Nations will inevitably play a fundamental role. The Community attaches great importance to the work being done in United Nations forums. It will continue its efforts to make a positive contribution. It wants to reiterate its desire to co-operate and to avoid a climate of confrontation which could only harm the international community as a whole. In this respect  we have been able to witness  in particular during the seventh special session of the Assembly  how a spirit of dialogue can prevail over confrontation. We cannot make real progress by opposing each other or through plans too far removed from the reality of our economic structure.92.	In this spirit of realism and without excluding the desire to redress any imbalances  we should turn our thoughts to the contents of the new strategy for development  which will unquestionably be one of the major future tasks in the achievement of the objectives of a new international economic order.93.	If the nine countries are desirous of establishing peace in the world  as well as bringing about a more equitable society  they wish at the same time to make a contribution to the increasingly effective protection of human rights both in the civil and political and in the economic  social and cultural fields.94.	The members of the Community share the feeling  which you yourself  Mr. President  expressed at the beginning of our work  that human rights comprise economic  social and cultural rights  as well as civil and political rights  and that they are  interdependent and indivisible.95.	It is evident that peace  justice and equity are inconceivable without the guarantee provided by human rights against the abuses of arbitrariness and all forms of exploitation.96.	Public opinion knows that this is an essential matter and that it is the duty of Governments and of the United Nations to provide adequate answers.97.	The nine countries are pleased with the progress that has been made by the international community in the field of human rights. The United Nations plays a key role in this area. But its task is still far from completed. During the course of this session  the General Assembly will turn its attention to a number of initiatives aimed at further safeguarding and implementing human rights.98.	Some of those initiatives are concerned with specific rights and their particular implementation. This is notably the case with the initiative concerning the taking of hostages. We express the hope that those who are participating in work which may lead to the drafting of a convention in this field will be inspired by the necessary political determination. That is why we favour the prolongation of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  which was created for this purpose at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.99.	Other initiatives are aimed at strengthening the machinery by which human rights in general are implemented. Finally  another category seeks to re-establish respect for human rights in special situations where those rights seem to be scoffed of.100.	It is the intention of the nine countries to examine these initiatives according to their merits and the extent to which they are likely to achieve their aims.101.	We hope that  beyond differing doctrines and political systems  this session of the General Assembly will find it possible to achieve what must be our true objective: namely  to give man his rightful place in the world and to ensure that terror  oppression and injustice become mere curiosities to be found in the textbooks of history.102.	In conclusion. I should like to add to the observations that I have just made in my capacity as the representative of the country which currently holds the presidency of the European Community a few thoughts as Minister for Foreign Affairs for Belgium.103.	The occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations gave each of us an opportunity to reflect on the nature of this Organization  the way it operates  and the hopes for its future. In the report on the work of the Organization which he has just submitted to the present session  the Secretary-General has described the current situation of the United Nations. I should like to applaud his ceaseless efforts and tell him how much Belgium agrees with his analysis. The report  of course  reflects certain worries  but it also reflects the hope and conviction that must be at the heart of all our actions.104.	Like all human endeavours  our Organization is not perfect. But rather than stressing its weaknesses and opting for fatalism or despair  is it not our duty to support the efforts that are daily undertaken to strengthen the role that it can and must play? Today  more than ever  the United Nations is necessary and indispensable. It represents hope for many nations. It must be the supreme resort  the guardian of the law the international community has established for itself  and the light that guides our steps through trial and distress.105.	Over the past 30 years  the number of United Nations Members has tripled  and we are thus coming closer each day to the ideal of universality which we all share. The activities of our Organization also have multiplied  particularly in the fields of social and economic development  to which we shall be dedicating more than $1 billion next year. This is only a part of the funds that Member States will make available to about 20 organizations and institutions that are today part of the United Nations system.106.	In short  the modest undertaking of Lake Success has been transformed into an assembly of organizations for which it is imperative to harmonize objectives and co-ordinate efforts.107.	My country firmly supports measures to promote concerted action within the United Nations system and to increase the effectiveness of our Organization.108.	To achieve these goals  we must strive daily for a better definition of priorities  an integrated planning of programmes and the encouragement of a policy of economy and budgetary restraint that will allow a larger portion of available resources to be dedicated to projects of particular benefit to developing nations.109.	Some progress has been made in these efforts over the past two years. The biennial budget proposed by the Secretary-General makes this quite clear.110.	However  the transformation of the world and the urgency of its needs require more. It is necessary  indeed  to effect a major restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system  and for the past two years this has been the objective of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System  created by the General Assembly.111.	Beyond these basic concerns of administration and effectiveness  we must also reflect on the role and actions of our Organization. Although  strictly speaking  the Organization deals with States  its ultimate objective remains the destiny of man.112.	World opinion has shown the way by treating human rights more and more as one of its essential concerns.113.	Our Organization already boasts considerable achievements in this field  but in application they all too often remain a dead letter.114.	Our prime role is to ensure their application in practice  and in that connexion  the Belgian delegation would like to remind this forum of the proposal it made a year ago in the context of Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII).7115.	The funeral of Mr. Steven Biko yesterday in King William's Town is a tragic reminder of the fate both of the victims of the flagrant breach of human rights represented by apartheid  and of the political prisoners in all parts of the world which are a reproach to the conscience of mankind. I pay homage here to Mr. Biko's memory.116.	But we will not have fully respected the ultimate objective of our .Organization if we limit our concern for mankind to the promotion and defence of human rights  however important this aspect of our activities may be.117.	One of our major preoccupations must be to find solutions for problems concerned with the maintenance of international peace and security. This is a broad field  ranging from the control  limitation and reduction of the use of weapons to the solution of regional disputes.118.	In this context  the problems of disarmament require an integrated approach based not only on measures for control and reduction of armaments  but also on a parallel strengthening of the means for the pacific settlement of disputes.119.	This is a vast undertaking. In a world still dominated essentially by the balance of power and by ideological conflicts  international relations are still  and will long remain  marked by mistrust and by the fear that a shift in the balance of power will lead to an arms race. Detente remains precarious and fragile  and the efforts to strengthen international security have undoubtedly been greater than the results achieved.120.	However  the disparity between the enormity of the task and the relative paucity of results should not induce us to relax our efforts.121.	Have we not seen  since the 1960s  the beginnings of an international legislation in arms control? Discussions and negotiations are more active now than ever in such essential fields as non-proliferation  Ike complete halting of nuclear tests and the banning of chemical weapons.122.	Regional and bilateral efforts  such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and those on balanced reductions of conventional forces in Central Europe have also been undertaken and deserve the encouragement of all countries.123.	Unquestionably  there is a new awareness in the world in this sphere; disarmament has become a universal concern  notwithstanding the special duties and obligations of the great Powers.124.	This state of mind augurs well for the next special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament. That session could be an important landmark on the road to general  complete and controlled disarmament  provided  of course  that all major military Powers be included  beginning with the nuclear military Powers. It will be important to avoid dogma and to stay clear of the dangers of pursuing sterile perfectionism.125.	It is within this essentially pragmatic and concrete context that my country intends to propose a study  based on ideas put forward last year  to evaluate the possibilities offered by the regional approach. The regional approach is in no way intended to replace the global approach  but rather to complement it in the fields of nuclear and conventional arms.126.	Indeed  circumstances in a given region could favour certain specific measures which might be inapplicable in other regions or on a world-wide scale. In general  it is easier to approach the complex problems of disarmament and arms control at the regional level involving a group of States rather than attempt a general approach at the world level.127.	On the other hand  some questions require a universal solution. I am thinking in particular of the problem of nuclear non-proliferation.128.	Few problems create such near unanimity concerning the principle  and such discord concerning the solution. Why? The answer is simple. While everyone agrees in denouncing the risks of nuclear proliferation  the implementation of a policy of non-proliferation brings into conflict  as in other areas of international life  the  haves  and the  have-nots ; those countries which already possess nuclear weapons  and therefore certain techniques and nuclear potentialities  confront those which have no nuclear weapons; those which have nuclear technology confront those which do not; while the producers of essential fuels confront those where no such fuels are found.129.	Respect for the principle of non-proliferation therefore impels a solution to these problems  and the internationalisation of nuclear resources.130.	All current and future civilian nuclear technology  as well as all necessary equipment and fuel  must be available equally to every one of us  without discrimination between those who possess nuclear weapons and those who not only do not yet possess them but have voluntarily renounced their use in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.131.	This Treaty has imposed an infinitely greater sacrifice of sovereignty on those signatories that have no nuclear weapons than on their partners which do possess them.132.	If  as seems to be the case  it is now necessary to go beyond the Treaty further to protect mankind from the dangers of nuclear proliferation  it is necessary for the States whose armed forces possess nuclear weapons this time to set an example of sacrifice by committing themselves to equal access for all to nuclear technology  equipment and fuels.133.	Such must be the basis of the action of the United Nations  as well as the nuclear States  which should set an example by resolutely engaging in a discussion leading to serious and substantive measures of nuclear disarmament.134.	I have had occasion to refer to our preoccupation and that of our partners in the European Community with regard to the great problems in international affairs. It seems essential to me that these problems be approached in a spirit of mutual goodwill and understanding of each other's needs  and that spirit must reign in the United Nations.135.	If we work in that spirit there is only one path that we can follow: we must redouble our confidence in the United Nations and more than ever before stride forward seeking the just and durable peace that all the peoples of the world expect."
"10",524,"BEN",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Once again I am moved by the feelings of anxiety and doubt  but also of hope  that I have so often had when it has been my lot to address the representatives in this Assembly from this high rostrum.2.	I feel anxiety when I consider not only the number but above all the importance of the questions on our agenda  questions which in many cases concern threats to international peace and security  many of them challenges to the conscience of the world  many of them challenges to the international community which it has so far been incapable of tackling whether through impotence  indifference or  above all  egoism.3.	I feel doubt because our Assembly has been stilled and our lyrical transports are over  what will become of the fine resolutions that we have so cleverly concocted and adopted by all  sometimes with who knows what ulterior motives? For while it is our business to spirit away these dangers we have to note that it is precisely and above all those who have the means to take up these challenges who refuse to do so through either selfishness or political blindness.4.	I feel nope  too  because  despite these negative feelings and the gravity of the threats which hover over our heads  what prevails with me in the final analysis is a deep-seated feeling of optimism  which is justified by the great book of history  iii which the victory of oppressed peoples has never been other than the outcome of struggle—a struggle against ignorance  a struggle against obscurantism  a struggle against egoism  a struggle also for freedom  a struggle for dignity and a struggle for the prosperity of peoples.5.	It is to continue this struggle that representatives are once again met here in this hall  the representatives of all the independent sovereign States of the world  to try to find the solutions of worthy and civilized men to the numerous problems created by those for whom sovereignty  independence  dignity and civilization are meaningless unless they car. dominate  oppress and exploit others 6.	The thirty-second session of the General Assembly of our Organization is beginning its work at a time when international imperialism threatens international peace and security on every front. The year 1977 will go down in history as the year in which multiple acts of aggression were perpetrated by international imperialism against the independence and sovereignty of our States and as the year in which the weakest were crushed without appeal by the strongest and the poorest by the wealthiest.7.	For its part the People's Republic of Benin will never forget the ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of 16 January 1977 against its people and its revolution by a horde of mercenaries trained  equipped and paid to commit the most abject mass crimes. On that day the entire world learned with astonishment that in the middle of the twentieth century there could once again be acts of gangsterism which  although committed with the most modern and sophisticated means  none the less belonged to an age which had vanished for ever. Nevertheless  on that day  through that barbarous and ignoble act of aggression  Benin  in addition to suffering considerable material damage  was to lose seven of its best sons.8.	Coming after the aggressions against Guinea and Angola  that act of aggression was nothing other than the setting in .motion of the same wide-ranging plot hatched by the imperialist Powers against regimes whose only crime was the desire to live in freedom and independence and to be masters of their own natural resources.9.	If the question of the aggression mounted against the People's Republic of Benin gave rise to long and passionate debates in the Security Council  the consideration of the question is no less topical now. Although those debates helped to clarify the nature of the new threat to the independence of the peoples of the third world constituted by the use of international mercenaries  no practical action was recommended for its elimination. Aid while those debates  in the light of the various report? of the commissions of inquiry  had made it possible to unmask those who instigated that barbarism organized on an international scale  nevertheless they did not lead to the adoption of vigorous measures to prevent a recurrence  as required by the consistent and diligent implementation of the United Nations Charter.10.	The phenomenon of internal mercenaries should lead the international community to consider with the greatest seriousness the problem of the security of small States and to recommend effective means of really combating this new  form of modern invasion and colonial and neo-colonial conquest. As our great comrade in arms President Mathieu Kerekou has so judiciously stated:""The recent experience of our country  the People's Republic of Benin  in its resistance to aggression by the imperialist army of mercenaries has enabled us  with documentary support  to draw two fundamental lessons. First  the mercenaries  who are the dregs of a capitalist society already in an advanced state of decay  are in truth special and anonymous detachments of the regular troops of the imperialist armies  since they are recruited  led  trained and armed by regular officers specially assigned to that sordid task. One cannot therefore but denounce and combat the use of international mercenaries without unmasking the forces which organize and arm them  set them in motion and assign them their clear-cut targets.""In the second place  the use of armed groups of mercenaries is a new weapon of mass destruction which has entered into the global strategy of international imperialism for the colonial reconquest of the States of the third world. Consequently  all States must become fully aware of this menace and must organize themselves in order to carry on a resolute and sustained struggle against the new fold of blood-thirsty conquerors. This ongoing struggle against international mercenaries has become an essential and urgent task for all progressive mankind.""46.	I do not wish to reiterate here the disgust which was felt by the entire people of Benin at the participation of a colonial Power which vaunts itself as a land of freedom  equality and fraternity; neither shall I describe again the repulsion experienced by the entire people of Benin when they learned the infamous news that African Governments  Governments of fraternal countries  had  in a cowardly and perfidious fashion  made available to the mercenaries their training camps  their aircraft  their air fields and their men. That is to say that the cowardly act of aggression committed on Sunday  16 January  against the people of Benin and its revolution would never have taken place if African puppets had not agreed to serve as middlemen. Once the Security Council had recognized the tragic events of 16 January 1977 as an act of aggression   it should have been logical for resolution 405(1977) to identify and condemn those responsible for that act of aggression.47.	Be that as it may  the leaders of the imperialist Powers  like the .renegade African Governments that have betrayed the cause of Africa  will none the less remain covered with opprobrium until such time as the just anger of their people casts them one by one on the trash heap of history. For its part  the People's Republic of Benin  in its serene determination to continue its forward march  has the calm satisfaction of having helped through its victory over international imperialism to show States of the third world beset by exploitation and foreign domination  the road they should follow  and of having demonstrated to the imperialist Powers the fate reserved to their enterprises of colonial or neo-colonial reconquest. Nevertheless  we remain convinced that the struggle continues  because imperialism will never accept final defeat; but victory  our victory  is no less certain.48.	It is this certainty of the inevitable victory of oppressed peoples which  despite the rising wave of danger and of barbarous crimes committed by international imperialism on our continent  justifies my delegation's optimism. The revolutionary gale that is blowing over our great  beautiful and rich continent of Africa is blowing harder with each day that passes  sweeping away one by one the last bastions of colonialism and neo-colonialism  as well as the citadels of imperialist-racist fascism  which have been shaken to their foundations by the great popular mass movements  of which Soweto is the living symbol.49.	It is fortunate that  after 12 years of guilty inaction and a silence of complicity  the British Government has at last decided to shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. It has been necessary  in order to shake the Western Powers out of their stubborn indifference to the exactions and the denials of rights visited on the people of Zimbabwe  for the freedom fighters under the leadership of the Patriotic Front to strike a blow at the illegal regime of Ian Smith that endangered its sordid interests in the region. The inevitable victory of the Zimbabwe people thus explains the feverish desperation of the imperialist Powers to find hybrid solutions which will safeguard their selfish interests. The latest plan proposed for the settlement of this problem  though it represents progress over the political blindness which had previously characterized the various positions taken by the imperialist Powers  nevertheless is not a settlement of the fundamental problem  which is that of dissolving the rebel army of Ian Smith  or of the no less fundamental one of the transfer of power to the lawful representatives of the Zimbabwe people  namely  those who  on the battlefield  are leading the freedom struggle under the enlightened leadership of the Patriotic Front.50.	This is to say that it is first and foremost the Patriotic Front  which is the authentic representative of the Zimbabwe people  which should express its views of the Anglo-American proposals. No one else  no matter how well-intentioned and no matter what sacrifices they have made or may yet make to assist the people of Zimbabwe  can make decisions on its behalf.51.	The same applies to the problem of Namibia. There again  the intensification of the armed struggle under the firm guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization has compelled five Western members of the Security Council to undertake negotiations with the racist Vorster regime for a so-called ""peaceful"" settlement of the Namibian problem. That settlement will be nothing more than a gross sell-out of the legitimate interests of the Namibian people if it fails to take into account the views of SWAPO. That plan must necessarily include the implementation of resolution 385(1976) of the Security Council  which stipulates as a pre-condition to the free elections to be conducted under United Nations supervision the withdrawal of the illegal administration of South Africa and  in particular  the withdrawal of its forces of repression from Namibian territory and the unconditional release of all Namibian political prisoners.52.	The certain victory of the people of Azania  inevitable because it is in the direction in which history is moving  cannot  however  leave us indifferent to the rising danger represented by the increasing military and nuclear potential of South Africa. It has today been duly established that base commercial considerations have impelled a certain colonial Power to assist South Africa to acquire not only the capacity to manufacture the most up-to-date weapons  but also atomic weapons.53.	And yet that country  which in so doing was cynically flouting the various resolutions of our Organization  is well aware of the ignominious and barbarically repressive policy that those weapons are destined to buttress. It is true that for that Government  as for many others  there will never be a more hateful crime against the human race than that which they suffered at the hands of the Nazis during the Second World War. It is true that the Nazi crimes were perpetrated against white  civilized Europe. Those of the Smith and Vorster clique are  of course  committed against blacks  whom civilized Europe had long reduced to slavery. And was it not the slavery of the latter which has always served as the foundation for the wealth of the former?54.	But how do the; crimes committed every day in Soweto and in the gaols of Vorster differ from those committed in the Nazi concentration camps? How was the murder of the patriotic leader Steven Biko less odious than the summary executions of the French resistance forces by the Nazis? How are they less repugnant? Or how is it they deserve no more than hypocritical protests  rather than a general call to arms and consistent action on the part of the great Powers? Europe and America made common cause against Nazi racism. But today  in southern Africa  yesterday's allies have become the accomplices of Boer racism. Yet we should ""remind ourselves that Africa  which today continues to suffer under Boer racism  sacrificed some of the bravest of its sons so that Europe should not today have to live under the Nazi boot. Africa shed its blood so that the Jew who today persists in according to the Palestinian people nothing more than the existence of wanderers should not continue to suffer the horrors of Hitlerite Nazism55.	It is certainly useful to say here that the so-called final solution-the solution of total extermination  so unjustly applied to the American Indians  the very same solution attempted against those who illegally occupy the Arab territories and who are Vorster's main allies—that solution could not be the fate of the peoples of Africa even though today's racists will be equipped with the most modern atomic bomb. It is that same racist policy which underlies the intransigence of Israel in various attempts at settlement of the Middle East problem  despite the many relevant resolutions adopted by both our Organization and by other international bodies.56.	Because it enjoys the unconditional support of the imperialist Powers  Israel persists in blocking every just means of reaching the negotiating table. Because the many crimes it has thus far committed have remained unpunished  Israel persists in remaining deaf to the various peace proposals designed to put an end to the painful and tragic trials which have brought such disruption and sorrow to Lebanon and  above all  to finding just and humane solutions to the Palestinian problem  solutions demanded by the entire international community. And yet the whole world has recognized the justice of the Palestinian cause. Those who have been condemned to be  as it were  eternal wanderers  those who could live only on international charity  have little by little acquired the status of men through their struggle  their fight  their sacrifices. Today they have succeeded in securing recognition by the whole world of their most elementary and legitimate right: their right to a homeland This recognition should be given practical effect; that is to say  the famous Security Council resolution 242(1967) should be amended to take due account of the right of the Palestinian people to form a free  independent and sovereign nation. Because they are assured of the support of certain Powers and  above all  of the inability of our Organization firmly to face up to the violation of the principles of our Charter  Israel is carrying its brazen intransigence to the point of setting up Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories  thus modifying the geographical structure  the composition of the population  and the legal status of those territories  in deliberate violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the resolutions of our Organization. This new step on the part of Israel is not only likely to aggravate the Middle East crisis  but it represents  above all  a threat to international peace. It is insufficient  therefore  merely to adopt resolutions condemning Israel. Our Organization must take the necessary strong measures to bring to reason that State  which is insolently trampling underfoot the principles of our Organization.57.	Thus  when it adopted that resolution in 1967  the international Organization took one decisive step towards the legitimate recognition of the national rights of the Palestinians. Today  by amending that resolution 242 (1967) to take account of relationships in today's world  the community will be concentrating its tireless efforts on a just solution to the Palestinian problem.58.	Although the struggle being waged by the peoples of the world against international imperialism has not yet come to an end  new conquering and expansionist States  no less barbarous and cynical than those of the past  have arisen  such as Morocco  Mauritania  Indonesia and many others.59.	While in Korea an international imperialism  through delaying tactics  continues to oppose the implementation of the resolution adopted in 1975 calling for the withdrawal of all military forces so as to enable the Korean people to achieve their unification through peaceful means  in East Timor  in the south Moluccas and in Western Sahara  the sordid interests of the traditional exploiters are combined now with the no less sordid interests of the new invaders.60.	Thus  despite the unequivocal position taken by our Organization at the last session  Indonesian troops continue their occupation of East Timor.61.	It is the same policy of expansion and practical annexation  practised by Indonesia  which underlies the desperate acts of the Moluccan nationalists  who had no other way of altering the conscience of our Organization to the situation which has been theirs for the past 27 years.62.	Nevertheless  strongly committed to the self- determination of peoples though we are  our revolutionary Marxist-Leninist convictions constrain us to dissociate ourselves from all acts of pointless violence perpetrated against innocent populations who are not responsible for the acts of barbarism  domination and exploitation of other peoples.63.	Our Organization therefore has a duty to reopen the case of the South Moluccas and  as in the case of East Timor  to take the necessary just measures.64.	In the Western Sahara  two States Members of our Organization are coldly engaging in the genocide of a people under the indifferent eyes of the community of nations. Trampling underfoot the pertinent resolutions of the Organization  the decadent feudal regime of Hassan II  in an unnatural  alliance with the rotten regime of Moktar Ould Daddah  forgetting the recent history of its own independence and the formation of its own State and the recent history of the anti-colonialist struggle of the valiant Mauritanian people  has embarked on the bloody enterprise of enslaving the Saharan people. In this mad military venture  these arch-reactionary feudal-bourgeois regimes are enjoying the obvious protection of the capitalist West  whose conscience and moral virtues  here as in southern Africa  are cynically and systematically stifled by the lust for profit  sordid calculation  and the stubborn will to hegemony and domination in the area.65.	It took heavy fighting in certain areas such as Zouerate  where there are foreigners at work  to arouse the hypocritical bourgeois conscience of the capitalist world  which mindlessly organizes international genocide and remains indifferent to the atrocities daily visited on the Saharan people.66.	Trusting in Africa's wisdom  that wisdom rooted in the highest values of an ancestral humanism and a philosophy that has been forged in centuries of humiliation  the thirty-first session of the General Assembly left it to the Organization of African Unity to find a solution to the problem of Western Sahara—the just solution that the Saharan people and the international community rightfully expected. In so doing  it forgot that some of the so-called ""wise men of Africa"" had sold their conscience to the wealthy Powers.67.	Thus  like many others  the people of Western Sahara owe their Calvary to the fact that certain Powers  acting through their lackeys  wished to lay their hands on the mineral and other strategic natural resources of the area. Thus a vast plot  in which it became ever clearer that Morocco and Mauritania are the wretched and shabby instruments  has been hatched to subjugate the Saharan people  seize their wealth and establish a base for aggression against the independent African countries of the region. That vast and ignoble plot on the part of international imperialism was to succeed again in preventing the holding of a summit meeting of the heads of State of the OAU  who were to discuss the matter in Lusaka.68.	That is why it is reassuring that our Organization should have reserved the right to keep the item on its agenda. The item remains on its agenda because the case of Western Sahara is not only an African matter. It remains on the agenda because the principles that are flouted by Morocco and Mauritania are not those of the OAU alone but also of the United Nations Charter. It remains on our agenda because the situation in the region is sufficiently serious to continue claiming the attention of the international community.69.	In thus cynically trampling underfoot the fundamental principles of the Charters of the OAU and of the United Nations—principles to which they owe their own existence—those two States have lost the honour and respect which they won at the time of their struggle against French colonialism. But one of the accomplices in those misdeeds will have lost not only respect but no more nor less than its sovereignty as well. Indeed  the Mauritanian people are realizing today that  under the pretext of providing for its security  Morocco has seized upon this unexpected opportunity of realizing its ancient mad ambition simply to annex Mauritanian territory.70.	Mauritania  if not grateful  should at least recall the support given it at the time by the international community—an effective support that was not bought or sold—in the defence of its inalienable right to self- determination and the inviolability of the frontiers it inherited from the colonial era.71.	By adopting a firm and unequivocal position on this question  our Organization will vis-à-vis the Saharan people take the just and historic decision which is necessary and also permit the Mauritanian people to recover its sovereignty.72.	That is why  in our opinion  faithful to its noble ideals and the universal principles which constitute the cornerstone of its actions  our Organization must tirelessly pursue efforts with a view to finding an equitable and early solution to the Saharan problem. In this regard my delegation hopes very much that the Secretary-General  under the mandate entrusted to him at the thirtieth session  will submit a report on the situation prevailing in the Territory.73.	Many international economic conferences are held one after another  and each is more disappointing than the other  since none proves capable of finding just solutions to the problems that today confront our world. No effort has been made internationally to start building the new international economic order that would put an end to the shameful system of exploitation  economic oppression and inequitable relations which continue to be the foundation of international economic life.74.	Since the thirty-first session  the gulf between the wealthy countries and the poor countries of the third world has widened even further. The economic crisis which is now shaking the capitalist world with its inflationary effects has aggravated the balance-of-payments deficit of the poor countries.75.	It is impossible to exaggerate the selfishness of the capitalist Powers  which will stop at nothing in the pursuit of the sordid advantages that they have arrogated to themselves at the expense of the peoples of the third world. It is that selfishness which underlies the adjournment of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation. It is that selfishness which underlies the cynical attempts at economic strangulation directed against certain States whose policies of economic independence are inimical to the interests of neo-colonialist and imperialist circles. It is that selfishness which underlies the systematic sabotage of all international negotiations by the imperialist Powers  which are trying to sow dissension among the States of the third world and which oppose the establishment of a united front that might jeopardize their unjust advantages.76.	Thus  notwithstanding all the literature and all the declarations of good intentions concerning the establishment of a new international economic order  and despite the adoption in this very Assembly of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  our Organization still has very much to do in order to secure the triumph of its ideals of peace and social justice on a world scale.77.	Because it is confident that just causes always triumph in the end  my country  the People's Republic of Benin  would like to reiterate its appeal that all the countries of the third world join forces in the just struggle to preserve the fundamental interests of our States and peoples-for fierce and resolute struggle remains the only effective means to secure the triumph of our rights in this world which is threatened by the domination of imperialism and other forms of exploitation of man by man.78.	It is because of that fight that the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam have come to swell our ranks. My delegation welcomes their admission  not only because of the universality of our Organization  but also because we are sure that those two States will bring to our debates here the wisdom and experience that they have acquired in the course of their long liberation struggle. Indeed the Vietnamese people  through its historical victories over all the imperialist coalitions  have given the wretched of the earth not only new hope but also and above all an example to be followed.79.	I should now like to conclude where I should have begun  that is to say  by extending to you  Mr. President  the sincere and warm congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty- second session of the General Assembly. Your election unquestionably represents a stirring tribute to your own personal distinction  your diplomatic talent and personal virtues. But your election is also a deserved tribute to your country  the socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  which has always played and continues to play a role of great political importance within the non-aligned movement  I should like therefore to express the deep satisfaction of my delegation which remains convinced that  under your wise and far-sighted guidance  the work of the thirty-second session will achieve certain success.80.	You  Sir  have taken over the presidency from Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  another very talented diplomat  who directed the work of the thirty-first session with great skill and who continues to conduct the very difficult negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.81.	Neither would I wish to fail to seize this opportunity of expressing from this rostrum the sincere congratulations of my Government for the sustained and effective work of our Secretary-General. My delegation is fully aware of the difficulties that the highest officer of our Organization must overcome in order to secure the triumph of the noble and humanitarian ideals proclaimed in our Charter. I should like here to assure the Secretary-General of the complete confidence and co-operation of my country for the maintenance of world peace and security  for the self- determination of peoples against colonialism and neo-colonialism  against racism and apartheid.32. Ready for revolution  the struggle continues. "
"11",569,"BFA",32,1977,"﻿45.	 Mr. President  since I am speaking for the first time here in this Assembly  by your leave I should like to associate myself fully with the warm congratulations which have already been addressed to you on the occasion of your election. The unanimous decision of this Assembly to entrust to you the task of guiding our work is a stirring tribute to the policies of your country and to your personal qualities as a seasoned diplomat. The considerable experience you have had in the United Nations and your undisputed authority make you particularly qualified to preside over the important debates of this thirty-second session. Mr. President  I can assure you of the complete co-operation of the delegation of Upper Volta in the discharge of your duties.46.	It is also a pleasure to pay a well-deserved tribute to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe who  with his wisdom and talents as an enlightened diplomat  guided with exceptional success the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.47.	Finally  I ""should like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the devotion  perception and dedication with which he guides the destiny of the Organization. I should like to express to him our complete satisfaction and total support for his praiseworthy efforts in his lofty and exalted post.48.	I could not go into the substantive problems in my statement without first expressing my personal happiness at seeing seated among us the representatives of the brother people of Djibouti and the Vietnamese people. Those two States will  I am certain  make a dynamic contribution to the work of our Organization and to the attainment of the noble objectives of the Charter. Their admission represents also a further step towards the universality at which the United Nations aims.49.	I wish now to touch on some of the complex and disturbing questions that deserve the full attention of our Assembly. Despite exceptional efforts made by our Organization and the international community  the world is beset with grave problems that require urgent solutions first and foremost the problem of southern Africa.50.	Southern Africa remains a dangerous tinderbox which threatens peace in that region and in the world because apartheid is violence  both moral and physical  and because apartheid represents a total contempt for our Organization and its Charter. Upper Volta  whose philosophy is based on respect for man  whatever his civilization or culture  denounces and condemns once again the anachronistic and ignoble scourge of apartheid which stops at nothing to repress and massacre innumerable Africans  whose only crime is that they have a black skin. From this rostrum I wish to pay a tribute to the memory of Steven Biko and to all the martyrs of southern Africa who courageously fell before bullets or were crushed by torture  and to all those who  while we are meeting here  are paying dearly in the horrors of the gaols of Vorster and Ian Smith for their rejection of apartheid and for their ardent quest for dignity  justice and independence.51.	The situation in southern Africa is all the more disturbing since the racist regimes strive ferociously to increase and improve their means of repression and destruction  including nuclear weapons. From this rostrum we solemnly appeal to all the great Powers and their allies and to the entire international community to take appropriate measures so as to make Vorster incapable of threatening African States and world peace. The black community will no longer be content with beautiful words while Vorster  with the benefit of the lucrative economic relations which South Africa maintains with a good number of States  openly arms in defiance of innumerable resolutions of this Assembly.52.	The illegal occupation of the international Territory of Namibia by the racist regime of Pretoria and the introduction into that country of the policy of apartheid and bantustanization constitute a defiance of the United Nations and of the international community. It is necessary decisively to counter that action by South Africa so as to hasten Namibia's accession to independence by democratic means and under United Nations supervision. In this respect we reaffirm the need to give SWAPO all the political and material support it needs in the just struggle it wages for freedom.53.	The obduracy of the rebel racist minority in desperately holding on to its power and the resulting situation of conflict jeopardize the very existence of the white community of that country. We believe that it is more urgent than ever to find a final solution for the Rhodesian problem on the basis of majority rule.54.	The Anglo-American plan is the last chance for a peaceful settlement. If it fails Africa would have no choice other than to resort to the only solution capable of making Ian Smith give way—armed struggle to the end.55.	The situation in the Middle Hast continues to threaten the peace and development of the region. Upper Volta attentively follows the evolution of that disturbing question and hopes that in the Middle Hast a just and lasting peace will soon be established on the basis of the following elements: withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied by force since 1967; the right of every State in the region to live within secure and recognized borders: and the recognition and implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.56.	All that leads us to deplore the recent measures taken by Israel to establish new settlements on the West Bank. It is  nevertheless  our hope that the negotiations under way for a resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East will be positive. However  it would be an illusion to imagine that that Conference will arrive at lasting results without the effective  full and complete participation of the Palestinian people represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization.57.	The separation of the island of Mayotte from the rest of the Comoros is still a situation that worries all African States. We trust that the lofty mission entrusted to the current President of the OAU with respect to the President of France will rapidly produce a satisfactory solution to this question.58.	We welcome the efforts made by the Secretary- General to find a lasting solution to the painful problem of Cyprus. Upper Volta deplores the interference of otherStates in the internal affairs of Cyprus and sincerely hopes that the two communities  Greek and Turkish alike  will arrive at an understanding and agreement with independence and in non-alignment.59.	In 1976 military expenditure reached the fabulous sum of S350 billion; that is the equivalent of the combined gross national product of all the nations of Latin America  Africa and the Middle East; it is the equivalent of national expenditure for education throughout the world  double the expenditure for health  and 15 times higher than foreign aid to developing countries.60.	Given such waste and the destructive potential it entails  the disarmament problem becomes acute. We are pleased  therefore  with the many attempts at  and laborious discussions on  disarmament. The initiative of the non-aligned countries to convene in 1978 a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will perhaps allow us to Jay the groundwork for effective disarmament.61.	These developments warrant the hope that mode rating influences will carry more weight on behalf of the cause in which man  by his inalienable right to existence  happiness and to a future  must always have the final word.62.	Among the matters involving our Organization  I wish to highlight the consensus agreements reached here and State sovereignty  a sacrosanct principle of international law  which  in current circumstances  no one could think of renouncing.63.	Yet  here perhaps more than in ideological confrontations and conflicts of interest lies the bone of contention  since it is obviously inconceivable that United Nations resolutions should be perceived or received with indifference by the countries concerned without serious damage to international order itself. The pressure tactics or retaliatory' measures which have sometimes been resorted to  and their generally unfruitful results  are certainly among the most basic causes of the feeling of dissatisfaction with the international political order in our times.64.	The bitter fruits of this state of affairs are: violence in all its forms  the crystallization of selfish interests  intolerance  the balancing act between the great Powers now elevated to a new diplomatic art  and the feeling of helplessness experienced by the weakest.65.	Now  let us not be misled: never has our world been in greater need of an. international morality endowed with the essential legitimacy which would derive from its unreserved acceptance  without ulterior motives  by the whole international community.66.	Indeed  what led to the creation of the United Nations on the morrow of an atrocious war was mankind's need for new foundations for his future and for his survival  for a new approach to the world's problems  for a new philosophy of international relations-in short  for a new international morality.67.	But  as you will agree  that new ethic has not  unfortunately  gained ground as it should have because of the narrow interests of States.68.	Yet  the situation we find ourselves in  overshadowed by economic crisis and monetary disarray  coupled with a fresh outburst of foreign competition on the African continent  may aggravate the all-too-well-known symptoms.69.	Hence it is with particular seriousness that I appeal for an attempt to define this new international morality so urgently needed by our world. Otherwise there may be a dangerous escalation of unbridled competition  violence  and perhaps  alas  the ultimate apocalypse. What our world needs  individually as well as collectively  is a reason to believe-a reason that is sufficiently imperative to justify forgetting circumstantial interests  so as to rise above selfish interests. In a word  what our world needs is a new brotherhood of man  a new practice in international relations based on the innate feeling of justice common to every man. Only such a practice will be able to create a feeling of real and binding obligation before which even the principle of State sovereignty itself will be bound to yield.70.	True  centuries of traditions  ways of life and thinking will not easily be altered. Nobody wants to give away his trump cards  his ability to respond to events  that enable him to perpetuate his dominant position or his material interests. Yet  some doctrines would lose much of their attractiveness and would more clearly reveal the price to be paid it this new international morality  the requirements and implications of which are certainly not difficult to define  could find its proper course in the light of the profound crisis which our world is undergoing  and could in the immediate future be established boldly where confrontations are becoming manifest  namely in Africa71.	I have deliberately dwelt on the political factors and prospects which form the background of international relations  but I would be remiss were I to overlook economic problems  because the survival of our civilization is threatened not only by conflicts and the arms race  but also  if not more so  by disparities in economic development. In this field  the countries concerned must  of course  make the major effort; but  regrettably  such efforts have often failed because of external forces entirely beyond their control. That is what is happening  for example  in the Sahelian countries  where droughts and floods alternate  leaving in their wake death  devastation and poverty. Who can affirm in all conscience that this seasonal disruption is in no way related to all the atmospheric and stratospheric experiments that have been carried out? Meanwhile  the submission to States  for their consideration  of an international Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques proves  if that were necessary  that man can now deliberately manipulate the natural elements.72.	Upper Volta  despite these difficulties  is tirelessly pursuing a policy which combines a desire for rapid economic growth and a concern for integrated development. After the five-year plan which has just been completed with specific achievements  a new plan is under way which will place greater emphasis on agricultural production  the essential basis and principal vehicle of our economic development.73.	If  in spite of everything  our situation still encounters obstacles to be overcome  it is not so much because of our unfavourable geographical position as because of the erratic climate which makes Upper Volta a Sahelian country. The tragedies suffered by the Sahelian countries from 1968 to 1973 endangered the already difficult lives of 20 million human beings. But again this year  drought has clearly reminded us that  in order to deal with the over-all damage to our lands and environment  the solution must not be found in any effort to change the climate because this is a recurrent and inevitable climatic condition of arid  semi- arid and subhumid regions.74.	We must perforce learn to control water by a sound and rational policy with regard to water resources. In this respect  two world conferences have indicated their vital importance this year. One was the United Nations Water Conference  held in Mar del Plata some months ago  which reached positive conclusions on the most rational method of managing water resources throughout the world in order to meet the growing requirements  particularly in the arid-zone countries. The other was the United Nations Conference on Desertification  held in September last in Nairobi This important Conference  at which more than 100 States of our Organization met  including the Scandinavian countries  bears witness to the interest that mankind attaches to this problem.75.	However  my country  Upper Volta  did not wait for the Conference on Desertification to attack the evil at its roots. In fact since 1963 our public authorities have undertaken a vast anti-erosion campaign in the north of our country. Thus we reclaimed more than 300 000 hectares. Since then  action by the Government has also been carried out on a certain number of strategic projects intended in particular to remedy ecological imbalances. Among these measures  Upper Volta gives a high priority to reforestation  and that is why  within the framework of the regional development organizations  we are experimenting with reforestation in villages. !t is true that in our Sudan-Sahelian zone deforestation is at present the most serious form of ecological deterioration. Therefore a bold policy must be undertaken by an extensive and intensive programme of reforestation. For such a programme to be effective it must be included in a subregional or regional context and have the support of the popular masses through their being made aware of the problems and being mobilized to deal with them  because it is the attitude of men and their ability to assimilate new factors which will largely determine productivity.76.	The United Nations has an eminent role to play in the success of this vast and sound undertaking. It is from this standpoint that the Government of Upper Volta would like to propose to this Assembly that the tree should constitute the theme for our thinking when it comes to fighting desertification. We are prepared to seek with all States concerned the appropriate context for action along these lines.77.	The hopes of half a billion human beings are at present based on the plan of action which marked the end of the work of the Conference. Even though we did not attain unanimity  because of differences among industrialized and developing countries regarding the establishment of a special fund for desertification  and even though the effective implementation of the plan of action would require the solution of a certain number of prior questions  it remains no less true that the Nairobi Conference has paved the way to genuine international solidarity in regard to that new international economic order to which we all aspire.78.	This new economic order  as we have all recognized  assumes a redefinition  or rather a readjustment  of North- South relations  with a systematic search for justice and equity. We are bound to recognize that in this matter the rich and the poor do not speak the same language. The fourth session of UNCTAD  the results of which did not fulfil our hopes  and the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  or North-South dialogue  which did not succeed in making positions more flexible  both bear eloquent testimony to the differences in assessment and equally in the approach to relationships based on interests. The situation we are witnessing at the end of this century is not only a worsening of the terms of trade but also a deterioration in the terms of negotiation.79.	Yet a little attention to the actual facts is all that is needed to be convinced of the need for international action for the benefit of the poor countries  in which the tragedy of man daily becomes more distressing.80.	In most of these countries the per capita annual growth does not exceed 0.3 per cent  whereas the rate scheduled for the Second United Nations Development Decade is 3.5 per cent. This rate appears to be even lower in the Sahelian countries  where most of the least advanced poor countries are located. When one notes that in the region nature is inclement and that the shortage of rainfall so far this year threatens to aggravate the grain crisis at a time when it is at a critical threshold  one immediately realizes how necessary and urgent a solution is.81.	As far as trade is concerned  the balance of world trade has deteriorated at the expense of the developing countries  whose exports have risen by a little less than 4 per cent since 1975  that is  far below the 7 per cent target set for the Second Development Decade. Conversely  their imports have risen in the proportions imposed by the persistent inflation  the rising prices and the economic recession in the developed countries. Hence they have experienced a trade deficit of approximately S35 billion.82.	The same tendency is apparent in their external indebtedness  which remains disturbing  particularly because of the high rate and unequal distribution of the indebtedness of the developing countries to their creditors. This indebtedness has doubled in three years and it has now risen to SI30 billion. For this year alone statistics foresee an increase of the order of S30 billion.83.	In these circumstances aid for development becomes marginal  particularly if one takes into account the financing needs of the poor countries  which will rise to approximately S60 billion at the end of the present decade.84.	It is evident that one can no longer expect these countries to finance  by borrowing  a deficit imposed on them by the international crisis and by the selfishness of the market-economy countries.85.	This rather sombre picture reveals the alarming situation of the developing countries  which urgently need measures of assistance if chaos is to be avoided In this respect we must warmly thank the friendly countries which  through bilateral and multilateral assistance  have given valuable aid to our development effort.86.	Those among them which have not hesitated to devote 1 per cent of their gross national product to development aid above all deserve our profound gratitude. We appeal to them to intensify this effort and to make it more dynamic by increasing assistance for our development. In particular we appreciate the decision taken by States which  like Canada  have decided to convert debts into selfless aid. Upper Volta firmly believes that the future of the world depends on co-operation among men if we wish to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  as was proclaimed as long ago as 1945 by the nations among us which had the historic mission of laying the foundations of our Organization. An international conference  the Afro- Arab summit  paved the way for this form of multilateral co-operation. May it lead to other similar initiatives so that our world may advance in peace and prosperity.87.	For our part we wish to reiterate our commitment to discharge our common responsibilities unflaggingly alongside the other nations represented here  not only to liberate mankind from the spectre of war but also to ensure for coming generations a universe of justice  progress and prosperity.

"12",612,"BGD",32,1977,"﻿232.	Sir  on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh and my delegation  it is both a pleasure and privilege for me to congratulate you most warmly on your election as President of this thirty-second General Assembly session. We can say with the utmost confidence that your eminent qualifications  your intimate knowledge of the work of this Organization and the many important services you have rendered on behalf of your country will contribute greatly to the success of our work. It gives us added pleasure that for the second year in succession a Member State of the non-aligned movement is at the helm of our affairs.233.	I should also like to express our deep appreciation to the President of the last session  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  whose determined and energetic leadership was a major contribution to the successful conclusion of the thirty-first session.234.	I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  who in his second term continues his tireless efforts on behalf of the world community with vision  courage and infinite patience. He has successfully upheld the Charter principles of fairness  impartiality and dedication to the cause of peace and human dignity in the world. Bangladesh owes a particular debt of gratitude to him for his continuing sympathy  concern and positive interest in our affairs.235.	Bangladesh hails the admission of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations as sovereign equals. We extend our fullest co-operation to the delegations of these friendly countries. We expect to work with them in the closest harmony.236.	With the accession of its one hundred forty-eighth and one hundred forty-ninth Members the United Nations has taken another vital step towards the fulfilment of its goal to embrace all the nations of the world. The approach to universality underscores the dramatic changes that have taken place in the last 30 years since the inception of this Organization. The most striking aspect of change is reflected in the composition and character of contemporary international society: the number of sovereign States in the world has multiplied threefold. However  a vast segment of the world population still remains shackled by the bonds of colonial rule or suffers as victims of political repression.237.	The thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly is meeting under the shadow of a deepening political and economic crisis. The Middle East continues to remain an explosive area of tension. Unless the initiatives now under way to bring about a peaceful settlement are brought to an immediate and successful conclusion  that region may very well become the theatre of another all-consuming holocaust.238.	Bangladesh firmly believes that a just and durable peace can only be ensured by the withdrawal of all Israel's forces from the Arab territories it has occupied since June 1967  including the holy city of Jerusalem  and the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including an independent State in Palestine. : Towards this end Bangladesh urges all parties concerned vigorously to renew efforts for the early convening of the Geneva Conference with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.239.	Bangladesh strongly condemns the continued attempts of Israel to entrench its occupation by colonizing that region to rough a chain of illegal settlements designed to changed the geographical and demographic composition of the occupied territories. Bangladesh reiterates its total support for the measures recommended by the recent extraordinary meetings held in New York of the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries and of the Foreign Ministers of the States members of the Islamic Conference towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.240.	The great continent of Africa is a stir with the promise of total emancipation  but the southern part of it still continues to bleed under the repressive rule of racist minority regimes. Bangladesh fully supports the legitimate struggle of the African people in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa for freedom  liberty and human dignity and is convinced that their efforts are bound ultimately to triumph.241.	While we note the initiatives being taken on the one hand by the United Kingdom and the United States in Zimbabwe  and on the other hand by five members of the Security Council-the United Kingdom  Canada  France  the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States-in Namibia  Bangladesh believes that independence in these last remaining bastions of colonialism can and must be achieved without concessions to the principles already embodied in the resolutions of the United Nations.242.	Bangladesh welcomes the success of the two important world conferences in Africa this year: the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe andNamibia  held in Maputo  and the Lagos World Conference for Action Against Apartheid We firmly believe that the declarations and programmes of action adopted in these forums provide the international community with a concrete framework of action that must be vigorously pursued.243.	Annually the international community records for posterity the dangers inherent in the failure to disarm. Yearly the disarmament debate echoes the refrain that failure to act is a hazardous folly-a madness. And yet  ironically enough  the only palliative is the recognition of the peril and the record of its danger and cost to mankind  with no significant advance being made to halt  control or reverse this process.244.	The record of progress in the disarmament negotiations is indeed pitiful in its content. Only seven treaties adopted by the United Nations General Assembly are in force. Regional and bilateral efforts  particularly by the super-Powers  have failed dismally to live up to even the minimum expectations. What is worse is that moves towards the limitation and reduction of conventional weapons have also been completely ignored  notwithstanding the fact that all armed conflicts since 1945 have been fought with conventional weapons.245.	As we have stated  the dimensions of the problem are well known  in all their staggering impact. What is needed is the will and determination for action to halt and reverse this inexorable drive to destruction and to enable a new international security system to achieve a world free from war. Bangladesh  therefore  attaches great importance to the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament and the formulation of a declaration and programme of action.246.	While the problems of nuclear disarmament and of the proliferation of nuclear weapons continue to be the predominant concerns  Bangladesh's particular interest will lie in the measures directed towards the protection of the interests of the non-nuclear countries  including security guarantees and measures towards the creation of nuclear- weapon-free zones and zones of peace  freedom and neutrality in South' and South-East Asia and elsewhere. Of overriding priority is the relation between disarmament and development and the widespread concern to find practical and concrete ways to reduce military budgets and to transfer human and material resources to more productive ends  particularly in the cause of economic and social development.247.	Bangladesh has been making every possible effort for peace and stability in the subcontinent on the basis of mutual respect for sovereign equality  independence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We have striven to promote the process of accommodation along all avenues open to us. It is our firm belief that Bangladesh would be able materially to contribute towards building astructure of enduring and durable peace in South and South-East Asia.248.	Events in the subcontinent over the past year have once more focused international attention on our part of the world. A spirit of greater understanding and cooperation appears to be emerging throughout the region. We believe that this spirit must be fostered.249.	A series of bilateral meetings between Bangladesh and India on the sharing of the Ganges waters were held in pursuance of the consensus statement adopted on 26 November 1976 at the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am indeed happy to report that the last meeting held at the official level in New Delhi was concluded on 30 September 1977 with the initialling of an agreement. That successful outcome of highly complicated and protracted negotiations is pre-eminently due to the statesmanship shown by the leaders of the two countries. This agreement covers the sharing of the Ganges waters at Farakka between Bangladesh and India for the period from 1 January to 31 May every year. The agreement also provides for study of long-term measures to augment the dry-season flow of the Ganges. It also includes provisions for machinery of implementation by a joint committee to be constituted by the representatives of the two countries. The agreement is for an initial period of five years. It may be extended by mutual agreement at the appropriate time. The agreement will be formally signed at a level and date to be mutually determined by the two Governments. With the initialling of the agreement  the first part of the task was accomplished and it is hoped that a permanent solution may be found through the optimum development of water resources of international rivers flowing through the territories of these countries for the welfare of the millions of people of the two nations. We believe that this agreement will serve as an important milestone in the efforts of the two countries to improve all their relations and to maintain peace and stability in the region. I should like to take this opportunity  on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh  to convey our most sincere thanks to all of our friends who have contributed towards reaching this agreement.250.	Fruitful steps were recently taken by Bangladesh further to strengthen its relations with Pakistan. We look forward to increasing co-operation with Pakistan in all fields.251.	Bangladesh continues to strive to consolidate its ties with its neighbours and near neighbours  including Afghanistan  Bhutan  Burma  Nepal and Sri Lanka.252.	We believe that Bangladesh  by virtue of its geographical location as well as its historical and cultural affinities with the people of South-East Asia  stands as a bridge between this region and the subcontinent. It is our intention to pursue every effort to strengthen our relations with our South-East Asian neighbours.253.	Bangladesh has consistently adhered to the principles of non-alignment as the corner-stone of its foreign policy. Bound by deeply rooted historical and cultural ties - Bangladesh has always expressed its sense of solidarity with the Islamic countries and has been persistent in its effortsto strengthen the fraternal relations existing between Bangladesh and those countries.254.	No review of the Asian region in international relations can be complete without reference to the Indian Ocean. Bangladesh strongly supports the initiative regarding the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  the major objective being to safeguard the peace and security of the countries of the region. We believe that  for the Declaration to be effective and meaningful  it must be complemented by a commitment on the part of the regional States to the principles of universal collective security  without military alliances  under the umbrella of the United Nations Charter  including their renunciation of the threat or use of force  whether nuclear or conventional  against one another.255.	The international community has in recent years been grappling with two vital initiatives with regard to the progressive development and codification of international law. The deliberations in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have now reached a crucial decision-making stage. As a coastal developing countries  Bangladesh has a large stake in the successful outcome of the Conference. Of particular importance to Bangladesh is its case pertaining to baselines and the delineation of maritime boundaries. The unique geographical and geomorphological circumstances that govern our coastline led us to submit a formulation covering what we believe constituted a legitimate exception within the universally acceptable norms. At the last session  in spite of overwhelming overt support and no opposition from any State to the inclusion of our proposal in the basic negotiating text before the Conference  our proposal was excluded. We continue to believe that the exclusion of our text  given the nature of the document-that of a negotiating instrument rather than one that had been negotiated-would be tantamount to leaving us isolated. The merit of our case lay in seeking the objective sanction of the Conference as a whole. We are firmly of the view that  for an adequate and proper consideration of the composite informal negotiating text  our formulation should also be taken into consideration at the forthcoming session of the Conference. We believe that a crucial motivation of the Conference must be to accord preferential treatment to the poorer and geographically disadvantaged nations as the logical consequence of the concept of the common heritage of mankind.256.	The United Nations Water Conference was to highlight the need for another major initiative in the sphere of international legal order for the progressive development and codification of the rules of international law regulating non-navigational uses of international watercourses  and particularly the development and use of shared water resources. Given the finite nature of water resources and the ever rising pressures on those resources  Bangladesh believes that the matter is one of paramount importance and urgency  for it raises questions that have an immense bearing on the economic well-being of vast numbers of people on this globe. We would urge the International Law Commission  already charged with the responsibility of pursuing the matter  to expedite the submission of an international convention.257.	As we review these crucial global developments  the position of Bangladesh and its contribution to the development process is a matter of intense introspection for us and one that would be of some interest in the international community. Despite the difficulties inherent in the circumstances of its traumatic birth  Bangladesh continues not only to survive but also to grow in stability and strength  thus manifesting the political will of its people and the inner vitality of its society. It has succeeded in overcoming formidable problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction. Following a political and economic programme endorsed by the people through a nation-wide referendum  Bangladesh has launched far-reaching political  administrative and economic reforms. As a step towards the establishment of democratic institutions on the basis of universal adult suffrage at local and national levels  elections to 4 352 village union councils and 79 municipal councils have already been held  and elections to district councils and to the national parliament are scheduled to be held in December 1977 and 1978 respectively. The administrative and services structures have been reorganized with a view to making those services more efficient and more attuned to the national objectives of economic and social development. A three-year hard-core programme of development  to be completed by the end of the current year  is now being implemented; and a five-year plan  to be preceded by a two-year approach plan within the framework of a 20-year perspective plan  is being prepared.258.	The main thrust of our planned efforts in the economic sector is towards rural development around co-operatives  a rapid increase in food production  the stabilization of prices  population control and population development. About half the country has already been covered under the integrated rural development programme. As a result of increased agricultural production  the importation of food grains was reduced from 2.2 million tons in 1974/1975 to 800 000 tons in 1976/1977. Given favourable weather conditions and an adequate supply of inputs  Bangladesh  will  it is hoped  be able to raise its food production within the next few years to the point where it can become fully self-sufficient in food. The prices of essential commodities have also been lowered and the cost-of-living index  which had risen to 500 per cent in 1974  is currently down to 300 per cent  in 1969/1970 prices. A key development strategy is the decentralization of the planning machinery and the generation of self-reliant efforts on the part of the people through their direct participation in the formulation and implementation of the development plans at the local levels. Along with a vigorous family-planning programme  a nation-wide campaign has been mounted for the mobilization and harnessing of the country's vast human resources for productive efforts. The National Foundation for Research on Human Resources Development  headed by the President of Bangladesh  has been set up in the light of the decision of the Co-ordinating Bureau of non-Aligned Countries. We shall be happy to share our experience in this regard with countries of the third world.259.	The experience of Bangladesh in the field of development indicates however  certain constraints inherent in global factors which call for closer co-operation among the nations of the world.260.	The international community is largely composed of States in a similar position to that of Bangladesh. The hopes and aspirations of those States represent the wishes of the great majority of the world's peoples. It is in those countries that the largest mass of humanity is concentrated and is confronted with the entire range of social and economic ills that characterize under-development.261.	It is here that the world's major political crises rage. Notwithstanding their combined weight  which has transformed the structure and voting"" pattern of the United Nations  those countries yet remain outside the plane of true decision-making. Their role and integration in this process constitute the most important potential for peace and prosperity in the world.262.	Faced with the series of global problems that now confront the international community  no nation  however rich or powerful  can remain immune  nor can any nation hope to resolve them without the co-operation of all. While modern communications and the advances of science and technology have led us to a common perception of our unity and shared dependence  they have also highlighted the dangers of divisiveness. Differences in military and economic strength are hard realities. While the classic relationship of domination of the many by the few—the so-called vertical polarization—has been somewhat eroded  in its place has emerged the equally disturbing phenomenon of unequal relations among States and the threat to their economic and political sovereignty emanating not only from the big Powers but also from medium-sized and small Powers.263.	If there is any theme that emerges from the foregoing brief analysis  it is the recognition of the basic amalgam between national and international interests  sometimes conflicting  but essentially coinciding. Bangladesh firmly believes that the cardinal function and indeed justification of the United Nations lies in its search for the preservation of the delicate balance between nationalism and international responsibility. The motive force of the Organization—the very essence of its community—lies in the need to protect the weak from the strong through the manifestation of collective responsibility and the strengthening of collective capacity to deal with the problems that face all of our nations. It is towards this end that we must strive.264.	In assessing the work of this Organization we are conscious of its limitations. The Secretary-General himself acknowledged in his report on the work of the Organization that ""a miraculous and sudden transformation to a new and better world order is inconceivable"". But it is our task to seize the initiatives taken and to build  brick by brick  an edifice that will substantially contribute to the long-term interests of all States.265.	We believe that the foundation already exists; that Governments  including the major Powers  do consciously recognize the value of the United Nations as a vital mechanism for strengthening their relationships and fostering their short-term goals. For countries such as ours  powerless in isolation  the United Nations certainly provides  through cohesion and a shared awareness of problems; a greater strength. It does provide a safety-valve to release gathering tensions when bilateral efforts fail to achieve their objectives.267- What  then  are the priorities for the future? First  Bangladesh believes that a cardinal imperative is to ensure that sovereignty and genuine freedom of action are not compromised by external interference from any source whatsoever. Secondly  it is our combined task to pursue the unfinished revolution facing the great majority of people  so that the peoples of the developing countries may emerge from bondage into freedom  from exploitation into economic emancipation  and from dependence into self- reliance. Thirdly  it is a vital task to seek the integration of all nations into the decision-making process. No society whether national or international  can fail to ignore even its weakest link without affecting its cohesion. Fourthly  it is our task to seek consolidation of our unity and mutual co-operation  not by a mere affirmation of principles alone  by meaningful and practical programmes of action and the will to translate them into reality. Finally  it is our task so to use our combined national power as to create and not to destroy  to enter into dialogue rather than confrontation  to build peace and abjure war  to advance human welfare instead of aggravating human suffering.268.	These are the basic elements that  in our opinion  constitute the keystone of the new international political and economic order.269.	As we stand today poised on the threshold of a new decade  we are conscious of the crucial economic stake in the quest for political stability and ordered prosperity in our world. This has placed before us the choice of achieving either unified and balanced progress of all mankind with human dignity  or a world torn by ever-widening social and economic inequalities.270.	The experience of the International Development Strategy of each of the last two decades  while strengthening the ability of the world to identify and recognize problems  also revealed that those Strategies had no real answers to the problems of mass poverty and mass unemployment which face most of our countries in the third world. Ad hoc solutions and basically short-term and patch-work remedies were essentially directed to preserve a system which itself was at fault r  d which tended to perpetuate the inequities of the existing order. The call  therefore  was made for a total restructuring of world economic relationships through a new and just international economic order.271.	Thus  in the last few years  through successive sessions of the General Assembly  through the fourth session of UNCTAD  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris and other forums  the international community has sought to spell out the pattern of this vital new design. An approach to a global perspective plan should provide greater equity through improved terms of trade  a better quality and greater flow of aid on softer terms  easier access to markets  the sharing of technological know-how and benefits  improved monetary facilities  the easing of indebtedness and a whole range of related issues. Despite the efforts at the various forums and the vital stakes involved  progress towards these ends been extremely disappointing.272.	One of the chief causes of the resistance to these efforts appears to be the unexpressed fear lurking in the minds of the industrially developed nations that any change in the existing world economy structure  however equitable and rational it may appear to be  would hurt their life-style. The fact  however  remains that if the vast human and other resources of the developing countries can be harnessed into productive use  with a resulting increase in the production of goods and services at a lower cost  that would be to the benefit of the entire world community  and that is the only way to stem the rising tide of inflation  which continues to plague their economies.273.	Some of the glaring absurdities inherent in the existing economic system are underscored by the following facts.274.	First  the developing world  representing 70 per cent of the world's population  commands only 30 per cent of total world resources.275.	Secondly  the share of the third world  with a population of more than 2 billion  in the production of manufactured goods is only 7 per cent.276.	Thirdly  the combined share of all the countries of the third world in total international trade is under 18 per cent.277.	Fourthly  while final consumers in the industrial countries pay over S200 billion for the major primary products of the developing countries  excluding oil. The developing countries receive back only S30 billion of that S200 billion.278.	Fifthly  the total external indebtedness of the developing countries has already exceeded S250 billion and their balance-of-payments deficit is about S30 billion.279.	As a result  the developing countries have been inexorably led to export more  and this has had a deleterious effect on the quality of life of the people of these countries. Such a position is totally untenable when the annual expenditure on armaments has already exceeded S300 billion.280.	In renewing our commitment to pursue the establishment of the new international economic order  Bangladesh believes that there is also a need for continuing introspection and an in-depth evaluation of past performance and a better perception of the conceptual framework in which the new order would evolve.281.	What was essentially lacking was specific action concerning the attack on poverty  the system of production  the distribution of income and wealth  and the socio-economic structures. Among the more significant lessons learned from experience  to which virtually no attention had been paid in the past  was the demonstrated futility of plan models in which the crucial role of a motivated  creative and innovative people as the main driving force in development was completely overlooked. The conversion of these human resources into viable human capital for national development has assumed such urgency that it requires priority attention.282.	Bangladesh believes that  among the essential elements that need to be mapped out in any future perspective plan for the evolution of the new international order  specific attention must be devoted to the following: first  eradicating poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy and assigning the highest priority to this task for concerted action by the international community; secondly  harnessing the vast human resources for productive use  thus generating more employment and more production of  food and services to be shared by the world community and therefore enriching the quality of life of the people globally; thirdly  strengthening the capacity of developing countries for individual and collective self-reliance through increased co-operation in economic and other fields  the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  to be held in Buenos Aires next August  being of special relevance to this objective; fourthly  radically transforming socio-economic structures  with particular stress on agrarian and rural development  the distribution of wealth and the means of production  greater decentralization at the grass-roots level to ensure the democratization of the political and economic decision-making process  and the promotion of self- management and local leadership; fifthly  focusing on the role and status of women and ensuring their full participation in national development and the. decision-making process; sixthly  redefining international policy governing the transfer of financial resources  with particular attention to the needs of the least developed and most seriously affected developing countries and  in this regard  matters that require an exploration of the flow of the resources to be generated are the exploitation of the resources of the sea bed and those to be released through possible disarmament and the lung-standing demand of the developing countries for an organic link between special drawing rights and development finance; seventhly  liberalizing trade by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers and meeting the mounting problem of the third world's accumulated debt  including rescheduling of existing debt liabilities and tying debt repayment to real resource transfers  and the conversion of the outstanding debts of the least developed countries into outright grants; eighthly  increasing the availability of and access to food-stuffs through appropriate structural transformation and technological innovation  with the realization that  while the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development has been a remarkable achievement  other mechanisms  particularly the early establishment of a decentralized system of essential food reserves  should be expeditiously fostered; ninthly  ensuring that people affected by natural disasters are always afforded adequate supplies to meet their basic needs  and in this regard  the institutional strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator and the possibility of an international disaster relief agency should be seriously explored; tenthly  adapting science and technology in order to promote the cause of development in the third world according to the indigenous requirements of the developing countries and; in this regard  the preparations for and the. results of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development will have particular relevance in mapping out a future strategy in this regard; eleventh  enhancing international co-operation in the field of energy resources and here Bangladesh strongly supports the idea mooted by the Secretary-General regarding the establishment of an energy institute and believes that this should be pursued urgently; finally  paying adequate attention to the economic content of human rights  which has not received equal treatment with the political content  because for the vast majority of people living below the poverty line human rights can be meaningful only when they are assured of their basic economic rights  namely  the right to food  shelter  clothing and education.283.	These are the 12 elements which we believe constitute an essential foundation for the planning of the next development strategy in what we believe must be the decade of equity. "
"13",658,"BGR",32,1977,"﻿158.	 Mr. President  I should first like to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the high post of President of the General Assembly  and also to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  for his very fruitful activities.159.	I am particularly pleased to welcome the newly admitted Members of the United Nations  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. We are convinced that heroic Viet Nam  which has now taken its rightful place in our Organization  will make a valuable contribution to the work of the United Nations through its active and peaceful policies.160.	The thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly has convened on the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution  which is correctly described as the main event of the twentieth century.161.	And  true enough  the October Revolution not only became the turning-point in the history of Russia  but also marked the beginning of a new stage in the history of the world  a stage distinguished by a profound reconstruction of the old system of international relations. That Revolution created conditions for the promotion of a new type of international relations between truly free and equal States  on the basis of the principles of socialist internationalism  fraternal friendship and all-round co-operation and mutual assistance. It gave a powerful impetus to the process of self-awareness and the self-determination of colonial and dependent peoples  a process which  after the Second World War  and with the active support of the socialist countries  developed into an accelerated decolonization and radically changed the political geography of the world. The road travelled by the Soviet Union from the Decree of Peace in 1917 to the Programme for Peace in 1971 and 1976 is marked by one and the same consistent and fundamental policy aimed at strengthening world peace and security  putting an end to the arms race and achieving disarmament  respecting the sovereign rights of all States  not interfering in their internal affairs  extinguishing the hotbeds of colonialism and racism and bringing about the broad development of international co-operation. The basic principles of this policy find their full expression in the draft of the new Constitution of the USSR and will thus be embodied in the supreme law of the Soviet State.162.	It is because of this policy which has been pursued unswervingly and supported by all peace-loving forces in the world  that mankind has not experienced the horrors of a world war for more than 30 years and that international relations have gradually become free from anachronisms and recurrences of the cold war.163.	If we had to describe in general terms the period which has elapsed since last year's session of the General Assembly  we could say that the prevailing trend in the development of the international situation continues to be the relaxation of international tensions. The tangible impetus given to detente in Helsinki two years ago made it possible to promote further the cause of peace  not only in Europe  but in the whole world as well. The successes which have been achieved are considerable: political ties and confidence among States have been strengthened  ever more strength has been imparted to the material fabric of co-operation in the fields of the economy  science and technology and culture. Of course  the most important achievement remains that of having made the nightmare of a new world war more remote. At the same time  however  it should also be emphasized that certain influential reactionary forces have stepped up their efforts to slow down  to check and  in the final analysis  to torpedo the very process of detente. What is more  there have been some actions which have created the danger of returning the world to the days of the cold war.164.	One of the manifestations of these efforts is the launching of hostile and slanderous campaigns against the socialist countries. It is not difficult to understand that these campaigns are undertaken as a smoke-screen in order to conceal interference in internal affairs  in order to increase military budgets and to stockpile new armaments. The main obstacle which is now blocking the road to detente and threatening to impair its achievements is the continuing arms race. World peace cannot be achieved as long as the danger of a thermo-nuclear holocaust is not removed and as long as real measures are not taken in the field of disarmament. As Todor Zhivkov  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria said recently:""The main objective now is to make detente an irreversible process. This has not yet been done. Furthermore  the arms race  side by side with detente  is being whipped up  and I would say even more intensely. That is what is most dangerous for the world now. That is the main threat to world peace. Therefore the halting of the arms race is the immediate  fundamental and most urgent task.""165.	As is well known  the countries of the socialist community have put forward a constructive programme with new dimensions for co-operation among States  a programme which is aimed at broadening the scope of detente and supplementing it with measures in the military field.166.	The proposal addressed to the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for the conclusion of a treaty whereby each would engage not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against the others is also in this spirit. Reaching an agreement on this question  as Leonid Ilich Brezhnev has pointed out  would provide new opportunities for curtailing conventional armaments in Europe  especially where their concentration is great.167.	Unfortunately  once again certain influential circles are still captives of the one-sided approach towards the initiatives of the socialist countries and have not reacted to them positively.168.	The countries of the socialist community have repeatedly stated that they do not lay claim to the monopoly as far as initiatives are concerned; they are prepared to consider any idea as long as it is genuinely aimed at stopping the arms race. Yet  instead of such ideas  we often hear general declarations which are at variance with and even sometimes completely contradict the actions taken by the respective Governments. It is impossible to fan hostility for other countries while at the same time talking about allegiance to detente  just as it is impossible to speed up the arms race and simultaneously to conduct successful negotiations on disarmament.169.	This peculiar dualism in the policies of certain States is fraught with great danger for peace. All those who bear responsibility for the policies of their countries and for the fate of world peace must become aware of this danger. Mankind  which is anxious to rid itself of the burden of armaments  needs no declarations of good intentions  but rather the pragmatic consideration of specific proposals for disarmament and the adoption of effective measures to this end  without any attempt to obtain unilateral military- strategic advantages.170.	The intention of beginning the production of the so-called neutron bomb and its inclusion in armaments has caused serious concern which has taken the form of a storm of indignation and forthright protest on the part of world public opinion. That intention can only be regarded as an attempt to impose a new round of the arms race upon nations  as a challenge to the climate of detente created with so much effort. It is not without point to recall  however  that the arms race will bring no lasting advantages to those who initiate it. It will only place a further heavy burden upon the shoulders of the peoples and may in fact bring them yet another step closer to the danger which is the peril of human civilization.171.	We do believe that the voice of reason will prevail  so that the way may be paved towards sincere co-operation in order to put an end to the arms race and to move forward towards real disarmament. We are convinced that the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly will provide  an opportunity for agreement on a common  principled approach to disarmament  and will create favourable conditions for convening a world disarmament conference in the near future.172.	The most complex and the most important task continues to be that of putting an end to the arms race and curbing nuclear weapons both qualitatively and quantitatively.173.	An important step in this direction would be the total prohibition of nuclear-weapons tests. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always held the view that this problem needs to be resolved as soon as possible. We attach great importance to the tripartite negotiations in Geneva. We support the constructive position taken by the Soviet Union  and we hope that the successful completion of these negotiations will create favourable conditions for progress towards disarmament and for a general improvement of the political atmosphere in the world.174.	Particularly topical in present conditions is the matter of the prohibition of the development and production of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons. The Geneva negotiations must be speeded up in order to reach international agreement in this field.175.	Of considerable significance for the achievement of nuclear disarmament are those measures designed- to strengthen the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is not difficult to imagine what would happen if the arsenals of the countries engaged in local conflicts  such as flare up in various parts of the planet from time to time  were to be stocked with nuclear weapons. This question becomes particularly acute in the light of the reports that the- racist regime of the Republic of South Africa plans to manufacture nuclear weapons. The appearance of such a weapon in the hands of the present regime of Pretoria would create an immediate danger for all African States as well as for world peace and security. Swift and effective action by the United Nations is needed to avert this danger.176.	During the present session  the Bulgarian delegation will join its efforts with those of other delegations that are trying to adopt measures to accelerate the preparation of an agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons and also to achieve progress on other partial measures. The entire activity of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and outside it continues to be focused on reaching the ultimate goal  which is general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.177.	The most vital task in the present-day international situation is undoubtedly that of strengthening detente  making irreversible the process of the relaxation of international tensions  and averting a nuclear conflict. Were mankind truly to resolve these problems  this last quarter of the twentieth century would be inscribed in gold in the history of our planet.178.	That is why we warmly welcome and fully support the Soviet Union's proposal to include on the agenda of the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly  as a matter of urgency and great importance  the item emptied ""Deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war"". It is our belief that the draft declaration on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and also the draft resolution on the prevention of the danger of nuclear war will receive the support of all peace-loving States and will serve as a basis for further development in the process of easing international tensions. The People's Republic of Bulgaria will do its utmost towards the realization of those proposals.179.	An important role in this respect is being played by the growing acknowledgement of the principle of the non-use of force or the threat of force in relations among States. Although there are some who cannot conceive of the contemporary world without the use of force and are even convinced that its prohibition would almost create a vacuum in the international legal order  it becomes increasingly evident that the conclusion of a world treaty on this matter would greatly advance the process of detente.180.	It is really quite difficult to talk about a complete improvement in the international climate when in various parts of the world there occur armed clashes which threaten to spread and engulf new territories. Regardless of the specific pretexts and reasons that give rise to those conflicts  there is no doubt that they are the result of imperialist policies based on the old principle of ""divide and rule""  and that their common aim is to undermine progressive political regimes.181.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be explosive. The main reason for the stalemate in the settlement of that conflict is the position taken by Israel  which  supported by its allies  is trying to maintain its illegal occupation of the Arab territories  as is evidenced by the establishment of new Israeli settlements on those lands. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria remains convinced that genuine peace in the Middle East is possible only under the following conditions: the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967; the exercise of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  inducing their right to an independent State; and respect for the independence  existence and security of all the countries in the area. We believe that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East should be reconvened  without any further procrastination  with the participation of all interested parties  including from the very outset  and with equal rights  the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.182.	The situation in southern Africa  where the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia continue to keep the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa in colonial bondage  is one of the most acute problems now facing the United Nations and the international community.183.	Hitherto  the efforts for the final elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism in Africa have run into stiff opposition not only on the part of the racist regimes but also on the part of some forces outside Africa which are helping those regimes. This is unequivocally confirmed by current attempts to distort the process of decolonization in order to preserve the positions of colonialism and imperialism in Africa.184.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to give full support to the struggle of the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe for the full and complete elimination of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid.185.	For us  the situation in Cyprus continues to be a source of concern. The People's Republic of Bulgaria unswervingly supports the kind of solution of the Cyprus question that will guarantee the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus in the interests of the Cypriot people—the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots—and in the interests of peace and security.186.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria favours the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korean soil and the peaceful reunification of Korea without outside interference.187.	As we all know  one of the purposes of the United Nations Charter is to promote international co-operation in defence of fundamental human rights and freedoms. Under the pretext of fighting for the materialization of this noble objective  certain groups are trying to arrogate to themselves the right to impose their own moral values upon other countries and peoples  thus flagrantly interfering in their internal affairs. At the same time  those groups undermine the United Nations collective endeavour to cut short the most brutal and massive violations of human rights  such as those in southern Africa  in Chile and in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories since 1967.188.	The problems of economic development and the reconstruction of international economic relations are closely linked with the establishment of peace and security in the world. To carry out this reconstruction on r. democratic basis and in order to eliminate all forms of discrimination and inequality  we must fulfil one of the important mandates of our times.189.	We support the just demands to find ways of overcoming the under-development and the grave economic situation of developing countries since we are fully aware that historic responsibility for this state of affairs rests with the former metropolitan Powers which have exploited those countries and which continue to amass enormous wealth within the framework of the international machinery which has been set up by them  and through unequal international economic relations.190.	In our relations with the developing countries  which are based on the principles of full equality  non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage and selfless aid  we are striving to the extent of our possibilities to assist their efforts to strengthen 'their political and economic independence  to consolidate their sovereignty over their natural resources  and to defend the fundamental interests of their own peoples.191.	The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches great significance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  whose work has now entered its crucial stage. Considerable efforts and political good will be needed  however  in order to bring the Conference to a successful end.192.	The question of the role of the United Nations and the ways to enhance its effectiveness has become recently the subject of increasing discussions  There are also attempts  under the guise of concern for the strengthening of the United Nations  to put forward concepts and views which if they were acted upon would yield the opposite result. In other words  they would result in undermining the foundations of the United Nations and its basic principles  and in weakening the international basis for peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems.193.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue in the future to support all efforts to make the United Nations more effective through strict observance of the purposes and principles of the Charter-a Charter which has stood the test of time-in order to make a better use of the possibilities contained in the Charter and to frustrate the attempts to have that document  as it were  ""revised"" and ""perfected.""194.	The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is fully aware of its responsibilities for peace and is therefore consistently implementing the provisions contained in the Final Act of Helsinki. We shall make all efforts at the forthcoming meeting in Belgrade to contribute to strengthening further peace and security in Europe  and to make this another link in the process of the ever-growing detente in the world. It is a happy fact that  as be judged by the preparatory work  the majority of the participants are interested in a positive dialogue at the meeting.195.	To make universal peace durable and lasting  to ensure that detente has the go-ahead-these are the objectives which the People's Republic of Bulgaria is trying to achieve throughout its activity both inside and outside the United Nations. Along with the other countries belonging to the socialist community  we put forward constructive solutions in order to achieve these purposes  in order to achieve and realize the noble objectives and aims of the United Nations."
"14",703,"BHR",32,1977,"﻿143.	 Your election  Sir  as President of the thirty- second session of the General Assembly is proof of your personal qualifications  and an indication of the high standing of your country  Yugoslavia  in the international community as one of the founding countries of the non-aligned movement of which my country is a member. I have the pleasure  therefore  on behalf of the delegation of Bahrain  to congratulate you warmly and to wish you success in this respect.144.	I should like to express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for the work he did as President of the thirty-first session  with his well-known ability and skill  which helped to make a success of the work of that session.145.	I should like  also  to express the appreciation of my Government for the ability shown by the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in carrying on the duties of his high post  at a time when the United Nations is expected to play an increasingly important role in international affairs. Mr. Waldheim has been able to serve faithfully the principles of our Organization and deploy unremitting efforts for their implementation.146.	The international Organization  in spite of the reverses and challenges it has encountered  has been able in the last 32 years to accomplish much of the work and objectives for which it was established. The Organization has made commendable efforts to preserve world peace and security  and has been able  by its timely intervention  to contain some local disputes and prevent them from deteriorating into global destructive wars. It has laid down the foundations of an integrated world system for the exchange of aid and technical knowledge among States in various fields. It has become truly an international forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of efforts among States to build a world in which peace and prosperity prevail.147.	No wonder that  after they attain independence  States hasten to join this international Organization  since they realize that no nation in this small world can live apart from other members of this family of nations. The membership of the Organization increases every year by the admission of States which have recently acceded to independence by the efforts of their own people  and through the efforts of the United Nations in resisting colonialism and increasing the momentum for the independence of nations.148.	I have the pleasure of welcoming at this session the admission to this Organization of the Republics of Djibouti and Viet Nam. I hope it will not be long before we see all other nations in the world which are still struggling for independence taking their place among us as Members of the Organization.149.	Since the thirty-first session of the General Assembly last year  the world has seen great political and economic events and developments. The annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization contains a deep and thorough analysis of the problems of the time  and shows clearly the possibilities open to the Organization  as well as the obstacles it faces. Our agenda for this session is replete with important matters which engage the attention of the international community. These are the grave problems facing us in southern Africa  the explosive situation in the Middle East  disarmament and the questions of dialogue between North and South.150.	This period in the history of humanity is characterized by the dialogue taking place between the nations and peoples of the world. The world has thus been able to avoid confrontation in many areas.151.	On this assumption  the Arab world has entered into a dialogue with Europe for the purpose of laying down the main foundations for mutual action by the two sides with a view to achieving economic  social and cultural development between the peoples of the Arab world and Europe. Such a dialogue  as well as the dialogue between the developing and industrialized countries  serves the causes of world peace and co-operation for the benefit of humanity at large.152.	On the same assumption  the First Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States  which was held in Cairo in March of this year  succeeded in laying down solid foundations and bases for co-operation and solidarity between the African peoples and the Arab world in the political  economic  social and cultural fields. The joint declarations which were issued at the end of the Conference [see A/32/61] made clear the joint political will and firm determination to work for the strengthening of the historical  civilizational and cultural ties between the Arab and African peoples  so that they may carry out their human mission of spreading peace  progress and well-being in the world.153.	The resources of the planet on which we live  although abundant  are nevertheless limited in view of the ever-increasing population of the world. The peace of the world depends on an equitable distribution of wealth  which requires the restructuring of present world economic relations and conditions. The wide gap between the standard of living of people in the third world and that of the people in the developed countries is a danger signal  which impedes security and progress in the world. Many of the inhabitants of the developing countries are still living in a state of poverty and malnutrition  threatening famine and the spread of disease. It is inconceivable that about three fourths of the population of the world in developing countries should be allocated less than one third of the total revenue of the world  while about one fourth of the population of the world in developed countries receives two thirds of the world's revenue. This situation cannot in the end benefit anyone  since the developing countries constitute the main market for the consumption of manufactured goods and export many basic commodities which are the life-blood of industry in developed countries and the source of their prosperity.154.	We have shown  since the sixth and seventh special sessions  the importance and need to narrow the vast gap between the wealthy nations in the North and the millions of poor people who live in the South. This can never be achieved unless \ e put an end to the painful conditions arising from the existence of very wealthy countries and others which are poor to the degree of deprivation  and unless we establish a new world economic order based on justice and equity and the right of all States and peoples to enjoy full sovereignty over their natural resources.155.	The results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  the North-South dialogue held in Paris last June  which attracted the attention of the whole world  fell short of expectations with regard to laying down a comprehensive and equitable programme for international economic co-operation as an effective contribution to the development of the third world. The Conference was a good opportunity for the industrialized and developing countries to prove their good intentions concerning the establishment of a new international economic order to replace the current unjust order of the concepts and rules governing commercial dealings between the industrialized and developing countries.156.	The position of the developing countries participating in the Conference was characterized by flexibility and moderation. These countries have proved that their intention was not to transform the Conference into a confrontation with the industrialized countries. On the contrary  their stand was characterized by wisdom  logic  frankness and moderation. We hope that constructive discussions and good intentions will prevail during our discussions in this session on the results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  so that the Conference may reach the noble goal which we all work for: namely  the establishment of the new international economic order based on justice  equity and equality among the States of the world. It is our hope that the industrialized States will show more flexibility and understanding of the position of the developing countries  so that we may reach more constructive results in the field of international cooperation  and so that the industrialized countries may contribute effectively to the development of the third world  particularly through allowing the developing countries to participate effectively and freely in the utilization of technology and industrialization  as well as establishing an order which strikes a balance between the prices of basic commodities and raw materials exported by developing countries and those of manufactured goods and technology imported by such countries.157.	Racism and racial discrimination has been one of the problems confronting the- United Nations since its establishment. It is completely inconsistent with the principles and Charter of the United Nations. How  one may ask  can the United Nations permit a Member State recklessly to violate  day in and day out  the resolutions and Charter of the United Nations in this respect? The policy of racial discrimination  based on the domination of one race over another  which is being practised openly and deliberately by the governing regime in South Africa and the illegal governing regime in Southern Rhodesia  is contrary to the main principles underlying the United Nations. It is a flagrant breach of its Charter  and an internationally outrageous violation of basic human rights  which cannot conceivably be committed by a Member State in the Organization.158.	Therefore we participated in the issuance of a statement by the Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries at their extraordinary meeting in New York on 30 September last  on the current situation in southern Africa and the ever increasing brutal repression of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa by the racist colonialist authorities. We appeal to all States to respond to the contents of that statement.159.	Bahrain has consistently supported the rights of oppressed peoples and countries to self-determination and independence and the application of the principles of equality  equal opportunities and justice for all races of the world without exception  irrespective of colour  race  origin or faith. We have on more than one occasion and in more than one assembly condemned absolutely the policies of apartheid and racial discrimination wherever and however they are applied  particularly those of the racist regimes in South Africa  Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.160.	I should like now to move on to the question of complete and comprehensive disarmament. It is one of the important questions taking a prime place in the discussions and work of the General Assembly at each and every session. There are about 20 items on this session's agenda on the question of disarmament  which clearly shows the importance Member States attach to it. This led the non-aligned countries at the last session to submit a proposal for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to study this question in all its aspects.161.	The arms race is one of the most important problems facing the world today  particularly the developing world. The huge arsenals of conventional  nuclear  chemical and biological weapons which some States build cause increasing concern because they threaten the existence of humanity on our small planet and stimulate the outbreak of wars among States. It is indeed regrettable that huge amounts of money should every year be dissipated on the development of destructive conventional and strategic weapons instead of being spent on development projects and on alleviating the burden of indebtedness of the poor countries. It is estimated that this year about $300 billion has been spent on armaments-at a time when the majority of people in our world are living in hunger  squalor and deprivation.162.	In the Middle East we find Israel building a huge arsenal of weapons to consolidate its occupation of the land of States Members of this Organization  refusing to recognize the rights of the people of Palestine and acting as a fortress for continuous aggression and expansion at the expense of others.163.	Obviously the reduction of arms of all kinds and the non-development of new weapons would provide huge financial resources that could be used for development projects  in particular to raise the standard of living of the people of the developing countries.164.	The danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons increases every year. There are indications that both Israel and South Africa possess the ability to make a nuclear weapon. The ability of those two racist regimes in Palestine and South Africa to possess and to make nuclear weapons endangers international peace and security not only in the Middle East and on the African continent but all over the world. Therefore we consider it the duty of the international community represented in this hall to spare no effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to ban all nuclear experiments  as well as to prevent the production and use of many destructive weapons  including biological and chemical weapons.165.	Bahrain has on more than one occasion unreservedly supported the proposal for the Middle East to become a nuclear-weapon-free zone and for the Indian Ocean and all its natural extensions to be a zone of permanent peace and security. Therefore in our area  in the Gulf  we have started to engage in contacts and dialogues with all the States lying on the Gulf to establish the bases for mutual co-operation to keep the area far removed from the dangers involved in the rivalries of outside States. We therefore support the proposal for the holding of a conference to put into effect the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  provided thorough preparations are made for the conference.166.	We hope that the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament to be held next spring will be able to deal with all matters of disarmament without exception and will strive to reach the goal of disarmament for development.167.	Almost 30 years have now elapsed  and the people of Palestine are still outside their land and home. When  in November 1947  the Organization adopted the resolution on the partition of Palestine  international Zionism sheltered behind that resolution to attack the Arab people of Palestine within their own home and expel them  from the land of their fathers and forefathers. The Palestinian people were then unarmed and without Government administration. They were in fact still under the mandate of the international community as represented by this Organization. Therefore the international Organization bears a special responsibility towards Palestine and its people.168.	Since those tragic events the Organization has adopted numerous resolutions calling for the return of the Palestinians to their homes  compensation for their losses and the guaranteeing of the exercise of their lawful and inalienable rights of sovereignty in their country. But Israel has flatly rejected all those resolutions; it has usurped the land of the people of Palestine  expelled them from Palestine by cruel force  and replaced them with foreign immigrants to establish a racist regime supported by imperialism.169.	Israel has not stopped at that. In June 1967 it occupied the remaining parts of Palestine and other territories of neighbouring Arab lands in pursuit of the Zionist expansionist policy in the Middle East. Israel then requisitioned Arab lands in occupied Palestine  expelled their inhabitants and changed their nature so as to establish settlements for the new immigrants who are still pouring in. The number of such settlements established on occupied lands since June 1967 amounts to 85.170.	The establishment of such settlements on occupied land is increasing day after day. The settlements are spread over the occupied land of Palestine and neighbouring Arab States. They stand as proof of the colonialist and racist intentions of Israel in the area. They have been established to serve as fortresses to consolidate the existence of Israel in the area  to implement its expansionist policies and to disperse Arab families in the occupied land. They have been built in strategic positions  proving the evil intentions of Israel and its determination to remain in the occupied territories forever. These intentions are no secret to anyone  particularly after the recent declarations of the rulers of Israel that any Israeli has the right to settle in the occupied land of Palestine  that being  part of the Israeli heritage .171.	Israel has taken severe repress; measures against the Arab population in the occupied territories and has thrown many of its members into gaol  where they are subjected to the worst types of torture  contrary to all basic human rights. All such measures are contrary to the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  and to the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning solution of the pending crisis and the non-alteration of the legal status of the occupied territories  which consider all such measures null and void. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has more than once condemned Israel for violating the said Geneva Convention in the occupied Arab territories and considers such violations to be war crimes and an affront to humanity.172.	The expansionist policy of Israel in the area is the most dangerous threat to peace and security in the world. The situation is explosive and threatens the outbreak of a destructive war whose repercussions would extend to other areas of the world. The regrettable events in the Middle East are no more than a result of the tension prevailing in the area  which Israel exploits in order to pursue  openly or secretly  its aggressive policy and its intervention in the affairs of the neighbouring Arab countries. In this respect responsibility is borne by States which support Israel and supply it with military and material aid and condone its violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.173.	The obstinacy of Israel in its rejection of the rights of the Palestinian people is no more than a manoeuvre to block the peaceful settlement of the question of the Middle East. The main problem is the case of Palestine and the Palestinian people and their right to exist as a people in their land and home. The occupation by Israel of parts of the neighbouring Arab countries is no more than the result of its expansionist policy in the area. The solution of this problem as a whole lies in the complete withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab lands occupied since 1967  the return of the Palestinian people to their homes  and the granting to them of the same right to self-determination as that of any other people  through their representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization.174.	We therefore call for efforts to be intensified and world opinion to be marshalled to compel Israel to implement the resolutions of this Organization and to respond to the endeavours made to solve this problem by peaceful means  and for the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the presence of all parties concerned including - the Palestine Liberation Organization.175.	We appeal to all the States of the world  with no exception  to halt all economic and military aid to Israel and to refrain from giving it any help which would inevitably lead to perpetuating the present situation and would encourage Israel to continue its aggression against the rights of the Palestinian people and the occupied Arab territories.176.	It is indeed regrettable that the Security Council has not been able this year to consider the report and recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the last session by resolution 31/20.177.	We call upon the Security Council to put an end to all the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  which threaten world peace with the gravest of consequences  and to take the necessary steps to revoke all Israeli measures imposed in this respect  particularly those relating to annexation  colonization and Judaization.178.	Israel has violated the United Nations Charter and its resolutions ever since it was first admitted to this Organization. It is well known that Israel's admission to the United Nations by resolution 273 (III) was subject to the following two conditions: first  that Israel undertake to respectfully the United Nations Charter as from the date of its admission to the United Nations; and  secondly  that it carry out the provisions of resolution 181 (II) on partition  and resolution 194(111) permitting the Palestinians to return to their homes. The Foreign Minister of Israel understood at the time to accept both conditions.179.	It is clear that the undertaking of the Foreign Minister of Israel was not genuine from the start. Israel has not honoured either of those two conditions. It has occupied since that time territories more than four times the area allotted to it under resolution 181 (II) and has not implemented resolution 194(111) relating to the return of the Palestinians to their homes.180.	As preliminary measures to stop Israel from continuing its dangerous policy in the Middle East  we have sponsored the draft resolution submitted by the Arab Republic of Egypt at this session on recent illegal Israeli measures in the occupied Arab territories. We have also adopted the two declarations issued by the Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries and the Foreign Ministers of  the Islamic countries in their extraordinary meetings held in New York on 30 September and 3 October of this year  respectively  on the situation in the Middle East and the question of Palestine In the light of recent developments. We appeal to all States in this Organization to support the aforementioned draft resolution and to respond to the call made in the above-mentioned Declarations of the Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries and the Foreign Ministers of the Islamic countries. We also call upon States which have influence with Israel to take a decisive stand for the solution of the problem and not merely to confine their role to mediation in the dispute.181.	Our stand with regard to all these matters is derived from our firm belief in the principles and human objectives of the United Nations and our desire to co-operate with all peace-loving States within the system of the United Nations to build a more progressive world in which justice  security and prosperity will prevail. "
"15",813,"BLR",32,1977,"﻿35.	It has been repeatedly stressed from this rostrum at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly that the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia was the main event of the twentieth century  one which radically changed the course of development of all humanity. The first socialist State in the world came into existence 60 years ago. Since that time socialism  which has become a world-wide system  has brought to the peoples of the world peace  freedom  new equitable relations and mutually beneficial co-operation.36.	The outstanding achievements of the land of Soviets and the successful implementation of the peace-loving"" Leninist foreign policy of the Soviet State have become an important factor in the acceleration of the world-wide revolutionary process and social progress. The magnificence of the October Revolution is undying indeed. It is embodied in the historic successes of the land of socialism  the first in the world  and of all States of the socialist community  in the victory over the dark forces of fascism in the Second War  in the collapse of the colonial system of imperialism  in the consolidation of the principles of peaceful coexistence in the relations of States with different social systems  and of the ideals of peace and friendship among peoples.37.	The world-wide historic forces of socialism and progress brought into being by the great October Revolution are growing and becoming stronger; they have multiplied many times over their influence in the world and have established an entirely attainable and realistic objective— that of eliminating the danger of a new world war and of radically restructuring the whole system of international relations on the basis of democratic principles. The Soviet Union  together with the fraternal socialist States  is waging an untiring struggle to achieve this objective. Indeed  the whole history of Soviet foreign policy is literally pervaded by the struggle for peace and equitable international co-operation—from the historic Leninist Decree on Peace to the programme of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for freedom and independence of the peoples  adopted by the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.38.	The peace-loving foreign policy of the Soviet State has been enshrined in the new Constitution of the USSR. Every line of its section on foreign policy reflects its noble goals and defines specific ways of further strengthening the security of the peoples and the development of broad international co-operation.39.	The most noticeable changes in international relations have occurred in recent years. The process of restructuring international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence is gaining increasing momentum  and detente is emerging as the dominant trend in world politics  thereby diminishing the danger of a new world war and opening the way for further development of comprehensive co-operation. All this is a result of the joint struggle of the States of the socialist community and other peace-loving countries in the world arena in general and in the United Nations in particular.40.	Comrade L. I. Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  stated:""Current international development is characterized by great dynamism. The opportunities for strengtheningpeace are growing—and growing irresistibly	 Wefirmly believe that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately prevail and that mankind will be able to step into the twenty-first century in conditions of peace  more secure than ever before.""41.	In their struggle for peace  for the deepening of the process of international detente and for its extension to all parts of the world  the States of the socialist community have taken the initiative and are rendering unfailing support to United Nations efforts to prevent war  strengthen international security and develop co-operation among States  in accordance with the provisions of its Charter.42.	Of extreme importance to the cause of peace is the item  ""Deepening and consolidation of international detente and the prevention of the danger of nuclear war"" included in the agenda of this session at the request of the Soviet Union By approving the draft declaration on the deepening and consolidation of international detente proposed by the USSR and the draft resolution on the prevention of the danger of nuclear war the General Assembly would demonstrate the commitment of the States Members of the United Nations to detente and their determination to carry out a broad range of measures aimed at fleshing out the bones of detente with specific material content in the most diverse fields.43.	These documents should become a sort of code of conduct and a programme of concerted efforts on the part of all States in the interest of peace  security and co-operation among peoples.44.	By building upon what has already been achieved  and by making efforts to achieve the universal participation of States in the multilateral treaties and agreements now in force and their implementation in good faith  the United Nations can set itself such goals and settle such problems as the prevention of the danger of nuclear war  the containment of the arms race  disarmament  the elimination of conflict situations and of the vestiges of colonialism and racism  the deepening and expansion of international co-operation on the basis of the non-use of force in international relations  equality  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  and the strengthening of the feelings of friendship  co-operation and mutual trust among all peoples.45.	It is quite obvious that detente is necessary for all countries which participate in normal international relations; it brings benefits to all those who are concerned about peace.46.	But the road to peace has never been an easy one  and the present state of affairs proves this. The arms race is continuing  and more and more States are involved in it. A hostile propaganda campaign is being waged against socialist countries in certain circles.47.	There is no more urgent or vital task than that of making peace durable and unbreakable and of making detente universal  general and irreversible. Any State  whatever its size  can and must have a say in the deepening and advancement of the noble cause of detente  and it is only through the joint efforts of States and peoples  by overcoming the resistance of the forces of war and reaction  that it will be possible to achieve the strengthening of universal peace and the transformation of detente into an irreversible process  and to bring about a restructuring of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.48.	Of practical importance to the cause of peace would be the beginning of negotiations  and the conclusion of a World Treaty on the Non-Use of Force in International Relations  as proposed by the Soviet Union and provided for in the pertinent resolution of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. In the conditions of the current international situation  the implementation of additional measures to ensure strict implementation of the principle of the non-use of force and to make it an immutable law in international relations is an urgent and important task in die interests of all States. The conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force would promote the creation of favourable conditions for curbing the arms race and for making progress towards disarmament  the further deepening of detents and the prevention of nuclear or any other kind of war.49.	The implementation of the proposal of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  that all participants in theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against one another  together with the implementation of the measures proposed by the Soviet Union in the draft resolution on prevention of the danger of nuclear war  would play an important part in reducing the threat of nuclear war and in further improving the whole international political climate.50.	We can judge the state and the development of the international situation primarily by the degree to which we succeed in moving forward towards the strengthening of peace and the elimination of the threat of nuclear war. Certain positive results have been achieved in recent years in that respect. A number of multilateral treaties and agreements limiting the arms race in certain areas are now in force. We should add to these the well-known bilateral agreements  such as the Soviet-American agreement on the prevention of nuclear war  and the Soviet-French agreement on the prevention of the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons.51.	However  peace on our planet is not yet as durable as it should be in the light of the situation in today's world.52.	The prospect of further proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a serious danger to the cause of peace. The most urgent and effective efforts on the part of the United Nations  and of all States  are essential to prevent the production of such weapons in The Republic of South Africa and to prevent their emergence in other countries.53.	Among the major and urgent tasks whose achievement is awaited by the peoples of the world of central importance are  of course  curbing the arms race  and the transition from amassing stockpiles of ever more deadly means of destruction to beginning their limitation and undertaking disarmament.54.	The continuation and even intensification of the arms race are threatening the further development of detente. As we stressed in the message of L. I. Brezhnev  to the participants of the World Forum of Peace Forces  meeting in Moscow from 14 to 16 January 1977:""Without even mentioning the direct danger of nuclear catastrophe  the arms race is in itself a senseless waste of the material and spiritual resources of mankind  of which it has such need in fighting hunger  disease and illiteracy  and in solving social problems  and problems of energy  raw materials and the ecology.""55.	The history of the foreign policy of the Soviet State is a story of consistent and tireless struggle for disarmament. The fact remains that the Soviet Union has submitted more than 70 proposals on questions of disarmament for the consideration of international organizations and the Governments of other countries. All main initiatives in this field have come  and are still coming  from the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community. The  stubborn resistance to any changes for the better or to the implementation of specific proposals comes from the military-industrial complex in Western countries and the political circles connected with them  as well as from the Peking leadership. At the same time  in the course of the current wide-ranging lively discussion on the questions of disarmament  one can glimpse an approach which is not conducive to progress towards their solution. There are certain people who  disregarding the facts of life  are pretending to be as it were the initiators in some questions of military detente. At the same time  they are resisting the implementation initiatives already approved by the United Nations on questions of disarmament  or are putting forward proposals which fall short of the principle of equality and equal security  and are thereby endangering the security of other countries.56.	The progress that we have achieved in recent years in implementing a number of partial measures is convincing proof that if there is real determination  the problems of disarmament can be solved. One of the latest examples of this is the signing  in May of this year  of the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques We firmly believe that the earliest possible entry into force of this Convention  with the broadest possible participation of States Members of the United Nations  would be a further step towards limiting and curtailing the arms race  and would be in keeping with the interests of the security of all peoples and the interests of the protection of human environment.57.	There are important proposals on the strengthening of peace and disarmament now on the negotiating table. Negotiations are under way on the reduction of armed force? and armaments in Central Europe  and also on the limitation of the strategic armaments of the USSR and the United States of America. In Belgrade there is the meeting of the representatives of States which participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We hope that concern for peace and security in Europe and for the development of co-operation among European peoples will be the main item before this meeting.58.	The principal guidelines for the co-ordinated actions of States in the field of disarmament were set down clearly in the memorandum of the Soviet Union on questions relating to the ending of the arms race and disarmament  submitted for the consideration of the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. They were also reflected in the document entitled ""Basic provisions of the programme of action on disarmament""6 submitted recently by the socialist countries for the consideration of the  Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament. In this document the socialist countries urge States Members of the United Nations to strive for appropriate international agreements in the following main areas: cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament; prevention of the danger of nuclear war; complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests; all possible means of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons;prohibition and destruction of stockpiles of chemical weapons; prohibition of the creation of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction; creation of zones free from nuclear weapons and zones of peace; limitations and reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments; reduction of military budgets; full demilitarization of the sea-bed and ocean floor; regional measures of military detente and disarmament.59.	Our task now is to proceed to the implementation of broader and deeper measures than hitherto in all the fundamental problems of disarmament.60.	This session of the General Assembly must provide further momentum for the completion of work on the preparation of an international agreement on the prohibition of the creation of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. This problem has now become even more urgent because specific steps are being taken in the opposite direction. The duty of the United Nations is to associate itself with the world-wide protest against the creation of new types of weapons of mass destruction. We note with satisfaction that in the course of the general debate many delegations have been condemning plans for the creation of the neutron bomb.61.	The elimination of existing hotbeds of tension is indispensable in the straggle for peace and international security. That is why the Byelorussian SSR most strongly favours the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression in the Middle East A just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only on the basis of the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967  the implementation of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including its right to self-determination and the creation of its own State  the ensuring of the right of all States directly participating in the conflict to an independent existence and security.62.	The path to the solution of the problem of the Middle East lies through the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East which  in our view  must resume its work as soon as possible with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.63.	We must strive for a solution to the problem of Cyprus on the basis of unconditional respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and respect for its policy of non-alignment  the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of Cyprus and non-interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus  as is provided for in Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.64.	In the struggle for a further improvement of the international political climate  for the strengthening of international security and the progress of detente  it is not enough to confine ourselves to the elimination of existing armed conflicts and hotbeds of tension. It is no less important to prevent the creation of new ones. 65.	Because of the racists and their imperialist protectors  one of the flash-points on our planet is southern Africa. Peace and security here can be achieved only through the elimination of the domination of the racist regimes and the genuine  and not the fictitious  liberation of the peoples of the area. The United Nations must continue its policy of isolation and boycott of the illegal regimes of The Republic of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  of full eradication of apartheid  of ensuring the independence and sovereignty of Zimbabwe and Namibia and of full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples including  as applicable  to small colonial possessions and enclaves.66.	Since the very beginning of their existence the socialist States have constantly striven and continue to strive for the development of broad commercial  economic  scientific and technological co-operation with all countries on an equal  mutually advantageous and democratic basis. We are convinced that the solution of today's urgent economic problems in the interests of all the peoples of the world is possible mainly by observance of the principle of the sovereignty of every country over its natural resources  of the right of every people freely and without impediment to choose its own path of development and by the elimination of the exploitation of the peoples of developing countries by foreign capital and transnational corporations. In these circumstances the aspirations of developing countries for the establishment of just and equal international economic co-operation can become feasible. In this regard I should like to point out that the successful economic development of the Soviet Union and other States of the socialist community has created propitious conditions for the further development of their foreign economic links with all countries.67.	The society of developed socialism built in the Soviet State is opening up ever more fully its life-giving and creative forces. In celebrating the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution  we cannot fail to emphasize the outstanding successes which have marked the development of the Byelorussian SSR during this period. The economy of the Byelorussian SSR is developing at a stable and high rate of growth. In less than two days the Republic now produces as much industrial output as it had in the course of a whole year before the Revolution. This has been achieved in circumstances when during the years of the Fascist invasion the industries of the Republic were in actual fact completely destroyed. The steady increase of public production and the growth of its efficiency have ensured further progress towards a solution of the main socio-economic problems-the raising of the standard of living for working people.68.	The achievements of our people in the political  social  economic and cultural spheres have been made possible because of the advantages of the socialist system. Socialism is the most just way of organizing society in the interests of the working people. It is a system which is a stranger to economic crisis  unemployment and inflation. It is precisely these factors which are decisive and which in the most direct way determine the status of man in society; the social and economic conditions of his life and the purport and content of human rights.69.	The tremendous gains and successes of the Soviet people achieved during the years of Soviet power have been strikingly embodied in the new Constitution of the USSR  the articles and provisions of which prove that in our country  in which a society of genuine humanism and genuine democracy has been created  the fundamental rights proclaimed by the Great October Revolution have been confirmed and guaranteed. ""It is precisely socialism which for the first time in human history has ensured for all such fundamental human rights as the right to work  education  the protection of health  housing  social security and leisure and active participation in the government of State affairs.70.	The fruitful co-operation of States in the field of encouragement and development of human rights is possible only through the observance of the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in their internal affairs  the adoption and the fulfilment of international undertakings by all and the struggle against massive and gross violations of human rights in southern Africa  Chile and the occupied Arab territories.71.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR attaches great importance to the question of the protection of persons detained or imprisoned for their struggle for self- determination  independence and social progress  against colonialism  aggression and foreign occupation  racism  apartheid and racial discrimination. At last year's session of the General Assembly our delegation submitted a draft resolution on this question  and we shall now seek to secure its adoption.72.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has repeatedly set forth its position of principle on the question of the Charter of the United Nations  and our position is this: that we have consistently favoured an increase in the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as an important instrument for the strengthening of peace and international security on the basis  not of the revision  but of the strict observance of the provisions of the United Nations Charter.73.	The United Nations is the most representative and influential international organization in which the peoples of the world have placed high hopes. Its authority and its degree of influence over the course of events in the world are determined primarily by the way in which it fulfils its principal task—fostering the maintenance of international peace and security  and preventing a new war. It is precisely this—an active role in the world-wide struggle for the elimination of the danger of war and  above all  the prevention of nuclear war—that the peoples of the world expect from the United Nations. It is our common duty to justify these hopes and  in conditions of increasing international detente supplemented by measures for military detente and disarmament  .to strive to solve all remaining problems  from the elimination of the vestiges of racism  colonialism and the hotbeds of tension to achieving the goals of the economic and social progress of the peoples of the world.

"16",895,"BOL",32,1977,"﻿233.	 To bring Bolivia's voice once again to theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations  this universal parliament of historic dimensions where the problems and concerns of the world are discussed  is a great honour and an opportunity to reaffirm my country's support for the basic tenets of our Organization. Solidarity  equality  fraternal collaboration  justice and the defence of peace are basic rules which guide our country in its conduct in international relations.234.	We would also like to emphasize our country's spirit of hope. We wish to make a definite contribution towards realizing the aims of the international community in bringing about a better future for mankind. Our contribution in this world forum will bear the stamp of co-operation and solidarity. Our work is aimed towards ensuring that justice and peace prevail in an increasingly interdependent world.235.	In my statement in this general debate  I wish to express the thanks and congratulations of the Government of Bolivia to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who  at an important stage of our work  chaired the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.236.	Also on behalf of my country I wish to welcome the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly  Mr. Lazar Mojsov  whose election fully guarantees that our deliberations will lead to a constructive dialogue.237.	My Government once again wishes to compliment the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on his work in support of peace and understanding in the world. His devotion has earned the appreciation of the international community.238.	On behalf of the Republic of Bolivia  I wish to welcome the countries that have recently become Members of the United Nations. We know that they will join with us in our efforts to achieve the objectives of our Organization. The admission to membership of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and Djibouti means that we are continuing towards the goal of the universality of our Organization  which Bolivia fervently supports.239.	We are convinced that one of the great achievements of the international community is the dialogue that the General Assembly has made possible. Here we have discussed the most critical problems of the world  we have considered the aspirations of the peoples of the world and we have tried to bring about a world in which we can live together in security  peace and co-operation. On this occasion we are faced with problems of differing magnitude and urgency  and our will for an understanding must be unflagging and in keeping with the principles which for the past 32 years have remained unchanged. Those principles are our chosen weapons in trying to bring about a less tormented future.240.	We are particularly concerned over one problem that troubles the entire world. The policy of racial discrimination and apartheid is an offence against our sense of justice. Its continuation makes it difficult for us to consider that the international community has brought about human solidarity and a high level of civilization. Hence we believe that the struggle for liberation which various peoples have been waging in an attempt to bring about genuine independence and nationhood is closely related to the universal struggle here to set aside practices of intolerance. Bolivia has traditionally supported these efforts.241.	The problems which arise from those policies take many forms. For that reason we should like to make special mention of resolution 1514 (XV)  which stresses the principle of the self-determination of peoples. In a vast area of the world  efforts to bring about self-determination also mean the fight against racial discrimination.242.	We also wish to express our concern over the conflict in the Middle East. The lack of a settlement there endangers peace not only in that area but in the entire world. For that reason Bolivia wishes to reiterate its support for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which laid down the basic and adequate guidelines for a permanent peace  taking into account the interests of all those involved in the conflict. The return of occupied territory  the acceptance of the rights of the peoples of that area and recognition of the existence of all the States involved in the conflict are fundamental factors for a just and final settlement.243.	In keeping with our peace-loving traditions and our inclination to support dialogue  we believe that a delegation of Palestinian people must also participate in the Geneva Conference seeking a realistic solution of the problem of the Middle East. Only thus will all voices be heard  all rights accepted and all aspirations taken into account  so that there can be brought in the region an atmosphere of peace and civilized understanding.244.	Once again  with great regret  we must draw attention to the turn that the arms race has taken. Weapons of mass destruction have gone beyond what we can conceive  and  what is also very serious  their proliferation has consumed resources to the detriment of the expectations of developing peoples for progress and higher standards of living. This is a concern of long standing  but it remains crucial.245.	I should like to reiterate our alarm at the fact that the arms race has extended to some less developed countries and thus has converted certain areas  including the American continent  into hotbeds of tension. The arms race must be replaced by a world-wide commitment not to use force in international relations. At this stage of civilization  it is incomprehensible that mankind can reject dialogue and understanding in favour of regressive positions based on destruction and death. A commitment to reject force  which could take the form of a historic treaty for mankind  would gain our full support. For that reason we support the proposal that a world disarmament conference should ban the use of environmental modification techniques for military or other hostile purposes  such as already agreed at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.246.	My country's love of peace and humanitarian feelings prompts us to reiterate our concern over the problem of terrorism  which we regard as one form of violation of human rights. Indeed I wish to say that this escalation of irrational and systematized violence cannot be considered a valid means of making legitimate any political  economic or social claims. The anguish of world public opinion over innocent victims of terrorist practices should move the international community to seek machinery not only to punish those who use those ignoble weapons but also to prevent acts which offend mankind's deepest feelings in this second half of the twentieth century.247.	We are concerned not only over the fact that human rights are brutally violated by terrorist actions; we are also concerned over any other use of force  practice or method which hinders the full self-realization of man  limits his freedom or prevents his access to well-being  security or the fruits of progress. This conviction and Bolivia's active participation in efforts to protect human dignity have prompted us to become a sponsor of the proposal for the establishment of one of the most important posts the United Nations -could offer the world in this area: that of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.248.	In Latin America  we are convinced that there is now a growing awareness of the need for our part of the world to participate in the settlement of conflicts and world-wide problems. Latin America has begun recently to project a more unified image  one which arises from similar origins  hopes and historical experiences.249.	The gradual integration of Latin America not only has been aimed at broadening markets and economic understanding but also  little by little  it has been creating a genuine political solidarity  which will make possible consistent unified action in international affairs. It is true that the final goal has not yet been achieved. But it is also true that there is the conviction that the role which Latin American countries must play in the solution of problems affecting mankind must be a very important one.250.	Latin American efforts to unify the action of the countries of our group  have been traditional efforts. We have tried to perfect a world system that would ensure peace  understanding and co-operation. Thus  in the Security Council  we have always tried  through a concerted policy  to achieve higher levels of progress and eliminate any situation which might undermine the just aspirations of the peoples of the world.251.	In the interests of that form of co-ordination in particular  Bolivia  two years ago  withdrew its candidacy in the Security Council for the present two-year period  in favour of another Latin American country. We were convinced that by contributing in this way to inter- American unity we were thus winning full support for our claim at the thirty-second session of the General Assembly from our group and from all countries in this Organization. The election of Bolivia to the Security Council would be further proof of Latin American unity  since there can be no rift in a homogeneous region without the risk of a loss of cohesiveness.252.	On- another subject  Latin America  together with the other countries of the third world  wishes to see industrialization gradually eliminating the causes of dependence. We are aware that if that is to take place  we must agree to eliminate the most important factors in economic dependence. In this area  I should like to state that among the matters that have caused the greatest concern are the prices of raw materials and stability in the supply of raw materials.253.	For those reasons  we attribute special importance to the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. We see it as a real attempt to establish a new order in this field. Although the North-South dialogue did not achieve certain fundamental goals  it did have certain positive aspects: to wit  the reaffirmation of the integrated programme for commodities and the agreement to create a common financing fund  in addition to other measures which will become increasingly important in the future as we try to satisfy the interests of all nations.254.	Furthermore  the very fact that the North-South dialogue was transferred to the United Nations framework is a significant step because it brings into the world Organization one of the dramatic problems of relations between the developed world and less favoured nations. This forum had always been intended as the place where conflicting positions could be resolved and an understanding reached.255.	As I already stated  Latin America shares its concerns with other countries belonging to the third world. Bolivia in particular agrees with the important conclusions which have been reached by various countries in the non-aligned movement and  in particular  we concur in the discontent with the present situation in international economic affairs and with the decision to develop financial and monetary co-operation among all countries which have been adversely affected by that international economic order which we consider unjust and which we want replaced by a more equitable system.256.	In the political arena  Latin America has to its credit one of the most important achievements in the solution of one of the more important problems affecting our continent. Thus it has been that the formulation of new treaties relating to the Panama Canal  based on sovereignty  mutual respect and international justice  is undeniable proof that there are no problems which cannot be settled provided the parties involved in any difference of opinion or unjust situation show a sincere and clear political will.257.	The spirit which has prevailed between Panama and the United States is a triumph of understanding and a reaffirmation of the fact that there is no hurdle which cannot be cleared  that there is no difficulty which cannot be removed.258.	Our natural satisfaction at the settlement of this problem  which closely affects countries that are dear to us  makes it even clearer to us that other problems of equal importance deserve a similar treatment. We must approach them with a sense of justice  with a desire to bring about an understanding. When a genuine problem is satisfactorily settled  it benefits not only those who are directly affected but also the entire international community.259.	Such matters must be settled taking into account historical and ethical factors which must be continuously borne in mind. Bolivia has had to deal with a problem which has of late become particularly dramatic  for it pertains to our relations with the rest of the countries of the world  which are now limited and have been for nearly a hundred years by the fact that we are hemmed in as a geographical enclave.260.	We are convinced that dialogue is the supreme instrument for settling international disputes. My country has always shown a desire to reach understandings and to work for settlements that take its vital interests into account as we deal with the problem of our geographical confinement.261.	The lapse of time has  of course  aroused a certain impatience but at the same time it has been a severe test of good faith in negotiations and in this task of bringing about a historical solution which will be an honour to all of America. We are convinced that our continent believes that the restoration to the Bolivian nation of an outlet to the sea is a matter which can no longer be postponed without jeopardizing our oft-proclaimed solidarity.262.	If the unity of our continent means anything at all  it means that Bolivia's isolation limits the effectiveness of its internal efforts to promote economic and social development and limits its participation in the process of integration of Latin America.263.	However  we shall take advantage of every means which may present itself. Furthermore  we are prepared to search for any way of facilitating a solution  but not one which would undermine that solution. The moral authority of the continent must not be adversely affected by lack of understanding. Bolivia's need for an outlet to the sea is a reality recognized by all America. And those who wish to satisfy that need must act soon so that the decisions of our countries will become a historical fact leading to the strengthening of justice  peace and co-operation in Latin America.264.	We believe that any attitudes which disrupt the dialogue will not contribute effectively to the fair and dispassionate settlement of Bolivia's vital problem that its undeniable importance merits. likewise  matters must be clarified as much as possible in order to facilitate a viable settlement. Hence my Government is still waiting for Chile to obtain Peru's consent in order to open the way to a settlement that will meet the expectations of the Bolivian people and the requirements of justice in today's world.265.	The United Nations cannot  in its universality  confine itself to problems which are considered acute crises of global dimensions. Nor can certain situations be dealt with superficially or indifferently  since  although they may seemingly be limited to only one region  they can have an effect on peace and the ideal of harmonious coexistence.266.	The goal of solving Bolivia's problem of geographical isolation also warrants effective action by our world Organization. This would be in keeping with its duty to fulfil  without reservations  one of its primary responsibilities: that of improving relations among neighbouring countries.267.	Bolivia's thinking  its efforts and its international position  in keeping with our desire for peace and co-operation  are being expressed at this time  when our country is engaged in the task of economic and social development. The Government of our country  presided over by H.E. General Don Hugo Banzer Suarez  faithfully reflects the accomplishments and just aspirations of the Bolivian people. The firm support of the main segments of our population  especially the support of the farmers and workers  attests to the popular and nationalist basis of the Bolivian Government.268.	Development in my country is viewed as an instrument in the service of society. Our actions derive from a humanitarian  revolutionary and authentically Bolivian nationalism.269.	For the past six years  the Government of Bolivia  thanks to political stability  social justice and collective effort  has made surprising progress in all spheres of national activity. This allows us to envisage a process of institutionalization of the country that will promote a national reorganization in keeping with the needs of the people and create an appropriate basis for progress towards the constitutionalization stage. This  in turn  will permit the Bolivian nation to consolidate its development in accordance with its new situation.270.	May I conclude by expressing to those countries assembled here Bolivia's hope that we will realize our common aspiration to shape for mankind a destiny free of violence  based on understanding and exalted by justice."
"17",942,"BRA",32,1977,"﻿1.	Mr. President  permit me to express to you the satisfaction of the Brazilian delegation at seeing you presiding over this session of the General Assembly. I bring you our congratulations on your unanimous election to this high office.2.	I also wish to express the appreciation of my delegation for the manner in which Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe conducted the work of the thirty-first session.3.	Brazil supports the principle of the universality of the Organization  to the fulfilment of which we draw nearer each passing year. It is  therefore  always a pleasure to mark the admission of new Member States to the United Nations as we now do in the case of Viet Nam and Djibouti. We hope that other peoples that still seek their independence will shortly join us in the common endeavour to promote international peace and security.4.	The United Nations mirrors a concept of international relations based on mutual respect and co-operation amongStates. Although in some Articles of the Charter allowances were made for the realities of power  it is undeniable that the principle of equality among States is one of the fundamental pillars of the Charter. The co-operation which is sought is horizontal co-operation among sovereign States  in which there is no room for hegemony or subordination. The Charter of the United Nations as the supreme instrument of contemporary international law urges each of the States here represented to co-operate and to harmonize our interests in accordance with the parameters defined in its principles and purposes. Such co-operation naturally presupposes the seeking of a point of convergence which would be of benefit to all countries. To Brazil co-operation is a spontaneous gesture flowing from the ecumenical nature of its people. As Brazil understands and practises it  co-operation presupposes respect for national identities and for the sovereign right of States to seek the most adequate ways to reach the goals of welfare and progress of their peoples. It presupposes  therefore  respect for the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States which  more than a general principle of the United Nations  is a legal obligation assumed by all States upon signing and ratifying the Charter.5.	The factors which contribute most to the frustration of the first of the purposes of the Organization  namely that of guarding peace and avoiding the use of force in the settlement of international disputes  still exist. The reason is that among the areas of action of the United Nations  that of disarmament is perhaps the one in which the positive results have been fewest and on which the strengthening of international peace and security is most dependent.6.	In spite of that  Brazil continues to regard disarmament as one of the central endeavours of our time. New and redoubled international efforts in that direction must be made  for the meagre results hitherto obtained fall far short of the needs of the international community. The first of those needs  it cannot be repeated too often  is the very survival of human beings; and it is in the light of this  the greatest of all needs  that all others should be seen  such as the establishment of true conditions of international peace and security in order to benefit all peoples without distinction and to offer them tranquillity and the advantages of economic and technological progress.7.	The States which have the greatest potential ability to jeopardize our life on earth also have a correlated specific responsibility for facilitating the progressive attainment of understanding among all nations  with a view to the setting up of a more stable and equitable international political and economic order. The international acceptance of these values is not a simple matter of convenience but  in the world of today  a condition for survival. 8.	The inefficacy of multilateral efforts on disarmament and the paucity of results achieved up to now can only be a cause for disquiet. The ban on nuclear tests in three environments  besides being incomplete  has contributed little or nothing to the aims of disarmament or even to arms control. There is little confidence that international undertakings now in force will be sufficient to guarantee the use of outer space for exclusively peaceful ends. In relation to the seas and oceans  the only progress achieved relates to the ban on placing nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction on the sea-bed  on the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof. The Convention on bacteriological weapons was made possible only because the countries which do not possess such weapons in their armouries have made great concessions  including the relinquishment of a mechanism for verification and safeguards and the acceptance of a separate negotiation of a convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and on their destruction.9.	The arms race goes on. Strategic weapons are still being perfected and multiplied. The introduction of new generations of tactical nuclear armaments seems to be accompanied by the generalization of a tolerant attitude towards their possible use. By this course—and apart from the fact that the new weapons have an enormous potential for destruction—almost insensibly a new option is open for a possible nuclear escalation. Especially cruel weapons continue to be invented. These developments  as well as the dangerous experiments being made in genetic engineering  jeopardize the rights of all peoples and the integrity of the human person  both now and in the future.10.	We must not forget that it is in this context—in which negotiations among States coexist with the still inexorable pursuit of the arms race—that are rightly placed the efforts being made towards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  although these are not the only element in the problem. It does not seem to me necessary to repeat at this moment the criticism of the gaps and grave imperfections of those efforts  as mirrored in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This criticism was put forward by the signers of that Treaty themselves  during the Review Conference which took place in 1975.11.	In this regard  the Brazilian Government has recently had  in an official document with wide international distribution  the opportunity to state its position on the ensemble of questions related to the use of nuclear energy. The essence of our thinking bears repetition here.12.	Brazil is a peaceful county. The dominant concern of the Brazilian nation is its integrated  harmonious economic and social development. Brazil is opposed to all proliferation of nuclear weapons  whether vertical or horizontal  and is ready to participate in international efforts aimed at reducing and in due course eliminating nuclear arms  as well as preventing their proliferation. We believe that the true2	Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction.3	Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held at Geneva from 5 to 30 May 1975.meaning of non-proliferation is to ban the diffusion of nuclear weapons  not the dissemination of nuclear technology. Given adequate safeguards  access to the technology for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should not be subjected to discriminatory restrictions.13.	The Brazilian decision to implement an important nuclear programme for peaceful purposes was based on a careful evaluation of the energy needs of the country and the possible options for meeting such needs. Brazil is convinced that international co-operation  supported by appropriate safeguards  is the best means of ensuring the objectives of the development of the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without the risks of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The same directive  incidentally  was elaborated in the United Nations itself  for IAEA  whose long experience accumulated over the last two decades has proved so useful  was conceived and created precisely in order to attempt to accelerate and increase the contribution of nuclear energy to the peace  health and prosperity of the whole world  ensuring that such co-operation is not used in a way that would contribute to military ends.14.	We trust that the next special session of the General Assembly dedicated to disarmament will be a positive step in the multilateral negotiations concerning the problems in this field. Having in mind the preparatory work under way  we are especially confident that it will be possible to concentrate the attention of the General Assembly on the most critical of the areas of disarmament  namely  the negotiations for effective measures of nuclear disarmament.15.	Our community is annually called upon to pronounce itself on the Middle East  an area where advances and retreats occur on the road to peace. The Brazilian position has been reiterated in this plenary Assembly and in other bodies. True to the guiding principles of our nationality  we consider as indispensable elements for a just and lasting solution respect for the right of all States to their existence and for the right of all peoples and countries of this region to enjoy self-determination  to exercise their sovereignty and to live in peace. True  furthermore  to the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force  we share the widely manifested concern with regard to the recent initiatives that run counter to United Nations resolutions and that pretend to give a kind of de facto legitimacy to situations created by force. These initiatives make more difficult the establishment of peace in the region.16.	As a result of racial oppression and the persistence of colonialism  southern Africa is another region where serious tensions are widespread and put at risk the very maintenance of international peace and security. Brazil has repeatedly made plain its repudiation of racism and colonialism  together with its growing apprehension at this situation which is a challenge to the conscience of humanity. It was thus with special interest that we participated in the major meetings that took place this year in Maputo and in Lagos  namely  the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid.17.	The questions of interest to the peoples of southern Africa must be solved without further ado. The international community has the undeniable moral and political duty to create conditions to accelerate the solution of these international questions. In spite of the numerous obstacles raised by those who still benefit in the region from the present situation  the path to negotiation must be trod will perseverance. The options provided by the Charter of the United Nations should be utilized  among others  so as to make it perfectly clear that the international community is determined to see that the negotiations are conducted with speed.18.	Discrimination  segregation and racial hatred constitute one of the most extreme violations of the rights of the human person. The practices of apartheid deserve condemnation both at the ethical and juridical levels and at the political level  for  in addition to offending the moral conscience and transgressing human rights  they represent a factor that disturbs peace.19.	I should like also to mention  although very briefly  the geographical region to which we belong and with the aspirations of which Brazil fully identifies. It is with pleasure that I refer to the constructive relationship among the countries of Latin America developed on the basis of open friendship and positive co-operation aimed at mutual benefit.20.	Non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States and attachment to peaceful and effective means for the solution of occasional disputes  which stem very often from the very closeness of their relationship  constitute the incalculable heritage of the countries of that region.21.	Within the inter-American framework it is with satisfaction that I record a significant event  both for the countries in the hemisphere and for the international community  namely  the signing on 7 September of the treaties on the Panama Canal. This is an historic episode in which the search for convergence and an effort at cooperation prevailed. Panama and the United States of America have demonstrated a sense of opportunity and of realism in finding a mutually satisfactory solution of a question of long and painful duration. The treaties are an important step towards the re-establishment of justice and of the respect that all countries deserve  be they great or small  powerful or not powerful.22.	As I have pointed out  co-operation—which is urged upon us by the Charter of the United Nations—presupposes as a basic requirement respect for national identity and for the sovereignty of States. The Charter places the theme of human rights precisely within the field of international co-operation  and within that field makes the promotion of those rights one of the most important tasks of the Organization. The treatment of this question at the multilateral level might assist the creation of favourable conditions for the full exercise of those rights which  in our view  embrace not only civil and political aspects but also social1  and economic questions such as the right to food  to education  to culture  to work  to a life free from pauperism and to support in old age. All these matters must be dealt with within a broad and integrated perspective.23.	International concern over human rights is not new  and there is no novelty in the efforts of many States to see those rights respected. It would be useful to recall  even though briefly  the common conceptual heritage accumulated over the years in the consideration of this subject at the international level.24.	The first component of this heritage is the conviction that the problem is one of a fundamentally ethical nature  a basic fact that does not always seem to be present when the matter is being examined in this body or elsewhere. Very often the subject is dealt with intentions that differ from the sincere desire to protect the rights of man.25.	A second component of our common heritage lies in the conviction that the question of human rights is of a universal character. To justify discriminatory treatment on the basis of national interest is to destroy the very foundations of the defence of those rights.26.	Thirdly  it would be unrealistic to imagine that these question are  in practice  isolated from consideration of other problems which afflict the community of nations. The creation of conditions favourable to the generalized respect for human rights will depend on the substantial improvement of political and economic security at the international level. As long as the nuclear arms race continues unchecked and as long as no satisfaction is given within the framework of North-South relations to the just aspirations of the developing countries  the basic prerequisites will be missing to permit human rights  in their wider and truer meaning  being effectively respected on a global scale. The refusal to facilitate the establishment of a more just and more stable international economic order  one that would meet the claims of collective economic security for development  is a factor that cannot be ignored or overshadowed in the interest of respect for human rights.27.	Finally  the solution of the problems of the rights of man lies within the responsibility of the Government of each country. In a world which is still  unfortunately  marked by interventionist attitudes  be they open or veiled  and by the distortion of certain matters  no country or group of countries should enjoy the status of judge of other countries on such serious and intimate questions of national life.28.	Bearing in mind this conceptual heritage  Brazil has recently associated itself with the work of the Commission on Human Rights  an association which will allow it to contribute more effectively  at the normative international level  in the promotion of these rights. The machinery and procedures already available to the United Nations for the consideration of human rights problems seem to us ample and sufficient to enable the work to proceed at the rhythm required by the complexity of the subject and preserved from passing factors and circumstances.29.	International co-operation cannot and must not be an instrument to be resorted to for momentary convenience nor must it serve as the last resort for help in circumstances of acute crisis. It must be a continuous  constructive and creative effort An objective evaluation of the field of international economic relations demonstrates that such an effort is truly indispensable.32.	Initiatives and projects succeed one another without  as we should wish  any change occurring in the harsh realities facing the developing countries. Almost 20 years after the launching of the First United Nations Development Decade  almost 15 years after the convening of the first session of UNCTAD  and more than a generation after the creation of the Economic and Social Council where the central problems of world economic relations have been discussed  the developing countries still face severe obstacles and encounter structures and machinery which no longer respond to the claims of the present world.33.	Brazil was among the first to understand the threat to international security necessarily constituted by economic inequality. We were able to see in the international structures as they were then  and still are today  a grave restriction on the development process. In 1974  the Brazilian proposal on collective economic security for development proceeded from that finding to demonstrate that social justice and economic progress are essential to the system of guarantees among States and thus inseparable from the goal of peace and security.34.	The results arrived at after 18 months of work by the Conference on International Economic Co-operation cannot be described as encouraging. It had been expected that that Conference  even though it might have found it impossible to solve immediate problems  could have been the source of a new spirit which would prevail in the examination of sensitive and controversial questions when they were the subject of negotiations in specific forums. That did not come about  as demonstrated by the fruitless nature of the Paris negotiations. I do not wish now to begin the examination of the substance of the talks at the Conference  but I should like to recall that unfulfilled hopes and non-binding manifestations of goodwill are not substitutes for effective action.35.	If the weight of congealed structures and the immense obstacles raised by history in the face of those countries which arrived later to the process of industrialization is not enough  I must point out with special concern another aspect of the present picture of international economic relations: the re-emergence of protectionism in some developed countries. To overcome these additional difficulties  international co-operation is ever more necessary for the benefit of both the developing countries and the industrialized countries. Brazil expects developed countries to discourage discriminatory attitudes and to pledge themselves to give equitable treatment to exports from developing countries.36.	The recognition of the fact that difficulties do exist and the small margin of progress achieved do not dishearten us in our search for new ways. The developing countries must  above all  make use of their own efforts  of the growing weight of their economies and of their solidarity  which was tested under severe conditions  to continue pragmatically to act with strength  even within the present rules of the game  to overcome the difficulties and obstacles facing them.37.	But this  however  should not let us lose sight of the imperative need to continue to work  both at the operational and normative levels  to obtain structural changes in the intrinsically unjust nature of those rules.38.	It is  therefore  with a confidence tempered by realism that we identify the usefulness of two important coming conferences to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations: that on technical co-operation among developing countries and that on science and technology for development. I believe that few areas hold so much promise of beneficial results for the international community.39.	We have seen within the United Nations the expansion of the capacity of countries to express their national aspirations and to influence decision-making processes the consequences of which effect everyone We want to see this reality consolidated and strengthened. We want to see the complete abolition of the gap which still keeps many States at a distance from international consideration of questions affecting their interests. This is an urgent matter  for the accelerated technological development of some States may result in a new factor which will facilitate the survival of obsolete forms of international relations.40.	To allow the United Nations fully to discharge its great duties  it will be necessary to encourage the equitable participation of all States in the political process  thus reinvigorating the international system and giving new momentum to common efforts towards peace  security and development Brazil has confidence in the world of tomorrow.

"18",986,"BRB",32,1977,"﻿143.	Mr. President  the Barbados delegation wishes to offer you its congratulations on your election as President of the current session of this Assembly. Your election not only redounds to your personal credit  but it also indicates the high esteem in which your country is held. Your country's role over the last 20 years as a rational and mediating influence in world affairs has not gone unnoticed. The members of this Assembly confidently expect that the good sense that has traditionally been displayed by your country will be reflected in your judgement during this session.144.	My delegation also wishes to place on record its congratulations to Secretary-General Waldheim on his reappointment to his high office. His willingness to accept a second term of-office may be indicative of his courage  but our decision to re-elect him is clear evidence of the high regard in which he is held.145.	Once again  his admirable report on the work of the Organization has highlighted the main issues which have confronted the United Nations during"" the past year. Many of these issues have remained unresolved for far too long. Few of them are new. Some of them have reappeared in a new guise. Each of them is crucial for the maintenance of international peace and good order. The most striking of them is the continued failure of the nations of the world to grapple with the challenge of achieving a just economic order and an equitable distribution of the world's resources among all its peoples.146.	The main concern of the poor peoples of the developing countries still remains the stark failure of the world community to answer our urgent problems of disease  food  shelter  water  education and health-in short  our basic human needs. This Assembly's primary duty is still to promote higher living standards  full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development.147.	My Government therefore shares the disappointment and anxiety reflected in the Secretary-General's comments on the lack of real progress towards achieving a new international economic order. The recent Conference on International Economic Co-operation has done precious little towards effecting real structural change  improving the rate of recovery of the world economy or solving the problems of high unemployment  inflation and balance-of- payments deficits which continue to plague our nations  especially the developing non-oil-producing States.148.	For the millions who live in the small developing and relatively resourceless countries  action requires international economic co-operation. Strongly committed though we are to the principles of self-reliance  we cannot simply raise ourselves by our own bootstraps  for a programme of self-reliance can only achieve optimum results if external factors that inhibit internal development are eliminated. For this reason  Barbados  like other developing countries of the world  will continue to place its hope in the movement for concerted international economic co-operation and the establishment of a new international economic order.149.	My Government wishes to commend to this Assembly the solutions recommended in the Mclntyre report entitled ""Towards a new international economic order""  prepared by the Commonwealth Group of Experts and made a document of this Organization. This report examines the discomforting facts about the harshly unequal conditions of life in developed and developing countries. It notes the failure of the developing countries as a whole to meet even the basic needs of much of their population and observes  among other things  that if the present trends continue the balance-of-payments situation of the developing countries will become disastrously unmanageable.150.	The solution of these problems does not lie in the declining sense of urgency and concomitant dash for protectionist policies being adopted by the industrialized developed countries. Instead  there is an urgent need for a new approach to commodity arrangements so as to provide price stability for producers of primary products. The early establishment of a common fund of some $6 billion  as proposed by UNCTAD  is imperative. Measures must be taken to expand the International Fund for Agricultural Development to accelerate agricultural and rural development  and there must also be a concerted effort for industrial development and co-operation between the industrialized and non-industrialized countries.151.	The issue of energy  which was a dominant issue at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  is crucial to the restructuring of the economies of developing countries and of the world economic order. The Government of Barbados is aware that the world’s non-renewable resources of oil and gas ""are being rapidly depleted because of the world-wide energy demand. The interests of all peoples of developing countries demand that we exploit  expand and diversify our indigenous and non-conventional sources of energy. Programmes for the transfer of appropriate technology-especially related to the search for alternative sources of energy—must be initiated without delay. This United Nations and its specialized agencies have a crucial role to play in devising such programmes  which will guarantee the flow of resources for investment purposes from developed to developing countries on a massive scale and enable oil-deficient developing countries to develop new energy supplies.152.	One of the direct results of acute energy situation in the world is the massive increase of indebtedness of developing countries. Those countries continue to be hampered in their efforts to develop their economies by having to service large debts borrowed on the international capital markets. The existence of this chronic indebtedness is symptomatic of the fact that something is fundamentally wrong with the entire structure of the world economy and the international trade system-153.	Regrettably  no significant progress has been made towards framing a comprehensive programme to assist developing countries in overcoming the crushing burden of debt which is an effective barrier to the implementation of development programmes.154.	The seventh special session of the United Nations in1975 	agreed that the level of official development assistance  should produce a net transfer of such assistance equal to 0.7 per cent of gross national product. Between 1965 and 1975 disbursements on official development assistance from the developed market-economy countries to developing countries and multilateral organizations  net of amortization  increased negligibly  from $11.3 billion to $13.6 billion at constant 1975 prices. Between 1975 and1976 	the increase has been equally negligible  and may  in net terms  even amount to a decrease.155.	If there is to be any serious dent in the problem of world borrowing  then assistance should be granted on concessionary terms without the attachment of difficult conditions which at present militate against the fulfilment of development targets.156.	The record of developed countries in providing concessionary assistance has been deplorable. While the developed countries are committed to reaching an official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product  in fact  only two of the industrialized countries have reached this target  and not many others seem to have the political will to do so. Yet the gross national product of the industrialized countries has been rising  while their net disbursement of aid has stagnated.157.	Missing the target  in this regard  knows no ideology. The record clearly indicates that both the United States of America  almost all of the other industrialized free market countries  the Soviet Union and the other centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe-all of which often claim to be most concerned about the welfare of the developing countries  and are equally solicitous for our support—have treated the world's poor most shabbily. The United States of America has transferred less than 0.3 per cent of its gross national product and the Soviet Union less than 0.1 per cent.158.	The record of the members of OPEC is  on the whole  also a cause of concern. Not only is their concessional aid highly concentrated in a handful of countries  mainly Arab and Islamic  but huge portions of the oil-based surpluses which they accumulate are allowed to be siphoned off by developed countries  at no benefit whatsoever to the developing countries.159.	This parsimonious attitude towards developmental concessionary aid has also had a deleterious impact on the effectiveness of this Organization's development programme. It has adversely affected UNDP  a body which is still to be congratulated for the constructive work it is doing in channelling technical assistance to developing countries. UNDP must be given adequate means to continue its extremely important work.160.	In this regard  the factors which are considered to be of greatest significance in indicative-planning-figure allocations must be reviewed. While the Government of Barbados agrees in principle that the granting of technical assistance should discriminate in favour of the least developed countries  we also hold the view that this principle should be applied without jeopardizing the development of countries which are classified as being in the mid-range  because of their per capita gross national product. UNDP could be of even greater assistance to our development if  in applying criteria for determining indicative-planning-figure allocations  greater significance was placed on factors such as the narrowness of our industrial base and the virtual absence of natural resources which would permit rapid industrialization.161.	My country's Government would wish this session to direct specific and more urgent attention to the special characteristics of the small island economies—countries of limited markets. The erroneous belief exists that small island countries receive reasonably generous amounts of official development assistance. It is further incorrectly argued that  since they are not among the world's poorest  it would be difficult to make a general case for an increase in their share of world aid.162.	I submit that this represents the misuse of crude aggregates for the determination of eligibility for assistance. The extent of the spurious generosity is measured in per capita terms-a criterion of more than doubtful validity for a country like Barbados. A single loan to a single sector for a specific project could not suddenly catapult a small economy like Barbados with a population of 250 000 into that category of developing countries best equipped to sustain improved living standards without external assistance. But crude per capita criteria would have us believe so. The sweeping uncritical use of per capita aid flows as a measure of the needs of a country for continued external assistance guarantees the perpetuation of an inadequate appreciation of need  in the face of dismally unsatisfactory levels of assistance.163.	My delegation suggests that the aid community rid itself of the simplistic notion that all the social and economic complexities of small economies can be compressed in a per capita measurement of gross national product. My delegation further maintains that a country's capacity to sustain an acceptable or agreed rate of economic advance should be the true measure of its need.164.	This Assembly's attention has previously been drawn to the urgent need for an action programme in favour of developing island economies. Resolution 31/156  which recommends such a programme  is in accordance with the decisions taken at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi which recognized that particular attention should be devoted to such countries. I wish  however  to express my country's disappointment at the rate of progress in implementing the terms of that resolution. Strong and urgent action is called for.165.	My Government considers that the rapid economic development of the less-privileged countries continues to be recklessly delayed by the wanton spending on arms by the developed countries. The record shows that in the last 15 years nations have spent almost $400 billion annually on arms—a shameful waste that is a savage indictment of man's claim to civilization. This conduct highlights the monumental contradiction which the world faces. ""Squander- mania"" on munitions is practised with reckless abandon as the entreaties of the poor for a new international economic order are met with high-sounding platitudes.166.	Seven years ago this Assembly directed the attention of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the comprehensive programme of disarmament. Most of this has not been implemented. Worse still  this Assembly  having recognized the gravity of the arms situation  endorsed the joint statement of agreed principles for disarmament negotiations—action which was undertaken by the Soviet Union and by the United States. Yet this has not been implemented.167.	Barbados welcomes the decision that a special session of the United Nations be devoted to disarmament in 1978. Barbados strongly supports the adoption of a declaration on disarmament which would embody the following basic principles.168.	First  disarmament is the concern and responsibility of all mankind and not an esoteric problem for a few militarily powerful countries.169.	Secondly  disarmament is possible only within the framework of universal confidence and mutual trust. Hence the Government of Barbados believes that an international system of security is a necessary pre-condition for complete disarmament.170.	Thirdly  a corollary of the need to foster confidence is the development of machinery which would permit a reduction of arms and armed forces to take place without any unfair advantage accruing to any nation.171.	Fourthly  the political will to achieve disarmament will not spring into existence ex nihilo but must be generated by a mass campaign designed to inform the peoples of the world of the perils that threaten them.172.	Principles are lifeless  however  unless they are applied to real problems  and for this reason Barbados strongly advocates the adoption of a programme of action as the instrument to animate the principles adumbrated in the declaration on disarmament. The limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons and delivery systems are central to a programme of disarmament. Barbados is therefore in agreement with the holding of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the European meetings on mutual force reductions.173.	Barbados is resolutely and unalterably opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons  and is firmly of the opinion that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be adhered to by all the nations of the world. A firm commitment and strict observance would  in the view of this delegation  go a long way towards ensuring that the Caribbean  among other regions  remains a zone of peace.174.	In southern Africa there can be found arms merchants plying their military hardware to assist in shoring up decaying colonialist regimes. Barbados was first intimately exposed many years ago-perhaps as many as 30-to the brutality which has so often typified the attitude of the authorities towards black people in southern Africa when one of our nationals suffered death as a result of beatings at the hands of the so-called representatives of law and order. From this stark experience all Barbadians have grown to detest and abhor the doctrine and practice of apartheid  and it is against this background that our policies towards southern Africa have been shaped.175.	Barbados hails the courageous struggle being waged by African nationalist freedom fighters  whose actions on the field of battle have been so effective that reluctant Western Powers have been forced at long last to look for solutions to a problem to which they have contributed in no small measure. Once again my country wishes to pay a tribute to those whose lives have been cut short because they sought their freedom from shameful tyranny. Neither we nor history will forget them.176.	Barbados welcomes the Anglo-American proposals as constituting a basis for agreement on a settlement which provides for majority rule without delay and for the full independence of Zimbabwe in 1978. While welcoming the push for peace  Barbados cannot accept peace at any price. The arrangement of a cease fire must not emasculate the Patriotic Front. We applaud the front-line States for their reasonable but firm approach to the Zimbabwe freedom struggle  and will continue to support steps taken to assist them in bearing the heavy burden which they must carry until Zimbabwe is free.177.	Just as last year in this Assembly Barbados urged that there be no sham independence for the Transkei  so today Barbados urges that there be no sham independence for Zimbabwe and no sham independence for a truncated Namibia. The South African policy on Namibia  including the attempt to cling to Walvis Bay  represents a wicked attempt to control without governing  to extend the ""bantustan"" policy in all but name.178.	During the past year the waters in southern Africa have been troubled Nowhere has this been more so than in Soweto  where youths and schoolchildren have been cut down by the agents of bitter tyranny. Since the Soweto riots of last year murders and detentions have increased; the latest martyr to fall before the diabolical killers that govern South Africa is Steven Biko  a leader of the ""black consciousness"" movement of that country. But the white rulers of South Africa and their supporters are not the only guilty persons in this sordid chapter of human history. They have allies in many of the capitals of the world. Their allies are persons who pose as respectable  law-abiding citizens while they give economic support through trans- nationals corporations to that violent regime.179.	Barbados calls upon all those countries whose transnational corporations operate in South Africa to introduce regulations without delay to put an end to this immoral economic intercourse. The Government of Barbados believes that South Africa should be totally isolated through economic sanctions  including an oil embargo and a mandatory arms embargo.180.	In conducting a relentless struggle against the system of apartheid Barbados welcomed the holding of the World Conference for Action Against Apartheid in Lagos and believes that it moved the world a step further along the road to dismantling that inhuman social system.181.	Much as my Government despises the blatant disregard of human rights in southern Africa  it cannot turn a blind eye to disrespect for human rights elsewhere  whether in central or northern Africa  in eastern or western Europe  in northern  central or southern America  in the Caribbean or elsewhere in the world. For us in Barbados two wrongs do not make a right.182.	While Barbados does not subscribe to the view that the question of human rights should be hypocritically or mischievously used as a propaganda tool  it cannot regard as a breach of the principle of non-intervention all comments on and condemnation of violations of civil  political or other rights in places beyond one's own boundaries. Barbados recognizes that the matter of human rights is one of great complexity and delicacy  reflecting as it does the diversity of traditions  codes of behaviour  practices and priorities in different countries and different parts of the world. Nevertheless there are certain violations which must be denounced. It would be unprincipled to overlook these.183.	Barbadian policy has traditionally been motivated by profound humanistic impulses  and Barbados has consequently pressed for and supported instruments that express concern for and protect human rights  such as the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  together with its Optional Protocol. Barbados would like to see all the nations of the world ratify and implement in good faith the terms of these important instruments.184.	On the question of civil and political rights  the Government of Barbados remains unreservedly and without qualification committed to freedom of speech  freedom from victimization on account of political or religious belief  freedom from discrimination on grounds of class  sex or race  the right to a free and open press  the right freely to choose one's leaders  and respect for human dignity  which prohibits acts of unlawful detention or torture.185.	In the field of economic rights  the Government of Barbados is committed to a programme of social justice and accordingly subscribes to the proposition that the people of every country are entitled to have their basic needs satisfied-including the right to work  the right to proper health services  the right to adequate food  and the right to proper housing and to maximum opportunities for education.186.	Barbados wishes to welcome the nations of Djibouti and Viet Nam to this Organization. Both have made their way to independence through difficulties  but my delegation is confident that those two vastly dissimilar States have the capacity to add their own distinctive element to the mosaic that is the United Nations.187.	While welcoming Djibouti and Viet Nam  Barbados wishes to direct the attention of this Organization to the continued and enforced absence of the Central American territory of Belize. Belize is kept out of this Organization and denied access to its privileges  not because of any short-coming or failing on its part  not because of the conduct of an intransigent colonizer  but because of the obduracy of a belligerent neighbour  Guatemala  whose overt and continued belligerence flies in the face of this Organization's sacred principle of universality and of that of self-determination enshrined in United Nations General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. What makes the effrontery of Belize's neighbour more galling is that States which Barbados thinks should really know better  and which are themselves seeking new freedoms  either supply the openly bellicose Guatemala with arms and encourage it with words  or  like some of our so-called friends  remain strangely silent. It is criminal hypocrisy for nations to utter pieties about the right of all peoples to live in security and at the same time surreptitiously to provide weapons to aggressive countries for the purpose of extinguishing that same right. Barbados calls upon all those countries which supply Guatemala with arms to desist from supporting it in its evil intention of invading Belize.188.	Barbados is a small peace-loving  law-abiding Caribbean nation which seeks no quarrel with any country. The people of my country have in the past lived peaceably with all men and we intend to continue to do so. It is our wish that the Caribbean remain free from war and the threat of war. We have no military resources to enforce peace within the region  but in respect of Belize we call upon those who have the power or influence to disturb the tranquillity of the Caribbean to desist from so doing. The Government of Barbados wishes to express its approval of the emphatic response of the United Kingdom to the military threat to Belize last June  and it is heartened by the demonstration of will on the part of the United Kingdom to discharge its obligations as the administering Power of Belize.189.	Barbados looks forward to welcoming a free Belize to this Organization in the near future and urges all nations to assist in enabling Belize to take its rightful place in this Assembly.190.	During the past years the cancer of international terrorism has continued to afflict the entire body of nations  bedevilling the security of the world and causing the death of innocent persons.191.	At the. thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly the Prime Minister of Barbados  the Right Honourable J. M. G. M. Adams  declared an unswerving commitment on the part of the Government of Barbados to the removal of the scourge of terrorism from the face of the earth. The will and resolve of Barbados to work towards this end remain as firm as ever.192.	Acts of terrorism have international ramifications and  particularly when they are executed in a random and senseless fashion  a single country finds it extremely difficult to deal with the menace. Barbados belie s it is imperative that instruments be drawn up which would attempt to distinguish nakedly criminal acts from genuine struggles for liberation. Barbados also wishes to reiterate its support for the principles enshrined in the Conventions of Montreal and Tokyo and would urge all nations at the earliest opportunity to support the adoption of a convention against the taking of hostages.193.	Barbados  as a small island standing out in the Atlantic  has a natural interest in the proceedings of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The collapse of that Conference at this stage would be particularly detrimental to island communities such as ours  which would be placed at the tender mercies of wealthy predators.194.	Barbados hopes that at the seventh session of the Conference  planned for Geneva in 1978  the countries of the world will demonstrate that  whatever its shortcomings  as a negotiating forum the United Nations is as useful an instrument as we can invent at this stage of mankind's development.195.	Barbados will continue to give its full support to the United Nations  confident in the knowledge that it is an institution whose importance for small States cannot be exaggerated. For small States  this Organization goes some way towards precluding the operation of the law of the jungle and of the more savage inclinations of States. In the past Barbados has always resisted attempts to belittle or disregard the role of the United Nations  and we will continue to cling to the belief that our role is to strengthen this institution and to enable it to accomplish the task with which it is charged by its Charter. At the same time Barbados wishes to reaffirm the right of all States to participate in United Nations activities as sovereign equals and to reaffirm the principle of universality which guarantees the right of all States to be Members of this world body.196.	My delegation comes to this session bringing not might but reason  realizing that wisdom is not related to size  nor vision to power. Barbados will aim to speak out frankly where necessary  but without rancour or malice. Our aim will be to defend principles and to promote policies for their implementation. Barbados will therefore support all efforts designed to advance the economic development of all peoples of all nations  especially those of the poorest nations  holding the view that  since the world's technology has given us the tools to do the job  it would be tragic to fail. Barbados will aim to introduce into the debates of this Assembly a concern for morality and justice in international relationships. Our traditions and best instincts dictate this role to us  and we shall play it without fear or favour.197.	The issues which this Assembly faces are daunting  but to despair would be disastrous. The lives and well-being of this world's millions hang on our decisions. We must not allow our jargon  our euphemisms  our rhetoric and our resolutions to conceal the fact that behind all our words and documents lie food  houses  schools  jobs  disease—even wars  if we fail. This places on us all a very solemn responsibility. For the sake of all the peoples of this world  whether in deserts or on the seas  in villages or in cities  we must continue to work towards the fulfilment of their basic needs.198.	This session must not falter. Let not difficulty blunt our resolve  or experience dim our hope. "
"19",1062,"BTN",32,1977,"﻿187.	 Mr. President  I have the honour of conveying to you  and through you to the representatives gathered here  the greetings of my sovereign  His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  and of expressing His Majesty's best wishes and hopes that  under your stewardship  the thirty-second session of the General Assembly will deal courageously with the urgent questions confronting the world community.188.	It is also my privilege  on behalf of the Kingdom of Bhutan  to congratulate you most warmly on your election as President of this session of the Assembly. Your long and eminent service both in the field of international diplomacy and in important positions in your own Government assures us that you will provide wise and able leadership. It is a matter of joy for us that this year  like last year  a fellow-member of the non-aligned movement holds this important post.189.	To your predecessor. Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  I should like to express our deep appreciation for the efficient manner in which he guided our deliberations during the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.190.	As the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  enters his second term of office  we should also like to add our appreciation for his tireless efforts in the service of peace and international understanding and for the dedication  alertness  far-sightedness and tact which he has brought to the important task entrusted to him191.	Each year Heads of State  Heads of Government and their representatives from many different regions meet in this great -Assembly to review the international situation and to promote peace and security for the world's nations and their peoples. We are gratified that  through their efforts  the world has so far been spared another global war. At the same time  however  we are aware that many good and well-intentioned efforts to fulfil the peace-keeping responsibilities laid down by the United Nations Charter have been frustrated. The machinery of collective security is often obstructed and decisions are usually delayed. When decisions are taken  obstacles frequently stand in the way of their implementation. In the light of this  the United Nations presents a picture of uncertainty and institutional impasse which often overshadows its many significant achievements.192.	We believe  therefore  that one of the most important concerns of this Assembly should be the strengthening of the United Nations as a peace-making body. The General Assembly and the Security Council are vital instruments in the quest for world peace today. As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report at the beginning of this session  misuse of the Security Council or lack of respect for its decisions ""may bring us to a time when the Council is desperately needed and will be found to be too weak to fulfil its responsibilities"" We believe that the strengthening of this body and the implementation of its decisions should receive our utmost attention.193.	One of the most crucial objectives on the international scene continues to be the relaxation of tensions between the two major Power blocs and  in particular  between the two super-Powers themselves. The developing countries have always maintained that  if efforts to bring about this relaxation are to be effective  they must be more broadly based. Any situation which perpetuates rivalry for spheres of influence  condones the results of colonialism or leaves the way open for interference in the internal affairs of States has been consistently rejected by members of the non-aligned movement. The Political Declaration of the movement's Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met in Sri Lanka last year  takes this point categorically. Acceptance of any situation which endorses the existing balance of power and the threat of domination of smaller nations by those more powerful would shatter the sovereign equality that is the very basis of the United Nations.194.	It is for this reason that the non-aligned movement has become such a valuable and credible force for peaceful coexistence. Non-alignment enables a State to join with like-minded nations which face economic and political odds similar to its own  while at the same time preserving its freedom of action on the international scene.195.	During the 32-year-life of the United Nations  substantial progress has been made towards decolonization  which is an essential prerequisite for the emergence of a new and just international order. The United Nations is now close to achieving universality of membership. The Kingdom of Bhutan attaches great importance to this principle of universality. We believe that all sovereign  independent nations have a right to join this family of nations. Last year we had much pleasure in welcoming the Seychelles  Angola and Western Samoa to this great Organization. This year we congratulate the Republic of Djibouti on its accession to independence and welcome it with equally great pleasure to the United Nations.196.	We warmly welcome also the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  a fellow member of the non-aligned movement. Viet Nam and its people have undergone tragic losses and suffering  and our good wishes are with them in their efforts to rebuild their great country. We are confident that the representatives of Viet Nam will make valuable and constructive contributions to the fulfilment of the goals and ideals enshrined in the Charter  and we look forward to working with them here at the United Nations.197.	Although much has been achieved in decolonization  remnants of colonialism still exist in different parts of the world. Nowhere is this situation more shamefully apparent than in southern Africa. Here oppression  colonialism and racial discrimination are being practised unabatedly. It was with profound shock and sorrow that we learned last month of the untimely death of Steven Biko. That a young black leader of Steven Biko's stature and promise should die in this tragic and questionable way is a further indictment of the unconscionable apartheid policy of the Pretoria regime. The practices of both this Government and of the illegal white minority regime in Zimbabwe contravene all the principles of justice and human rights. His Majesty the King  at the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries last year  said:""The inhuman practice of apartheid  which has been condemned by the international community times without number and which no civilized person can support  continues to be practised. The peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia continue to be denied their just and legitimate right to self-determination and independence. We are firmly of the view that concerted and joint action should be taken to bring about a speedy implementation of the relevant  resolutions and decisions of the Security Council  the General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity.""198.	My Government's policy on this urgent question remains unchanged. We believe that the majority of the people  and they alone  must be allowed to shape their own destiny. Unless the minority regimes are prepared to change  and change fast  to accept immediately the inevitability of majority rule  they will be the architects of their own destruction. We believe the great Powers have a special responsibility in this area. It is in view of this that we welcome the recent Security Council resolution 415(1977)  which authorizes the Secretary-General to appoint a representative to enter into discussions with all the parties concerning the military and associated arrangements that are considered necessary to effect the transition to majority rule in southern Rhodesia. The will of the international community has already been clearly demonstrated during the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo  Mozambique. We endorse the Maputo Declaration in support of the oppressed peoples in the area  and the Programme of Action for the Liberation of Zimbabwe and Namibia.199.	The continuing delay by the international community in coming to grips with long-standing major problems increases the likelihood of new tensions and problems arising in these areas. The situation in the Middle East is one of these long-standing major problems. As .we stated in this forum in 1975 8 and again in 1976  we are firmly convinced that any negotiations aimed at a just and durable peace in the Middle East must be based on the right of the Palestinians to return to their homeland and-  establish an independent State  and of all States in the area  including Israel  to exist within universally recognized boundaries. In this context  we welcome the Soviet-American statement of 1 October on the principles and objectives of a new Middle East peace conference in Geneva as a positive step forward in the search for a just and permanent peace in the region.200.	The other area of our concern is Cyprus. Unhappily  present developments and past efforts have brought us no closer to a peaceful solution of the conflict besetting this island. It is hoped that a formula can be found which makes it possible for the island's two communities to live in harmony  and to preserve the integrity of Cyprus as a single State. The principles enunciated in General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX)  and the subsequent Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  in our opinion  still provide a valid framework for a just settlement. We would like to express the hope that the lifelong efforts and sacrifices made by the great son of Cyprus  Archbishop Makarios  for the independence  unity and integrity of his beloved country will not have been in vain.201.	I wish to stress that it is a cause of particular concern to my Government  as it is to those of the other littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  that the potential for great-Power conflict in this ocean still exists. Six years ago the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. This declaration has not been honoured by the great Powers. It is our earnest hope that these Powers will co-operate with the littoral and hinterland States to implement resolution 2832 (XXVI) in the near future  and to remove the foreign military presence  including bases  from this sensitive area.202.	Some of the problems of maintaining international peace and security are intractably buried in the ongoing negotiations on disarmament. To our regret  there has been no substantial progress in these negotiations. We completely endorse the Secretary-General's statement  in his report to the Assembly  that ""the developing countries ... must be involved  and actively so  in a problem which vitally affects them all"". In this spirit  we welcome the decision taken by the last General Assembly  at the initiative of the Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries  to convene a special session on disarmament next year. Success in this critical area  long overdue  would bring far-reaching benefits  not only in relaxing tensions but also in releasing much-needed resources for development purposes.203.	In an address to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  the Secretary-General pointed to an accumulation of arms far beyond the needs of legitimate defence which not only endangers world security but now annually absorbs some $350 billion  at a time when the struggle to alleviate the hunger  poverty and disease that plague many hundreds of millions of the world's people suffers from lack of resources.204.	The sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly have made us realize more than ever that we live in an interdependent world and that the old order must give way to a new one. It is unacceptable for the process of interdependence to continue indefinitely to accentuate the expansion of only the great industrialized nations. At present almost all the world's technological capacity and resources are concentrated in a few countries  while at the same time two thirds of humanity live in poverty  a great many of them below the subsistence level.205.	There is an urgent need to bring fresh thinking and an enlightened and positive approach to these vast and disturbing inequalities. We must in particular  see that the benefits of scientific and technological development are used for the good of all and not just of a privileged few. The world's scientific community must bear in mind the principle of a new international order under which prevailing economic  social  cultural and scientific conditions will be restructured. The paths towards this new order have been paved by the sixth and seventh special sessions and by the Manila Declaration of the Group of 77  which led to the adoption of UNCTAD resolution 98(IV).n Through the Integrated Programme laid down in UNCTAD resolution 93 (IV) the inequities of the past will be replaced by international co-operation based on the concept of collective self-reliance.206.	Many of the problems the world faces today stem from the imbalances and inequalities inherent in the world economic order. At present the products of all the world's labour contribute to consumption and material accumulation in only a small number of the world's countries. The gap between the rich and the poor nations has continued to grow. Today it is sadly true that most of the world's population have little to expect from life and are excluded from the material and spiritual benefits necessary for human dignity. This is particularly true of the least developed countries. The extremely difficult economic conditions under which the poorest countries labour are the result not just of disabilities arising from their geographic location but also—in fact  largely-of man-made impediments to growth.207.	If it is to provide a decent and dignified life for all its peoples  the world has to undergo immense transformation. We believe it is the mission of the United Nations to shape and contribute to this new order  for upon it rests the maintenance of peace and security  which is the very purpose of this Organization.208.	Another urgent issue which faces the international community is the equitable distribution of the vast wealth of the sea. Almost a decade has passed since the adoption of United Nations resolution 2749 (XXV)  which declared the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the resources of the area as the common heritage of mankind. As many as six sessions have been devoted to formulating an international law governing the uses of the sea. Yet we are nowhere near concluding an acceptable convention. The conflicting claims and views that still exist indicate the dimensions of the complex task ahead of us in what the Secretary-General has so rightly called ""one of the most important and far-reaching endeavours ever embarked on by the international community"" 209.	The time has come to put an end to the interminable quibbling over technicalities and to demonstrate statesmanlike wisdom in completing this long and arduous task. The informal composite negotiating text that has been brought out should be used to fullest advantage. All Member States  whether land-locked or coastal  must endeavour to harmonize their views and interests as rapidly as possible.210.	The right of free access to and from the sea and freedom of transit facilities are vital to all land-locked countries  and Bhutan is no exception. The position of a land-locked country  especially a developing one  is one of serious disadvantage in the modern world'. Fortunately  we have been receiving the genuine understanding and generous co-operation of our coastal neighbour  India not only in expanding our trade but in modernizing our economy.211.	Bhutan belongs to the South Asian subcontinent. In that area  despite many changes in the recent past  the prospects for peace and stability are particularly good. The present trend towards the abatement of tension in the region offers  we believe  an opportunity for the countries to develop and become more self-reliant. With many of those countries  and especially with our immediate neighbour  India  Bhutan shares an ancient cultural heritage and a long  varied history. Today we share also a common purpose in building our nations in the long-term interests of our peoples.212.	The Kingdom of Bhutan places special emphasis upon good neighbourliness based on concord  trust and co-operation. It is our constant endeavour to promote peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with countries both near and far  relations based on mutual respect for national sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs. We are firmly committed to the fundamental principles of the United Nations and reaffirm our support for the ideals of justice and peace. Under the inspiring leadership of our wise and dynamic monarch we are wholly committed to the orderly and uninterrupted economic development of our country and to the attainment of our national goal of economic self-reliance.213.	The issues we will debate at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly do not admit of easy solutions. Many of .them are long-standing and complex. Some give rise to fierce and intemperate passions. A number have been under debate here for more years than most of us care to remember. But whatever disagreements we may have on their substance  there is one thing on which no disagreement is possible: solutions must be found to them all  and in the shortest possible time  if the peace of our planet is not to be gravely endangered. The responsibilities and duties of the Member States to the United Nations emanate from their commitment  freely and spontaneously undertaken  to the Charter of this great Organization. It is a commitment which does not admit of exceptions and reservations. Let us prove to the world that the United Nations is fully aware of its responsibilities and that it is determined to live up to them."
"20",1102,"BWA",32,1977,"﻿149.	Late in the day  Mr. President  allow me to add the voice of the Republic of Botswana to those of many others who have already congratulated you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. May I also express my congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his work in the past year. Of him I am qualified to cite living examples of distinguished and objective performance  not only by his person but also by those who work with him. Time and modesty prevail over passion and sentiment  and suffice it therefore for me to congratulate you both  together with your officers and to the same degree the officers who distinguished themselves in looking after our affairs in the past year.150.	Botswana's adherence to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter remains firm and unequivocal. The United Nations  despite its limitations  continues to play a vital role in the quest for international peace and security. We note with satisfaction the significant and growing contribution of the non-aligned countries and others to the evolution of the United Nations as an instrument for bringing about a new international economic and social order.151.	We are conscious of the fact that the United Nations has not always moved with the desired speed and effectiveness to settle crises which threaten world peace. This situation arises because it is often too difficult to strike the correct and workable balance between the sovereign rights and interests of Member States and the principles and purposes of the Charter. It is clear  therefore  that the effectiveness of the world body and the enhancement of its role will depend not only upon the restructuring of the Organization  important though this is  but ultimately upon the respect it enjoys in the eyes of the individual States Members  and their readiness to comply with its resolutions and implement its decisions 152.	Equally important is the fact that if the United Nations is truly to serve man everywhere then it must aspire to universal membership. This goal has sometimes been made more difficult to attain because of the abuse of the veto. The Republics of Angola and Viet Nam were for some time denied their rightful place in this body in that manner. We therefore implore those who wield the veto to refrain from using it to serve narrow political interests and to use it only if it is in the interest of the world community as a whole.153.	We are happy to welcome to this family of nations the Republics of Djibouti and Viet Nam. We are confident that the new Members will make a significant contribution to the ideals and objectives of the Charter of our Organization.154.	During the thirty-first session the General Assembly adopted resolution 31/178  which reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to the establishment of a new and more just world economic order. Furthermore  the General Assembly also decided that it would undertake during the course of this session a review of progress made to date towards building a new international economic order.155.	The biggest achievement over the past several years of multiple  lengthy and often contentious meetings has been the virtually universal acceptance of three reciprocal principles  namely  first  that existing world arrangements for production  trade and finance have not brought and are not likely to bring about a world in which men and nations can make themselves self-supporting; secondly  that  although it is unlikely that the distribution of resources will be equalized and the gap closed between those who have more and those who have less  there will be no justice and little peace until all men and nations have the opportunity to make themselves self-supporting; and thirdly  that therefore the old order must change and a new one be created and tried.156.	The fact that there will be shifts in what is produced  how it is produced  where it is produced and who produces it is accepted  and all nations now agree  albeit some reluctantly  to sit down to discuss not whether but how to change the old order and build the new. That consensus is no mean accomplishment and is one for which the developing countries may rightly take most of the credit. It has been their initiative  articulateness and persistence  often in the teeth of very strong opposition  that has brought this recognition among the developed nations that the present arrangements will not do and that reform must replace modification.157.	Of course  we in the developing world are impatient to translate principles into practice now  immediately  to evolve new organizations and arrangements and get on with what perhaps euphemistically is called structural transformation. Our constituents have waited too long and they are hungry  and we know that  as the song goes  a hungry man is an angry man"". Yet the developed countries seem wary about giving up the old arrangements  however inequitable  for ones not yet defined. They may fear unemployment  shortages and higher prices for their constituents  while these prevail in the fragile economies of the developing world. Our impatience  and their impatience with our impatience  will no doubt continue until men and nations can become self-supporting.158.	The establishment of principles as agreed on at the seventh special session  or of targets as set out in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action  should create no hiatus. For Botswana it is a matter of serious concern and disappointment that the spirit of consensus which characterized the seventh special session is being dissipated as some nations appear not only to delay but to backslide. Targets we have  but the process of constructing strategies which move us towards those goals should be hastened. Our impatience should not be mistaken for lack of realism  however. We are pragmatic enough to appreciate that transformation does not connote some sudden total turnabout and that turning vision into reality is a building process. Let me concede that  although there has been no dramatic transformation  we are beginning to see the emergence of multiple interests which go beyond the simple counterpoise of the developed as against the developing. Multiple roles will have to be identified even among international institutions  developed market economies  centrally-planned economies and developing countries. Bringing this about will require from us all creation  compromise  co-operation and confrontation. We shall miss our objective if we stand off. If we succeed  the benefits will enhance the existence of us all.159.	I must temper my inspiration with a return to our traditional impatience as I look briefly over some of the recent past and forthcoming efforts to chart the new course.160.	The news about the outcome of the North-South dialogue in Paris is too recent to require any elaboration on my part. We have noted with regret that little agreement on substantive matters was reached. My delegation is heartened however by the agreement in principle on the establishment of a common fund the purposes and objectives of which are to be the subject of negotiation at the session of UNCTAD in November. The acceptance by the developed countries of the idea of a common fund is a welcome gesture. However  such sporadic gestures are not in themselves enough to redress the perilous position of the developing countries or appease our determination to secure basic changes.161.	We welcome the intention to resume next month the negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the common fund. We urge all the parties concerned to work towards sufficient agreement on the principles so that more detailed work to elaborate the programme may commence without delay. In this connexion my delegation hopes that the active interest in the scheme being shown by other groupings of States such as the Commonwealth augurs well for the success of the meeting.162.	Botswana 'egrets the fact that one again there has been very little movement in the multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva towards an expansion of trade which brings significant benefits to countries of the third world. We hope that this Assembly will urge the participating countries to work towards a very early conclusion of those negotiations.163.	Allow me to make a few comments concerning the work of UNIDO. We note with satisfaction the significant progress that has been achieved by this organization on its projected programme of work for 1977 and  in particular  the successful conclusion of the work on the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency of the United Nations. I believe we shall have the pleasant task during this session of adopting that constitution so that UNIDO can be formally launched as a specialized agency.164.	The drawing up of the Constitution of UNIDO should not be regarded as an end in itself. The objective of the exercise of converting UNIDO into a specialized agency was to produce an organization which would be effective and more responsive to the needs for generating industry in the developing countries and sharing more effectively industrial know-how among all nations. The conversion is now accomplished and what remains to be done is to put the new UNIDO to work. My delegation calls upon the Assembly to give UNIDO all the material assistance that it needs to accomplish its enormous task.165.	I note that UNIDO has made progress in other fields as well. First  my Government has followed with interest the discussions which have been going on in Geneva in the area of transfer of technology. In this connexion the establishment of an industrial and technological information bank  even though on a pilot basis  is a welcome development. We have also noted with interest the launching in Lagos in May this year of the Association of African Industrial Technology Organizations. The launching of this regional organization in such a vital area is indeed a development in the right direction.166.	I would like  in passing  to sound a word both of support and caution in connexion with the system of consultations and co-operation between non-governmental organizations and various United Nations bodies including ""JNIDO. The non-governmental organizations have a genuine contribution to offer  but care should be taken to ensure that the meetings should not make an inordinate call on the limited resources at the disposal of the United Nations. I have noted from the document that was produced at the end of the meeting of 24 and 25 May that the non-governmental organizations expect UNIDO to organize meetings on a regular basis My delegation would like to suggest that the non-governmental organizations should  if possible  shoulder the responsibility of organizing the meetings so that the resources of UNIDO can be devoted to tasks set before it by this Assembly.167.	The political situation has not improved much over the past several months. Local wars erupt at a frequency that poses a danger to regional and international stability. It is important that these skirmishes should not be fanned into major wars by big Power rivalries.168.	Much remains to be done in Cyprus  the Middle East  southern Africa  the field of disarmament and in the dialogue between the developer and developing countries regarding the new international economic order. Indeed  in some of these areas such as the Middle East and South Africa  the situation has further deteriorated. In his lucid and objective report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General stresses the urgency of the problems in these words:""... the dangers of delay and the risk of a rapid deterioration which might destroy the possibility of peaceful solutions have become more apparent than ever."" This  in our view  is an accurate appraisal of the international situation and we derive no comfort from it.169.	The primary concern of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security  a goal illusive and difficult of attainment because of mistrust and dishonesty in our political relationships and political dealings. The paradox is that everyone talks about the brotherhood of man  the desirability of international peace and security  coexistence among nations  and international co-operation  while at the same time States are engaged in the political subversion of other States  there are military invasions and territorial annexations  the arms race proceeds apace and deadly weapons ^re being manufactured and stockpiled. Nor can we hope to achieve and maintain international peace and security in a world where the majority of humanity lacks the barest necessities of life and where racial and other forms of domination have not been completely eradicated.170.	It is a sad indictment of our times that while mankind yearns for the improvement of the quality of life  billions are being spent on armaments. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reveals that in 1976 the world spent about $334 billion on armaments. Two major alliances  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  spent about 70 per cent of this staggering sum between them. By comparison  the WHO budget for1977 is a paltry $147 million! This is a shocking manifestation of deranged and distorted priorities  especially at a time when the international community is striving for a new international economic order. In addition to the disconcerting stockpiling of nuclear arsenals there in even the reality of their proliferation.171.	This Assembly might wonder why a small underdeveloped country such as Botswana trespasses on the preserve of the mighty  instead of concerning itself with agriculture and the raising of beef cattle-. The reason is that we in southern Africa are brought into the orbit of a nuclear threat from South Africa. I shall have the opportunity later in this statement to comment further on how this new development affects my country. For now  Botswana  wishes solemnly to draw the attention of those who have made it possible for South Africa to acquire nuclear capability by providing it with nuclear material and technology to the perils that this new development poses for Africa and to hold them criminally responsible for whatever disastrous consequences might flow from their action.172.	We feel that the time is long overdue for the implementation of a complete nuclear test ban  including atmospheric and underground tests.173.	Disarmament is the concern of all nations regardless of their size  wealth or technological advancement  and our Organization should play its full role in the search for solutions. For this reason Botswana joined the other non-aligned countries in calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We regard the special session as a necessary prelude to  and not necessarily a substitute for  a world disarmament conference.174.	The two super-Powers have special responsibility for the future of the world. They should take the lead in disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  if we are to ensure the continuity of organic and other forms of life on our planet.175.	Peace continues to elude the people of Cyprus. The territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus continue to be violated despite the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council. About 45 per cent of Cyprus is under the occupation of foreign troops without the consent of the Cypriot Government. There is growing danger that  unless a solution to the problem is found soon  the occupation will become permanent and result in the partitioning of Cyprus on ethnic lines  contrary to General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolution 365 (1974). This body has called for an end to unilateral actions that could adversely affect the success of the negotiations. We once again call for a just solution to the question of Cyprus  a solution which will ensure the territorial integrity of that country and relieve both communities of the anxieties caused by mutual suspicion and mistrust. We request the Secretary- General and his Special Representative in Cyprus to continue to explore all avenues which might lead to a just and lasting solution  and thus reduce tension in that area.176.	The Middle East continues to be an area of conflict and a threat to international peace and security. Contrary to the principle of non-acquisition of land by force  Israel continues illegally to set up settlements on  and even extend its laws to  the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967. This action is in defiance of the Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and other United Nations resolutions calling for withdrawal to the 1967 borders. We recognize the complexities of the problem. The state of affairs fills one with apprehension that the parties to the conflict may harden their portions and leave no room for flexibility and the creation of an atmosphere conducive to peace negotiations without which hostilities cannot end. We believe that the question of the Palestine Liberation Organization is central to any peaceful settlement in the region. The United Nations has recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and it is therefore imperative that the Palestine Liberation Organization  together with Israel and the neighbouring Arab States  should participate in the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East if an enduring and just solution to the problem is to be found. We call for the creation of a Palestinian homeland without delay just as we recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist.177.	The question of Belize continues to concern my delegation. The people of Belize are entitled to self- determination. We call upon the Government of the United Kingdom  as the administering Power  to act in close consultation with the Governments of Guatemala and Belize to resolve this problem speedily so that the people of Belize may exercise their right to self-determination and independence.178.	Botswana feels strongly about world problems other than the ones I have just discussed. France continues to violate the unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros by its occupation of Mayotte. Botswana's position on this issue is unequivocal. We call upon France to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Comoros.179.	The continued presence of foreign troops in Korea delays negotiations leading to the unification of that country  and hence the reduction of tension. Botswana calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea if unification of the country is to be hastened. It should be the Koreans—and they alone—who should determine their political direction.180.	The problem of Namibia persists despite the far- reaching concessions made by SWAPO in its quest for a peaceful settlement and independence. The armed struggle continues and is likely to increase in intensity unless South Africa abandons its hard-line attitude concerning the withdrawal of its troops and their replacement by a peace-keeping force under the supervision of the United Nations  and desists from creating new problems such as the question of Walvis Bay.181.	Africa has often criticized South Africa's trading partners and military allies for their failure to exert the maximum influence possible to bring about change in southern Africa. It has been a matter of great concern and deep disappointment to us that the denial of human rights to millions of Africans in the minority-ruled States of southern Africa could evoke only mild resentment in theWest. The efforts now being deployed by the five Western members of the Security Council in exploring ways for achieving a peaceful negotiated settlement in Namibia encourage my country to believe that a change of attitude may have come. We welcome this initiative and we also acknowledge with appreciation the readiness of the Nordic countries to offer their services within the framework of United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolution 385(1976)  to facilitate a peaceful transition. Nothing less than genuine independence for the people of Namibia will be acceptable to the international community.182.	The way to a peaceful transition  as we see it  lies in the release of detainees  the guaranteed safe return of refugees and exiles  free political activity by all Namibians in a country rid of the fear of South African occupying security forces  and adequate provision for the maintenance of law and order by a United Nations peace-keeping force. These are modest conditions which should be acceptable to all parties concerned to ensure that the people of Namibia  without intimidation from any quarter  exercise their unimpeded rights to self-determination. South Africa should reconsider its past opposition to these conditions and allow the people of Namibia to progress to independence without further delay and loss of life.183.	Twelve years have elapsed since Southern Rhodesia was illegally declared independent. The problem is still with us despite many attempts in the past to resolve it. It deteriorates progressively and the repression of the majority by the minority has increased  as has racial discrimination. The regime has now resorted to the tactic of promoting internal differences in the liberation movement  discrediting some and commending others as reasonable and amenable to an internal settlement.184.	But the victims of repression and discrimination long ago reached the limits of their endurance and have increasingly resisted oppression. There are those who persistently admonish the people of Zimbabwe against the use of violent means to achieve their independence. The people of Zimbabwe have for many years sought  without success  to resolve the problem peacefully. They resorted to violence because all avenues of peaceful resistance had been closed to them. We in Africa support them. The restoration of their dignity enhances our own.185.	Reactions to the Anglo-American proposals on Rhodesia are pouring in from both inside Rhodesia itself and the outside world. There is no need for me to emphasize that such reactions are varied and sum up very eloquently the dilemmas  inconsistencies and contradictions which beset the Zimbabwe scene. Suffice it to say that Botswana cherishes no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. Our involvement in the liberation struggle is thrust upon us by the fact of geography  the reality of history and our abhorrence of oppression and racism. With the rest of Africa we support the armed struggle as prosecuted by the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe and shall continue to do so for as long as the minority racist regime in Salisbury makes it difficult to reach an agreed settlement.186.	The Anglo-American proposals would not have been brought forward but for the persistence and growing success of the liberation movement. In the view of my country  it would be premature to acclaim or condemn the proposals as they stand. They will be counted successful only if all the parties concerned can use them as a basis for negotiating the transition to independence  free elections based on universal adult suffrage and a society in which all the people participate. They will have served no useful purpose if they fail.187.	Yes  Botswana regards the proposals as a basis for negotiations by all concerned. We consider negotiations as an opportunity to examine the proposals carefully  constructively to amend  adjust or even restructure them as appropriate in the search for an acceptable solution. We therefore exhort all the people of Zimbabwe to use the proposals to negotiate and establish the vital foundation of enduring nationhood whose destiny transcends the mortal life and personal subjective interests of contemporary men and women.188.	We welcome Britain's effort to reassume its role as the colonial Power to bring Rhodesia to an orderly transition  majority rule and independence.189.	When the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia have been resolved there will still remain the problem of South Africa-apartheid and racism and what they connote. This old problem is progressively compounded by the many inhumane laws enacted to support the system. It is complicated by the increasing resistance to it by the oppressed people of that country.190.	Pliny  a first-century Roman natural historian  is reported to have remarked ""Ex Africa semper ali quid novi"" (""There is always something new from Africa""). Had he lived in our day he would no doubt have said ""... out of southern Africa"".191.	When we met at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly the tragedy that is Soweto was one of our major preoccupations. Schoolchildren had taken to the streets and defied in broad daylight the armoury assembled for their subjugation. We know the record of casualties: hundreds lost their lives. That did not deter the thousands who continue to challenge the legal instruments of their oppression. When that happened  the world shuddered— civilized standards  the brotherhood of man  the sanctity of human life-loud protestations and condemnations rose but then died down; trade  treaty and other relations continued.192.	The Transkei bantustan was about to be granted bogus independence last year—a summation of racism and apartheid. The OAU and the United Nations reacted strongly to that strange form of nation-building— Balkanization rather than unification  encouraged and legalized secession in the place of integration and cohesion-a new concept ex Africa.193.	The fears of Africa that the creation of bantustan states would cause problems for the people of southern Africa have been confirmed. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act has deprived the people of the Transkei and everybody else anywhere who are ethnically classified as Xhosa of their rights as nationals of South Africa; they have become aliens in the country of their birth. The Kingdom of Lesotho has already had occasion to complain to the Security Council about the problems arising from the creation of a Bantustan state on its borders with South Africa.194.	As we meet at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly the tragedy of Soweto continues  and many who had the courage to associate  themselves with protests are either refugees or prisoners—if the guns of the Apartheid State and the inexplicable accidents in mysterious circumstances have not claimed their lives. We think in particular of Steven Biko. He has joined Chief Luthuli  Joseph M. Mdluli and many other freedom fighters.195.	Now Bophuthatswana  another affront to the dignity of sovereignty  is hoisting flags and bunting  building dais and stadium to become yet another client state-the brain-child of implacable racism and a symbol of the enduring myth of white superiority. The problems which the creation of that state will cause Botswana are  as in the case of Lesotho and the Transkei  many and serious. We view the establishment of such states on our borders as a deliberate act designed to shift the focus of strife from South Africa itself to border conflicts and tensions which are sure to arise.196.	Rumours of the demarcation of a nuclear testing area in the Kalahari region of Namibia are rife. Botswana does not possess the technical capability to verify  confirm or deny such reports. However  Owen Horwood  the South African Minister of Finance  was recently reported as having said that South Africa reserves the right to use its nuclear potential for other than peaceful purposes to suit its own needs. South Africa is not a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.197.	Of one thing we are certain  that is  Botswana shares the Kalahari semi-desert with Namibia and South Africa. We therefore view with apprehension and concern any nuclear tests there as a danger to the health and security of the people of Botswana. We are informed by those who know that fall-out material from nuclear explosions can be lethal. If indeed the Kalahari is to become a nuclear testing area  I wish to state categorically that Botswana has not been consulted and that we take this opportunity to protest in the strongest terms against any such development. Those who encourage nuclear proliferation should provide testing facilities for South Africa in their own countries. If it is indeed true that the Kalahari is to become a nuclear testing area  I here and now give notice that Botswana will bring- a formal protest to this Organization.198.	Botswana is further concerned at what appears to be some psychological preparation of world opinion for an invasion of Botswana's territory. Rebel Smith has consistently conjured up imaginary nationalist bases in Botswana as a pretext for launching attacks against us. The South African Minister of Justice  Police and Prisons has now also begun to hear noises and to see images resembling nationalist guerrillas in some training bases in Botswana and accused them of committing acts of terror in the urban areas of South Africa. Often  apparitions may be dismissed as symptoms of a congested brain  or manifestations of a guilty mind  or even haunting fears of some impending calamity  bygone days men wore fetishes and talismans  or amulets  or defensive charms and carried mascots to exorcize or propitiate such apparitions  but those seen in this day and age in a country with a massive army and a wide intelligence network  a country with no respect for African life and dignity  a country which claims that its defensible territory extends throughout Africa south of the equator  can bring nothing but serious concern to people in whose country they are alleged to have been seen. Botswana denies here  as it has denied many times before  the existence of any such training bases and issues an open invitation to those who wish to verify their facts to visit Botswana for the purpose.199.	The foregoing awesome account of the turn of events in South Africa causes concern and fills one with trepidation. The threat to international peace and security has become a reality. The Western Powers  the protection of whose culture and civilization South Africa uses as a pretext  should exert all pressure to bring that country to the realization that the spirit of man struggling for freedom is indestructible and  by that means  return it to the path of peaceful inevitable change.200.	The international community has for too long engaged in sterile shadow-boxing with the champions of racism and oppression. The efforts of the non-aligned countries and all those who cherish freedom to bring about meaningful change and majority rule and thus restore to the peoples of southern Africa their basic rights have  year after year  been frustrated and obstructed. Botswana prides itself on upholding its fundamental constitutional principles- non-racialism  equality  human rights  free and fair elections  majority rule and the rule of law. What we desire and strive for in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa is nothing less."
"21",1146,"CAF",32,1977,"﻿130.	 This universe  full of clash and clamour  can it become more harmonious in its very diversity? Harmony  diversity/ peace  justice  equality: these are the ideals which our Organization embraced after the worst test that mankind has ever been put to. Man was revealed in all his nakedness  his moral bankruptcy  his monstrousness.131.	But some 30 years later  the world is facing a crisis  and beyond the challenges of illiteracy  famine  malnutrition  economic disorder  armaments and ideological wars  we discern a rather bleak future. We must avert it.132.	Before continuing my reflections  would this august body allow me to perform the pleasant duty of transmitting to it the best -wishes for its encouragement and full success of His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I  whose coronation will coincide with the end of this session. His Majesty expresses the ardent hope that our work can go forward in tolerance and calm  so that we can find the proper ways and means to promote a lasting peace  real detente and a new and more just international economic order.133.	The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been able firmly to translate into practice these principles which are dear to my country: those of non-alignment and genuine national development. Therefore  on behalf of the Central African delegation  I warmly welcome the election of the President for the thirty-second session. His experience and expertise in international affairs  I am sure  gives him the capacity to lead our work to a successful conclusion.134.	My congratulations go also to. Mr. Amsrasinghe  the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka  for the perfect tact he showed as President of the previous session.135.	We express to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim all our support  our deep sympathy  for the delicate and valuable task he has in seeing to it that the purposes and principles of the Charter are observed. He does this task with the modesty and discretion we have come to expect of him and which are guarantees of his effectiveness. Quite rightly  my country voted for his second term.136.	The Central African Empire welcomes with particular pleasure and pride the admission to our Organization of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Those countries have shown us yet again  through their heroic struggle and their determination  that the just cause always wins. We are sure that the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will bring new life to our Organization.137.	I mentioned a rather bleak future.138.	In southern Africa  the stronger the wind of freedom blows  and the greater black awareness becomes  the more violent become the death throes of the minority regimes and the greater grows the risk of conflagration throughout the continent. Here and in other bodies  my country has said  and I repeat  that the Central African Empire joins the international community in reaffirming its condemnation of any discrimination for reasons of race  colour or creed. My country  the melting-pot of African civilizations at the heart of Africa  holds the position traced by the philosophy of our great national party  the Movement for Social Development of Black Africa  the philosophy of ""Zo Kwe Zo"" and ""Zo Ay eke Zo"": in other words  every man is a man.139.	In Namibia  the Central African Empire reaffirms its support for all the authentic forces  and particularly the South West Africa People's Organization  and will continue to support initiatives such as those already under way  to see to it that in 1978  finally  that Territory will become effectively independent.140.	Zimbabwe is still a source of concern. So many efforts have been made to re-establish legality and justice.141. Despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at Geneva and Maputo and by the front-line States  Ian Smith entrenches himself in his position by a number of clever delaying tactics. Such an attitude is without a future and can only lead to chaos. Events cannot be deflected from their course. The black majority will inevitably come to power under the flag of the Patriotic Front  recognized at the last session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Libreville in July.142. These hotbeds of tension  which will soon be eliminated  have  unfortunately  been joined by others. Africa has become the field of choice for hegemonic conflict and an attempt is being made to implant foreign ideologies. From this rostrum I affirm and proclaim that the Central African people has chosen its path and nothing can deflect it from it. We dare to believe that the expression ""Africa for the Africans"" will be heard and understood throughout the world.143.	International peace is dangerously threatened in the Middle East. The refusal to recognize the identity and the individuality of the Palestinian people  the occupation of Arab lands  the plundering of the land of the Arab populations  the difficulties of coexistence between communities with different origins and religious beliefs constitute  in our opinion  among other causes  the signal characteristics of this explosive situation.144.	Despite the establishment of committees of all kinds  the peace plans proposed here and there and the goodwill missions which have followed one on the other  tension continues to increase.145.	Thus we note  with apprehension  that the delays in a settlement of the question constantly give the highest degree of concern to the international community  because of the latest events which have escalated the confrontations  bringing wounds and bloodshed to the region.146.	Over and above all the differences  we consider that there is a people which has a right' to a fatherland and to recognition of its legitimate rights: that is the Palestinian people.147.	However  within the framework of a peaceful settlement laid down by our Organization  the parties in conflict must find the political will to seek solutions which transcend all other motivations. In any case  my country will continue to bring all its support to the effective application of the relevant resolutions adopted by our Organization  among others  resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council  for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region.148.	In the Eastern Mediterranean  that is in Cyprus  efforts have been undertaken  within the framework of a peaceful settlement of the matter  on the basis of resolutions 3212 (XXDC) and 3395 (XXX)  but little progress has been made.149.	The Central African Empire will contribute to any initiatives  within .the framework of our Organization  to preserve the independence of Cyprus and initiate a reconciliation between the two communities within an indivisible and free State.150.	I cannot pass over in silence the terrible problem of the arms race which involves ever more murderous and sophisticated weaponry. Everything leads us to believe that international detente  which has been so ardently sought by our Organization is far from having been attained. The nuclear and thermonuclear tests  the control of the seas and oceans for military and hegemonic purposes and the insidious proliferation of atomic and conventional arms make disarmament  we must say  a distant prospect. What would we not do to devote this infinite potential of intelligence  knowledge and colossal wealth that has been thus diverted to the solution of the problems of poverty  ignorance and disease  which are the lot of most of the inhabitants of the world.151.	-My country will never stop protesting most vigorously against the folly of this headlong charge to death and will support always and in every forum the promotion of the kind of peace which is not necessarily just the absence of war but a true peace between peoples. Therefore  we optimistically await the special session of the General Assembly and the World Disarmament Conference.152.	This analysis of the international situation should serve to strengthen within our Organization our will to bring about necessary and urgent changes in a spirit of sincere friendship  tolerance and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.153.	Almost a year ago my country underwent a radical change at the institutional level. On 4 December 1976  the Central African people  united in the national party  the Movement for the Social Development of Black Africa  freely and in complete sovereignty adopted a new Constitution which raises the Republic to an Empire and proclaims His Majesty Bokassa the first Emperor.154.	This act of national sovereignty  the establishment of the Central African constitutional monarchy  demonstrates the originality and the will of the Central African people to confirm  in national independence  a new democracy designed to bring about the full flowering of the Central African personality and the harmonious economic development of the Empire.155.	Hence  concerned to associate the Central African people closely with their own destiny  the Constitution provides for a National Assembly elected by universal suffrage and an Economic and Social Council  and makes the Supreme Court the supreme guardian of constitutional freedoms.156.	Furthermore  the Constitution accords the Central African people the fundamental rights laid down in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and  in particular  confers upon Central African youth and women a special place enabling them to affirm their identity and play their full part in the nation.157.	Finally  the Constitution makes the Emperor the arbitrator and regulator of the proper functioning of the institutions. He symbolizes the national unity of the Empire and assures its. enduring future.158.	Every country freely chooses its path  and does so in strict observance of the fundamental principles of our Charter. The Central African people has chosen its path  in accordance with its aspirations.159.	We wish for peace. My country — another Switzerland - has always wanted and always sought peace  basing itself on sincere friendship as the way to better co-operation with respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. It is our expectation that the same should be true reciprocally.160.	That is why we shall respond to any attempt at interference in our internal affairs and any attempt to lay down the law to us. Let those who seek to give lessons  and whose acts tend to do the most harm to relations between States  reflect on these words of Alain Peyrefitte: ""We cannot have an insight into the present situation without an insight into history."" Let these givers of lessons look into their own history.161.	What can be said that has not already been said about the pressing need to establish a new international economic order based on equity  growth and above all  justice?162.	My country  which is land-locked  feels acutely the effects of economic and financial- disorder  particularly the deterioration in the terms of trade aggravated by inflation.163.	Of course  many conferences and approaches to the matter have been either held or proposed. The last to date  the North-South dialogue  despite a few agreements obtained  has not produced the results so long awaited by the developing countries. None the less  we must note that a move has been made  as we must fully appreciate the Lome Convention between the European Economic Community and countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific.164.	Furthermore  the problem of the release from indebtedness of . the developing countries  particularly those countries most affected  must find a rapid solution  if we are to be able to talk of solidarity. Similarly  the specific conditions  and needs of the developing countries must be taken into consideration on the basis of preferential treatment  in accordance with the economic declaration of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Colombo in August 1976.165.	It is in this spirit that the Central African delegation appeals to the developed countries and the international organizations to facilitate the transfer of resources by increasing the real value and volume of assistance to developing countries  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3362 (S-VII) of the seventh special session. My country also supports the idea of convening a conference of donor  creditor and debtor countries to study the means of easing the burden of indebtedness of the third world.166.	My country also supports unreservedly all measures aimed at putting an end to the devious practices of transnational corporations and at drawing up an international code of conduct for this purpose.167.	The establishment of a new international economic order is a long-term collective task  of course  but the fundamental problem remains the awareness and the political will of the ""have"" countries to bring this about.168.	It is up to the disadvantaged countries to strengthen their solidarity  because the primary responsibility for their development is their own.169.	In this respect  the results of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Mexico last year  and of the ministerial conference on economic co-operation among African countries  held at Kinshasa also in 1976  are highly encouraging.170.	Furthermore; the success of the First Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States  held in Cairo this year  also gives cause for satisfaction. The important measures laid down in the declaration  the programme of action and the agreement on the organization and methods to be adopted form a sure basis for a relationship of co-operation between Africans and Arabs in the political  economic  financial  commercial  technical and scientific fields.171.	We are sure that such horizontal co-operation is part of the irreversible tide of history.172.	We certainly expect a great deal from international co-operation  but it must be in addition to national efforts. The Central African Empire  within the framework of ""operation Bokassa""—a strategy for economic and social development—is making vast efforts in the struggle against under-development. There are many examples to prove this to men of goodwill. We shall mention here only the case of the port works at Bangui  Mongoumba  mainly financed from the national budget and intended to solve the delicate and difficult problem of the interruption of navigation on the Ubangui.173.	To complete the national effort under the programme to provide an outlet from its land-locked situation  my country sets great hope in the building of a railway between Bangui and the ocean  and in the Trans-Africa Highway between Lagos and Mombasa. The Central African Empire  through me  declares itself ready to accept any assistance making it possible to carry out these ventures  which are vital for its economy and for the exploitation not only of resources already known but also of those revealed by satellite and known as the ""Bangui anomalies"". Of course  this must be in the spirit of dialogue and confidence which the Central African Government has always shown.174.	But the Central African Empire  land-locked country  cannot dissociate the thorny problem of being land-locked from that of the law of the sea. Therefore  it greatly regrets the inconclusiveness of the sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  recently held in New York  as the Central African delegation  from this rostrum on the same occasion last year  had expressed its hope of seeing the work of that Conference achieve positive results.175.	We launch a heart-felt appeal to the countries which have the technology  to their spirit of solidarity  so that a consensus may be found in the negotiations to be held at Geneva in 1978 during the seventh session of that Conference.176.	The position of the Central African Empire is dictated by the following principles of equity: that every country should enjoy freedom of transit and access to the sea; that  since the high seas are open to all States  the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the exclusive economic zones are the common heritage of mankind; and that the exploitation of those immense resources must not be carried out only for the benefit of those countries which have the advanced technology but also for the benefit of mankind as a whole.177.	Finally  in the same spirit  we also appeal to the international community and its various organizations to ensure that special terms for transport are offered to the land-locked countries of the third world.178.	After having mentioned and considered with representatives the events that are of concern to our world in this third decade of the United Nations  I cannot but reflect on the progress made in the twentieth century.179.	Intelligence  science and technical expertise have dangerously increased man's power  giving a more than disquieting dimension to his instinct of domination. A system of ethics is needed to make him aware of his actions and his responsibility towards others.180.	That restraining influence  that rampart of solidarity  is of course to be found in the United Nations. That is a human endeavour subject to success but also to vicissitudes. None the less my country  the Central African Empire  remains optimistic and is confident about it  because the United Nations remains the privileged place where together  large and small  rich and poor  we can deliberate and seek ways and means likely to create effective conditions for co-operation for peace and international security.181.	On 20 October 1970  from this rostrum  His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I  on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  said:""The Second United Nations Development Decade ought to be both the Second Development Decade and the disarmament decade. I think it would be pointless to refer to a disarmament decade if an ever-growing multiplicity of situations of wretchedness  hunger and frustration did not give hundreds of millions of men  who would have little to fear from an apocalyptic death from modern weapons  the ultimate recourse of a different sort of death  but one which in the end analysis is just as final.""182.	Those words still hold good today and  in closing  I should like to join representatives in hoping that tomorrow will be a more cheerful outlook. Let us hope that at least it will be less bleak."
"22",1190,"CAN",32,1977,"﻿42.	 Mr. President  I am pleased to be one of the first speakers to congratulate you on your election  which my delegation regards as a tribute both to your personal qualities and to the important role your country has played in the United Nations. In agreeing to preside not only over our annual deliberations this autumn  but also over next year's important special session on disarmament  you have accepted a heavy responsibility. I know you will fulfil it with distinction.43.	This year we welcome two new Members to the Assembly  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. As a member of the Security Council  Canada was pleased to recommend both countries for membership  and we look forward to working with them in this Organization.44.	Like others who will participate in this debate  I have received much advice on what I should say that might be helpful in solving the many problems we face. It has been a frustrating experience.45.	I have concluded regrettably that I could read my last year's speech again  word for word  and no one would notice the repetition  nor would they care! The sad truth is that every serious issue I and many others raised last year remain unresolved and some now pose a greater threat to peace and security than they did 12 months ago. It has not been a good year for the United Nations.46.	Small wonder that our deliberations have so little relevance for our publics back home or for the many millions around the world whom we are committed to help but who have become disillusioned and cynical about our ability to fill answers to what are in many cases  matters of life and death.47.	I make these judgments with regret. No country has been more consistent than Canada in supporting the principles of the United Nations. We do not have to apologize for our record here or for the attitude of the Canadian people in accepting responsibilities for peacekeeping  for leadership in the North-South dialogue and for making a fair contribution to all United Nations initiatives. Canada and Canadians have earned the right to be heard and what Canadians are saying is that the performance of the United Nations is not good enough.48.	Canada does not  of course  exclude itself from all blame for this inadequate record. Like other countries  there are times when we get our priorities mixed and lack the proper sense of urgency in dealing with new or continuing threats to world order and security. Nor am I interested merely in pointing the finger at others for the dubious pleasure of giving vent to my own frustrations. I speak as I do because I know that many of you share my views. It is not our sense of commitment that is flagging; no one in his right mind would wilfully project the world towards more bloodshed and potential global conflict. All of us want peace and order in international affairs.49.	Yet we are trapped in the tangled thickets of history  of fear  suspicion  and ancient deep-seated antagonisms. Self-interest usually prevails over our efforts to define and foster larger  more generous objectives. I am aware of the conviction of many in this Organization and elsewhere that this is the reality of international affairs- the real world  as they call it—that glaring imperfections are a normal and unavoidable part of the human condition and that we must resign ourselves to the mere containment of the most virulent and dangerous manifestations of human greed and irrationality  accepting that the world's fate is to stumble on from one crisis to the next. There are grounds for healthy scepticism  I agree; but in the United Nations that scepticism gives way too often to resignation and to a form of professional cynicism that views all new approaches as yet another example of short-lived idealistic naiveté.50.	Let me assure you that I am not naive; but I cannot accept  Canada cannot accept  that this Organization and its Member States are powerless to remove the root-causes of those major tensions that now require all of us to live out our lives in the constant shadow of impending disaster.51.	There is among us another widely held view that  while any country can light a fire  only the super-Powers have the option of either fuelling its flames or putting it out. There is  of course  a key role for the large  wealthy and powerful nations and their actions should not be greeted by automatic mistrust. But for smaller countries to do nothing or adhere blindly and unquestioningly to this or that power bloc is to avoid responsibility and to make a mockery of the United Nations and the opportunity it provides for reasoned  free and open debate.52.	However awesome the outcome of super-Power decision-making and action can be  we must never forget that many of today's flash-points are not of their making. Many smaller countries have shown that they are perfectly capable entirely on their own of causing problems for all of us. And such actions are all the more reprehensible when they risk or even invite the escalation of East-West tensions.53.	If we are to make progress here  there must be an end to the sterile debates of recent years where the outcome is always a foregone conclusion. If the vitality of open debate is not restored to the United Nations then increasingly the important decisions affecting the fate of mankind will be made elsewhere and this Organization and most of its agencies will wither into insignificance and  eventually  unlamented oblivion.54.	Lest any consider this too harsh a judgment and too pessimistic a forecast  I ask you to recall objectively the reaction of many of our own publics to United Nations deliberations and resolutions. My own experience at home and around the world has been bad.55.	Granted these criticisms are often based on prejudice or ignorance. But we know too that much can and should be done to make the United Nations more effective. I propose to give certain examples as well as suggestions for improvement.56.	Two of the main issues that will come before us at this session are the Middle East and southern African situations. Last year we adopted 20 resolutions on the Middle East and no less than 34 on questions related to southern Africa. To what purpose was all that time and effort  not to mention money  expended? The answer is surely  very little  because many of those resolutions simply expressed moral judgments and were devoid of practical proposals for action. Furthermore  everyone knew that they had little if any prospect of being implemented. Yet the vast and increasingly expensive machinery of the United Nations ground on not only through the 50-odd resolutions I have mentioned but through nearly 200 more  many in the same category and thus predestined to suffer the same fate. Already gathering dust  I suspect  is the 400-page compendium of those resolutions  most echoing word for word the deliberations of previous years.57.	No one should be surprised therefore at the indifference with which the media and the public greet their publication. By adopting more resolutions we have succeeded paradoxically in ensuring that they receive less  not more  attention. Changing our collective habits will not be easy. By passing more resolutions we are certainly letting our situation deteriorate. We should scrutinize the agenda closely to resist the automatic re-inclusion of old items and the addition of less essential new ones. We should group items so that similar debates will not take place in different committees on closely related subjects. We should avoid the proliferation of resolutions which express the Members' aspirations or objectives but do not contribute in a practical way to achieving any of them. A few short  precise and practical resolutions will have more impact than the many rambling and ineffective ones we now consider each year.58.	As a member once each decade of the Security Council  Canada has accumulated some experience but also has a chance to take a fresh look at its activities every time we return. So far this year  the Council has debated several significant issues in a sensible  restrained fashion. None of us would claim  however  that it has done much to enhance its position as the United Nations organ with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Our Secretary-General has wisely warned us of the risk that there may come  in his words   a time when the Council is desperately needed and will be found to be too weak to fulfil its responsibilities.59.	The problems arise  not because of weaknesses in the Council's structure or powers but  rather  from a lack of impetus. To give a greater sense of purpose to the Council  the Charter provides for periodic meetings at which members be represented by a Cabinet member or other specially designated representative. Remarkably  Mr. President  as you well know  the Council held the first of such meetings in its history at the time of the twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations. This Assembly welcomed the Council's intention to hold further periodic meetings  but none has taken place.60.	I propose that the Security Council should begin meeting regularly at ministerial level. Fifteen ministers meeting together could give a new sense of life and political purpose to the Council. Instead of following a formal agenda  they could have a free discussion of major issues of international peace and security  based on  perhaps  a special report by the Secretary-General. The meetings should be held in an informal atmosphere  without a small army of advisers  thus allowing the ministers to exchange views informally. Meetings at ministerial level should be held once or twice a year rather than once every 25 years. The first meeting might well be devoted to finding ways to make the work of the Council more relevant to the major issues of peace and security.61.	When I spoke here last year  I suggested that the Economic and Social Council should be given a more significant role. At its spring and summer sessions  the Council considers a bewildering variety of issues. It has even less success in what should be its central task-setting priorities and  coordinating the work of this family of organizations in the economic  social  cultural  educational  health and related fields. My delegation believes that the Council should have more frequent and shorter sessions. At each of these it could deal thoroughly with one group of subjects  covering all of its agenda over a two-year period. From time to time the Council should also meet at ministerial level to review major economic or social questions when policy considerations justify participation at this level. In all United Nations organs  I welcome new practices of informal consultation and negotiations through contact groups which help to turn the United Nations from a deliberative body into a real negotiating forum.62.	We must also work for an improvement in the work of the specialized agencies. Many of them have a distinguished record. But our method for controlling the system as a whole has been unsatisfactory. We have been good at devising new programmes  but less so at identifying ones which are obsolete or at preventing duplication. One result has been an escalation of costs. A few years ago one of my predecessors complained to the Assembly that the assessed budgets of the United Nations family of organizations had doubled in 10 years. Now they have more than doubled in five. We shall have to ensure that budgets are kept down  and that money is spent only on subjects that have the highest priority.63.	A second problem with the specialized agencies has been the extent to which they have-been turned from their main purposes to deal with the political issues which are the responsibility of this Assembly. Canada is determined to resist this process. We have been particularly concerned about the ILO. We value that organization for its record of achievement on human rights and its unique contribution to the United Nations system as a whole. We are anxious to preserve the impartiality and authority of its procedures so that a member State will not be condemned without impartial investigation. I believe that many members share our views and will work together for this purpose.64.	These proposals deal principally with improvements in our procedures. If implemented  and I confess quite frankly that I am by no means sanguine that they will be  they would put us in a better position to deal with the important issues; but the complexity of the issues themselves will no: be lessened.65.	Although they manifest themselves in a variety of troubling ways  including open conflicts  it is now apparent that the principal concerns of most Members here are  in fact  economic. The United Nations and its agencies have their work cut out for them if we are to move closer to a more just and equitable world economic order. The barriers to success are enormous as unemployment and inflation continue to plague even the wealthiest countries. Unless a spirit of reasonableness prevails  unless demands and responses are tailored to present economic realities  I must caution that even in Canada  which is far from being the least generous of the developed countries  pressures will develop to focus on our own considerable problems even to the exclusion of the international consequences. I need hardly tell the Assembly that we are not alone in this difficulty.66.	Canada's goal is to build on the foundations it helped to create through its co-chairmanship of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. Given the proper climate we will work hard to devise a strategy that is both broadly acceptable and realistic. In the coming weeks  Canada's representatives here and at other United Nations and related meetings will announce additional Canadian financial commitments to a large number of international organizations. I shall not take time today to relate the details. I do wish  however  to say a word about food aid.67.	The world food shortage has been eased by good harvests in many countries. However  the factors which gave rise to the recent crisis are still present  and  as many representatives know  recent studies concur in the likelihood of a shortfall in the next five to ten years. One proposal to improve world food security concerns the idea of a 500 000-ton emergency grain reserve. Canada previously announced a willingness to contribute  along with other donors. I am now able to announce that  subject to Parliamentary approval  we would be willing to provide the equivalent of $7.5 million in food grain-roughly 50 000 tons or 10 per cent of the total objective.68.	At this session we must establish the machinery for developing a new international development strategy for the third development decade. This task provides us with a rare opportunity to demonstrate the continuing relevance of the United Nations. We can take advantage of it  or we can allow our  deliberations to deteriorate into sterile rhetorical exchanges which will sap the goodwill of those who must give and deepen the bitterness of the receivers. Let us resolve now to choose the first course.69.	Since I last spoke to this Assembly there have been important developments with respect to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This historic Conference illustrates very well some of the best and some of the worst aspects of United Nations deliberations and processes. Without the United Nations there is little doubt that management and control of the oceans and their resources would have deteriorated into anarchy. The Conference is  therefore  one of the United Nations great achievements; its originators and all who have participated deserve great credit. But it is an agonizingly slow process.70.	In the past 12 months many countries  including Canada  have extended their fishing jurisdiction over living resources in their coastal waters out to 200 miles. While it is true that these actions are based upon the common will of States reflected in the draft conference texts  it is also true that before that point could be reached many fish stocks had become dangerously depleted  vital elements of the world's fishing industry were jeopardized and serious confrontations developed between traditionally friendly countries.71.	There are legitimate and complex reasons why the negotiations were difficult. But we cannot ignore the fact either that old habits and patterns are hard to abandon  and it is ironic in some respects that only by acting in advance of the conclusion of the Conference did Canada and countries that took similar action enhance the United Nations and the undoubted value of the Conference. This lesson should  and I hope will  lend new urgency to the important work of the Conference that remains to be completed. We have taken 10 years to come this far  and the gains will be dissipated by a series of unilateral actions unless a comprehensive agreed international regime comes into force very soon.72.	It should be self-evident  but sometimes  strangely  it is not  that all of our painfully slow progress towards a more just and well ordered society rests on the fragile assumption that we can create and preserve a peaceful world. No argument should be necessary in defence of that proposition. Yet we continue to witness new outbreaks of violence and to hear from leaders genuinely convinced that the only path to their objectives leads across the battlefield. That belief is prevalent at present in parts of southern Africa.73.	Soon we shall be discussing the most recent plan for the attainment of majority rule in Rhodesia. Canada fully supports the plan not only because we believe that it provides the basis for a fair and equitable solution but also because we reject totally the alternative of further bloodshed. There must be no lessening of our resolve to see the end of the present illegal minority Rhodesian regime  and for that reason we must redouble our efforts and our commitment to peaceful means. Otherwise  whatever the eventual outcome  it will have about it the smell of failure and the sad realization that good can be achieved only through death and destruction.74.	In the Middle East the issues are even more complex and the dangers to world security proportionately greater. All of us are hoping that present initiatives and negotiations will prove successful and today  as in the past  Canada urges all concerned to recognize fully their awesome responsibility to make every effort and explore every avenue that can lead to a peaceful and permanent solution to longstanding differences.75.	Canada remains committed to the framework for peace embodied in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Our support for Israel's right to exist as defined by those resolutions is firm and unequivocal. We deplore  and we shall continue to do so  all efforts within this Assembly and elsewhere to attribute patently false motives to Israel or to diminish its status and rights within the United Nations or as a legitimate member of the world community.76.	Canada believes that all countries in the region need and have a right to expect more than just another cease-fire or merely a formal end to belligerency. If this kind of peace is to be achieved  the crucial issues of territory must be solved. The only truly secure borders-those which are freely recognized by the parties on either side of them-must be determined by negotiations within the framework of resolution 242 (1967). Until then  we believe that nothing should be done unilaterally or illegally to change or predetermine the status of any part of the occupied territories. We regret that such actions are still being taken without regard to their effect on the prospects for peace. It is also clear that any resolution of territorial issues  if it is indeed to bring-about the lasting peace that all desire  must provide a just  humanitarian and political solution for the Palestinian Arab people by which they can live in peace without threatening the security of any country in the region. Any solution for the Palestinian Arabs must of course include their clear and unequivocal acceptance of Israel's permanent existence as their neighbour. During this Assembly  we should bring our weight to bear to bring about .In early resumption of negotiations and not attempt to substitute empty debates or one-sided resolutions for the complicated  slow  but essential process of working out a settlement by the parties themselves.77.	Obviously  the Middle East situation has reached a crucial stage. For all concerned  these are days of opportunity. We must pray that they act wisely and with a full awareness of the awful consequences of unwise actions.78.	For  whenever there is a potential for conflict these days  we must not only contemplate localized  limited hostilities  frightful as those always are. We know that each new flare-up wherever it occurs in the world is a potential threat to us all and even to world survival. We must remind those who would risk the use of arms that they are endangering more than the lives of their own people. Every weapon fired in anger is aimed  potentially  at the heart of civilization. Thus we have a right and a duty to speak out; for what is at stake's in truth the peace of Canada and of every other country in the world today.79.	Because this is the simple truth  no problem is of greater concern to this Assembly than disarmament  but  equally  no subject has more frustrated our efforts and disappointed our peoples. Next year's special session can provide us with an opportunity to move towards real disarmament. Canada was a sponsor of the resolution calling for the session  and we shall put forward specific proposals to make it a success.80.	But we cannot wait for the special session. The need is immediate to improve and strengthen the international non-proliferation system  implement the non-proliferation Treaty more effectively and re-examine the risks and benefits in various nuclear cycles and processes.81.	If anything is more frightening than the prospect of rapidly escalating local hostilities  it is the nightmare of unrestrained nuclear proliferation with all its attendant horrors. I find it difficult to understand how anyone among the world's leaders could consider that an expansion in the number of nuclear-weapon States would contribute to greater world stability. Canada  despite its known competence in the field  rejected the nuclear-weapons option long ago. Now we are making every effort to ensure that others do likewise. We shall co-operate  in terms of nuclear supplies and technology  only with those countries which have signed the non-proliferation Treaty or are otherwise committed to safeguards of full scope. We are encouraged by the fact that some other nuclear suppliers  including Australia and Sweden  have adopted a similar policy. We hope that there will be more.82.	For Canada recognizes that  with the inevitable decline and increasing costs of conventional energy sources  much of the world will have no choice but to turn to nuclear sources to meet energy demands. We appreciate also that there are legitimate differences of opinion on the question of the safest and most efficient means of utilizing nuclear resources and technology. This is true even in countries whose commitment to non-proliferation is total and unquestioned.83.	Canada therefore welcomes and supports the proposal made at the London summit meeting for a thorough study of alternative fuel cycles that avoid the use of plutonium or improve safeguards. We commend the United States for its initiatives in this field and hope that all countries will give it their full support. This subject is much too broad and too important to be dealt with in a few moments. I hope that this Assembly will provide the time for a full-scale discussion  for there can be no subject of greater importance.84.	Because of Canada's special interest  I hope and expect that there will be an opportunity also to discuss UnitedNations peace-keeping activities. In the Middle East  Cyprus and South Asia  United Nations peace-keeping forces or observer groups are in place. Soon there may be further requests involving Zimbabwe and Namibia.85.	Canada has consistently responded to United Nations requests to provide personnel as available for peace-keeping  because we believe this to be a significant way to contribute to world peace. But in Canada there is growing concern about peace keeping for two reasons. First  many of the disputes which led to the need for peace-keeping forces appear no nearer to solution than they were one  two and even three decades ago. We recognize that these basic and intractable problems may indeed take a lot of time and cannot be settled overnight. What we wish  but do not always see  is evidence that the parties are intent on negotiating an end to their disputes. Secondly  although the two most recent forces-UNEF and the UNDGF-are being property paid for through collective assessment  we have failed to reach general agreement on how future peacekeeping operations should be financed and UNFICYP is over $50 million in debt. If operations are not properly funded  many Members of the United Nations will not be able to afford to provide forces-a situation which will not be healthy either for this Organization or for the concept of peace-keeping.86.	In considering future participation  Canada will weigh these two considerations: whether peace-keeping forces will contribute to a settlement rather than provide temporary relief or even contribute to a perpetuation of the problem  and whether arrangements to pay for them represent the common will of Members to assume the financial burden and permit troop contributors to be selected from a broad cross-section of countries.87.	I have no doubt we will hear a great deal about human rights during the coming months  and not only here at the United Nations. Within a few days the review conference on the Final Act adopted by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki opens in Belgrade. Canada  as one of the signers of that document  will make its views known at that time.88.	But we must also recognize that the United Nations has a major responsibility in the human rights field; one we have not always discharged fully or effectively.89.	Last year we welcomed the coming into force of the International Covenants on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights. Paradoxically  however  at a time when these new human rights instruments have defined more fully the rights of persons in States which have ratified these instruments and have created new machinery to monitor the compliance of Member States with their legal and moral obligations the gap between the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the practice of States has widened noticeably. It is regrettable that only one third of the total membership of the United Nations has ratified the major human rights covenants  and that even fewer States have accepted the Optional Protocol. The various monitoring and reporting procedures are too slow and cumbersome to be truly effective  and offer little tangible assistance to victims of violations.90.	More progress can and must be made in those areas where abuses are flagrant and persistent. We should direct our efforts towards finding a means of monitoring compliance with the Declaration against torture passed by the General Assembly in 1975. We should improve the procedures for screening complaints and for acting on those that reflect serious abuse. We should consider better procedures for co-ordination of all United Nations activity in defence of human rights.91.	We recognize that the Charter of the United Nations obliges Member States to respect the sovereignty of others. But it is surely consistent with acceptance of the principle of non-interference to urge more complete and universal recognition of other freely assumed obligations-the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion.92.	The fact is that on this as on all the other issues I have mentioned the performance of the United Nations and of all of its Member States is being examined more closely and critically than ever before  for the sound and obvious reason that the stakes are higher than ever before.93.	I have spoken critically of some aspects of our past performance and present practices. I have done so not out of any desire to weaken this Organization but because Canada is convinced that without a marked change of attitude on the part of Members and without the reforms that are so clearly necessary  the erosion of the effectiveness and prestige of the United Nations will continue.94.	We must dedicate ourselves to work for this Organization as if our lives depended on it. In truth they probably do. "
"23",1251,"CHL",32,1977,"﻿78.	  I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Lazar Mojsov on his election to preside over the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly of our Organization. I am certain that the fulfilment of his duties will be characterized by the skill that has distinguished his diplomatic career.79.	I should also like to convey to his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations  and the President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  our gratitude for having so wisely and so fairly guided the work of its last session.80.	Chile extends a warm welcome to the new nations recently admitted to this world Organization in keeping with the spirit of universality which is both its inspiration and its raison d'etre.81.	We trust that in the near future the spirit underlying international relations will be improved so as to make possible a more just coexistence among nations and we reaffirm our faith in this institution  which is the most serious effort ever made to ensure a life of peace and justice in this world.82.	We deem it necessary once again to state in this international forum the fundamental principles guiding Chile's foreign policy and its unswerving devotion to them.83.	Our Government has confirmed at the world level its support of the tenets underlying Christian Western culture and has stressed its respect for treaties and other international commitments legally entered into  as a basis for a World order of peace and security. It has also expressed its loyalty to the purposes and principles of this internationalOrganization  whose Charter is the basic legal instrument governing our foreign relations.84.	As stated by the President of the Republic  the Chilean State is evolving towards a democracy whose essential characteristic will be a just equilibrium between rights and duties and between authority and responsibility.85.	The process designed to lead to the new political and institutional regime has three stages: the present one of recovery  then that of transition and finally that of full normality. Once the second stage is completed  a democracy will have been fully established by Chileans  in accordance with their historical traditions and with the greatest possible enhancement of our national character in all its aspects. In that democracy the President and Congress will be elected by votes cast by the citizens. This planned evolution towards a normal situation must not be attributed to weakness on our part vis-à-vis those who pretend to dictate from abroad the path we must follow  for that is a decision taken exclusively in accordance with our national sovereignty.86.	Our normalization process is inextricably linked to the achievement of the goals announced in the planning of the social and economic development of the country  a matter to which our Government is firmly committed.87.	It is an undeniable and fully recognized fact that our economy is now on a solid basis  for it is predicated on a rational and consistent economic policy that has maintained its orientation during the entire period of the present Government's administration.88.	The philosophic basis for this policy is the Government's feeling that mere economic growth cannot be a goal in itself  for it is useless for a country to accumulate wealth and increase its national product if such economic improvements do not better the material  spiritual and moral lot of its inhabitants.89.	The sacrifices exacted by our economic recovery have been substantial  but it is worth pointing out that the progress made in the search for permanent solutions to our social and economic ills has also been substantial.90.	During the-first six months of this year the process of recovery of our economy has been carried on at an accelerated pace  and it is with great satisfaction that we can now say that the outlook is frankly encouraging.91.	At the end of the current year we hope to have achieved a yearly growth rate of 8 per cent in our gross national product. Inflation will be down to practically one third of what it was in 1976; real income will be increased by 25 per cent; and unemployment will be almost half of the 1976 figures.92.	The skilful handling of our economic policy has earned Chile the respect of all international financial organizations  and the country can now look forward to a promising future.93.	Those positive results were obtained with no sacrifice of the long-term objectives of the present economic and social policy  which calls for the allocation of resources to those industries that are capable of producing with comparatively greater efficiency  a decrease in the size of the public sector and  most especially  an ongoing concern for economic development and social justice.94.	Because our basic belief is in the need for rapid economic development and real social progress  the work done directly by the Government stands out as a reflection of its profound concept of every individual as a being with a twofold spiritual and material dimension and as the reason for all the State's activities.95.	Our interpretation of social development is part and parcel of the State's higher policy  which guides us in the pursuit of the objectives we have set for ourselves. We are fully aware that the social aspects are inseparable from the political aspects.96.	Some measures already adopted or still being studied are worthy of special mention in speaking of our social policy: the Social Statute for Business Enterprises; social security reforms; the new Labour Code; the equalization of family allowances and an increase in expenditures for social purposes  which  from a total of 27 per cent of the national budget in 1973  have risen to 51.8 per cent of the current one.97.	Our foreign policy has continued to stress the priority it accords to its relations of friendship and co-operation with America. The historical understanding which is the main feature of the close bonds between Chile and the region is now making progress in promoting the ideals of peace  justice and development98.	This progress is encouraging and enables us to confirm our hope that Chile and all the other countries in the region will persevere in the path they have followed and that Latin America will shape a regional identity that will enable it to assert its own essential character in this hour of confusion for the free world and assume a more active role in the great problems of world policy. This is Chile's wish  and our country knows that it interprets the deepest feelings of people of the Americas  who wish to participate in a mature and realistic fashion in matters of universal scope.99.	The Chilean Government has spared no effort to expedite the diplomatic negotiations aimed at providing the Republic of Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific Ocean and an equally sovereign territory to join that shoreline to the Bolivian plateau.100.	In this connexion we have maintained our offer  accepted basically in December 1975  the terms of which are well known to the international community  and we shall continue our efforts to find ways and means which will enable these negotiations to come to a successful conclusion.101.	We have maintained a permanent dialogue with the Republic of Peru on the many aspects of our common interests. This has led to a fruitful understanding and is reflected in the high level achieved in our relations.102.	With regard to our relations with Argentina  Chile reaffirms its permanent  unalterable support for measures aimed at the peaceful settlement of international disputes and reiterates its full adherence to the resolutions stemming from that machinery.103.	In this context  our Government wishes to recall in this international forum the arbitration decision handed down by Her Britannic Majesty on 2 May 1977  which brought to an end our dispute with Argentina with respect to borders in the southern area of our countries-a dispute which had lasted far too long. Our country can now proudly display to world public opinion this example of the implementation of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations  and declares that it will fully respect the terms of that decision.104.	My delegation is pleased to note that the Caribbean countries have brought to the American community rich and varied cultural and economic values which will certainly make a valuable contribution to the task of finding appropriate solutions to our common problems. Chile wishes to maintain with all those countries a fruitful and imaginative understanding  which  while acknowledging the identity of one and all  will still permit joint efforts and mutual assistance in our search for a common destiny.105.	The President of Chile accepted the invitation en- tended to him by the Presidents of the United States and Panama and participated in the ceremony of the signing of the Panama Canal treaties held at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington  D.C.  on 7 September 1977. The same day  consistent with his previous stand  our President signed the Declaration of Washington  which expressed the satisfaction of the American States at the signature by the Presidents of the United States and Panama of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty and the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.106.	Like the other States on the western coast of the American continent  we are especially concerned about the security and efficient operation of  and the collection of fair tolls on  that waterway  for through it passes an important part of our trade with the United States and Europe.107.	As to Belize  Chile is following closely the current negotiations between Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We hope that the distinguished negotiators will succeed in finding a mutually satisfactory formula reconciling the interests of the population with Guatemala's unquestionable rights in that area.108.	Consistent with its peace-loving tradition and its permanent quest for the rule of law and consensus in international relations  Chile views with concern the existence of an abnormal situation in various areas.109.	My Government hopes that the problems prevailing in the Korean peninsula will find a peaceful solution within a framework of peace  legality and consensus. An important step towards this objective would be the admission to this world Organization of both parties directly involved.110.	The situation in the Middle East is of special concern to us. Not only is peace in the region threatened  but also  due to the position assumed by the great Powers  there is a threat to world peace. Should a new conflict break out in the area  it would be very difficult to contain.111.	On previous occasions we have set forth our Government's views on this matter. In our view  it is essential that Israel withdraw its forces from the Arab territories it has been occupying since 1967  subject to the establishment of mutually acceptable boundaries. It is also necessary to recognize the right of all States in the region—and consequently of Israel—to live within secure and guaranteed boundaries. Moreover  the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland must also be recognized. Only on these conditions  which do not have an order of priority and must be accepted as parts of a whole  will it become possible to achieve the peace aspired to by all inhabitants of the region. That is why we view with concern the illegal  unilateral actions taking place in the occupied territories.112.	We hope that the Peace Conference on the Middle East to be convened in Geneva will be fully successful. The Palestinian people must be legitimately represented there  since their interests will be the main subject of discussion.113.	The Chilean Government has repeatedly expressed interest in a closer relationship with the African nations as a means of recognizing the numerous elements of identity existing between our peoples. Indeed  there are many reasons for our closeness to the countries of Africa: our common status as developing countries and producers of raw materials  the similarity of our essential ideological beliefs in such matters as self-determination  the equality of human beings  and finally freedom  in the sense of the term.114.	Ever since African States gained independence  Chile has given them understanding and support in the various stages of the struggle to achieve their legitimate rights. Thus  when the Organization of African Unity was born at the beginning of the last decade  our country offered it our co-operation. The same can be said of the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in which Chile has participated actively and has made its contribution to the cause of freedom and justice.115.	We hope that the difficult situation in Rhodesia will soon find a peaceful solution that will enable a gradual accession to majority rule without anarchy and without economic setbacks.116.	Chile also declares its support for the people of Namibia in the just struggle for their legitimate right to rule their own Territory  within the framework of a peaceful and orderly transition to their assumption of power.117.	We reiterate once again our firm rejection of all forms of racism or racial discrimination.118.	The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was concluded on 15 July. Remarkable progress was achieved in its important work since its session in Caracas in 1974  and in which my country has participated actively.119.	We have noted with satisfaction the international community's acceptance of the principle of an economic zone of 200 nautical miles  which was proposed unilaterally by my country 30 years ago  and jointly with Peru and Ecuador some five years later in the well-known Santiago Decoration on the Maritime Zone of 18 August 1952.120.	The signing of the Treaty on Antarctica in Washington  D.C. in 1959 may be mentioned as an example of positive achievement in matters of international cooperation. The signatory States declared Antarctica a peaceful and nuclear free zone  devoted entirely to scientific research. The provisions and the spirit of that treaty have enabled that continent so far to remain a privileged region in the world.121.	Our country  whose sovereignty over the Antarctic between longitude 53° and 90° west is based on indisputable historical  legal and geographical rights  reaffirms its decision to continue its campaign to keep the Antarctic free from pollution and to prevent any change in its present condition and ecological systems.122.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  a number of efforts have been made to introduce political considerations into the decision-making process of international and regional financial institutions. In no way can we accept any impairment of the objectives for which those institutions were created  lest we turn them into political forums  which would soon render them inoperative.123.	The latest General Assembly of the OAS adopted a position in this matter when it declared that these bodies must act in accordance with their charters and with objective criteria. We firmly repeat at this time that statement by the OAS in the conviction that it is a contribution to international peace and development.124.	The Government of Chile supports detente because it believes that it is a means of lessening international tension and because  to the extent that it is applied in good faith  it dispels the threat of world conflict.125.	Nevertheless - we feel that  for the process of detente to be valid  it should be extended to all nations. Only then will its ultimate aim  the maintenance of peace  become real and effective and correspond to the moral desire of mankind.126.	Referring to human rights and terrorism  at the seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS  held in Grenada from 14 to 22 June 1977  we expressed  together with other nations  our concern for human rights  which has merited the attention of America and States Members of this world Organization. In analysing the causes and circumstances which have led some countries to restrict certain human rights  we must realize that one of the main causes for such action is the planned and concerted subversive and terrorist activities at present devastating the lands and cities of the Americas.127.	How deceptive it is to say that it is hunger and injustice that cause terrorism. The real truth is that it is neither the poor nor the working sectors who inspire and plot terrorist violence. This is to be found  financed by foreign money and weapons  among frustrated and resentful individuals who have wasted all their opportunities in life.128.	In referring to subversive terrorism  we do not mean isolated or unrelated acts of violence  which have existed throughout history. The terrorism which is of concern to us is that which has the political and ideological aim of planned subversion of the democratic order throughout the world.129.	Therefore  we believe that it is essential for competent international organizations  when studying the situation on human rights in a given country  to attempt to verify the extent to which international subversion and terrorism have caused restrictions of certain freedoms and rights. It is necessary to have courage to single out and tackle the causes  so that once and for all subversion  terrorism and repression may be eliminated.130.	The concern necessitated by the equity and objectivity with which the bodies undertaking these studies must act must lead to judgements which will take that factor into account and to studies end measures conducive to the condemnation and eradication of subversive terrorist action as a direct and indirect factor of respect for human rights.131.	The United Nations  which was created to bring peace and brotherhood to the world  cannot remain silent in this chaotic and generalized situation. To remain passive would be tantamount to accepting a role of complicity and would make many lose faith in the legal and ethical effectiveness of this world Organization.132.	In the specific field of human rights  any investigation of alleged violations by a nation entails interference in its affairs and acquires features which make it very similar to a trial  for it becomes a matter of investigating facts that were assumed to have occurred on the sovereign territory of a given nation with a view to obtaining proofs for the purpose of evaluating those facts.133.	It seems  therefore  that in the light of natural equity applied at the international level  the need for due process becomes clear. Due process means the intervention of a body which in its origin and action would be independent of political interests  would have come into being prior to the trial  would have universal competence and  at the same time  would have a pre-established procedure that would ensure the impartiality of the international inquiry  the certainty of the proof and a real possibility for the nation accused to defend itself.134.	In the present state of our international juridical situation  only two achievements may be mentioned in the field of the requirements of justice: that which governs the European Community  and that contained in the Costa Rica Pact  which is now in the process of ratification.135.	Within the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is substantive law which is not given adequate jurisdictional implementation  nor is it in keeping with the procedural requirements inherent in due process.136.	All of those reasons led Chile to submit to the thirtieth session of the General Assembly a draft resolution proposing the study of ways and means within the United Nations system for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms  so that the measures adopted in this field under the competence of this Organization should be universally applied and binding on all Member States  obviating conflicting competencies and giving the States investigated the appropriate guarantees under due process.137.	In spite of showing genuine respect for human rights  the Chilean Government continues to be the victim of singular attack in this field in which no recognition has been shown of its commendable moderation exercised during the emergency.138.	Certain political leaders have been devoting themselves from afar to judging Chile and to proposing actions detrimental to it. As far as my country is concerned  by tradition and its personality  it is strengthened by adversity  and now more than ever we look forward to the future with renewed faith and hope.139.	There are other Western leaders who  differing ideologically with the present Chilean process  have nevertheless been able freely to visit my country and to see for themselves how false is the portrayal that some interested sectors are attempting to give with respect to Chile before international public opinion.140.	We reiterate before this international forum our readiness to receive the representatives of all friendly countries to come and witness with their own eyes how Chile  through the efforts of its sons and daughters  strives in peace to achieve its national destiny.141.	Chile accepts and recognizes international jurisdiction with respect to fundamental human rights  but  along with the best jurists  we affirm that with respect to their implementation and the individual interpretation by each people of the exercise of political  civil  economic and social rights  internal jurisdiction prevails. This individual competence not only derives from national sovereignty but is at the same time an elementary and logical consequence of the principle of self-determination of peoples. The rights of the human being  the rights of the national community and the rights of international society should all be concerted under the guidance of international law  inspired by natural law.142.	This political interrelationship and respect has been and will be the prerequisite for the existence and survival of the best form of expression heretofore known to the international community  that is  the United Nations."
"24",1297,"CHN",32,1977,"﻿94.	 Mr. President  I would like to begin my speech by congratulating you  Mr. Lazar Mojsov  on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend warm congratulations to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which has made a major contribution to the anti-imperialist cause of the people of the world  and to the Republic of Djibouti  which has won independence after waging a protracted struggle  on their admission to membership in the United Nations  and sincerely to wish them new successes along their road of advance.95.	The delegation of the People's Republic of China has come to attend this session of the General Assembly shortly after the successful Eleventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Our country is now at an important juncture in history  when we are carrying forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future. Here I would like first of all to speak on developments in China.96.	The year 1976 was no ordinary one for China. We lost our great leader and teacher Chairman Mao Tsedung and his long-tested  close comrades-in-arms  our respected and beloved Premier Chou En-lai and Chairman Chu Teh of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Their passing away was a loss beyond measure to our Party and country  and our entire people was plunged in immense grief. In the same year  our country was hit by earthquakes and other severe natural calamities. Just when our people were faced with these grave difficulties  the counterrevolutionary  gang of four  of Wang Hungwen  Chang Chun-chiao  Chiang Ching and Yao Wen-yuan frenziedly stepped up their conspiratorial activities in a vain attempt to usurp supreme leadership in our Party and State. For a time dark clouds hung heavily over China. The Chinese people were worried about the fate of our Party and country  about whether we could continue to advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao. Our friends abroad also felt anxiety for us. A handful of enemies at home and abroad  however  gloated over our difficulties and hoped that our country would henceforth be thrown into a state of chaos and division and that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and policies would no longer be followed. When Chairman Mao was still with us  he had been aware of die gang of four  problem. He waged repeated struggles against those persons and personally chose Chairman Hua Kuo-feng to be his successor so as to forestall their usurpation of Party and state power. After he passed away and at the critical moment when the  gang of four  attempted to seize the chance to take action  the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Hua followed Chairman Mao's behest  acted on his directives and decisions and smashed this cabal at one blow  thus saving our country from a blood-bath and a major retrogression. The long-steeled Communist Party and people of China stood the rigorous test and won a great victory. The Chinese people rejoiced  and our foreign friends were happy for ourS3K6.97.	At present  the situation in China is excellent We again have a wise leader in Chairman Hua Kuo-feng Our Party is more united  more unified and stronger than ever. People s democracy in China is being given full play. Our people s enthusiasm for socialism has never been so high the dictatorship of the proletariat is more firmly consolidated The mass movement to expose and criticize thegang of four has speeded up the rehabilitation and expansion of industrial and agricultural production. A new leap forward is taking shape in the national economy98.	The Eleventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China was a great milestone in the history of our Party  and it was a congress of great  historic significance and far-reaching influence. The Congress stressed that the banner of Chairman Mao is the banner of victory of the Chinese people's revolution. The Chinese people are determined to rally closely around the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Hua  forever hold aloft the great banner of Chairman Mao  adhere to his theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat  and steadfastly implement his revolutionary line in domestic and external work. We are determined to work hard for the realization of the strategic decision of grasping the key link of class struggle and bringing about great order across the land  turn China into a powerful modern socialist country by the end of the century and make a greater contribution to humanity. We are confident of surmounting all difficulties and obstacles on our road of advance. Our cause is just. Our line is correct. Our goal must be attained. Our goal can unquestionably be attained.99.	We are happy to see that the international situation is also excellent. All the basic contradictions in the world are sharpening  and the factors for revolution continue to grow. Countries want independence  nations want liberation  and the people want revolution-this has become the irresistible historical trend. The international united front against hegemonism  against the super-Power policies of aggression and war  is broadening.100.	Over the past year  the revolutionary struggle of the international proletariat  the liberation struggles of the oppressed people and nations and the revolutionary mass movements in many countries have continued to surge forward. The Korean people's struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country has won more popular support. The people of Democratic Kampuchea  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic  after winning great victories in their war against United States aggression and for national salvation  are actively consolidating their victorious gains and working hard for their countries' reconstruction. The people of the South-East Asian and South Asian countries  upholding independence and sovereignty  have repeatedly frustrated super-Power schemes of interference  control and expansion. The  Asian collective security system  so energetically hawked by a super-Power has been rejected or opposed by virtually all Asian countries. The Arab and Palestinian people's struggle against Israeli Zionism and super-Power hegemonism is deepening. The people in southern Africa have risen in a new upsurge of the struggle against colonialism and racism. The people of Panama  with the support of the people in other Latin American countries  have achieved important results in their struggle for the recovery of the Panama canal. The people of the countries of Asia  Africa  Latin America and Oceania have won a number of new victories in their struggle to win or safeguard national independence and defend state sovereignty. The numerous developing countries have carried on an unremitting struggle against the super-Powers in order to establish a new international economic order and defend their national economic rights and interests and their maritime rights. The third-world countries and people  who support and encourage one another and fight in unity and co-operation  have played an increasingly remarkable role as the main force in the struggle against imperialism  colonialism and hegemonism. Faced with the growing superpower menace  the countries of the second world in Western Europe and other regions have shown a stronger tendency towards unity against hegemonism. The mass movement of the Japanese people for the recovery of the four northern islands is sweeping across the land. The two super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  which stand opposed to the people of the world  are beset with difficulties and crises at home and abroad. They find the going tougher and tougher. Social-imperialism  in particular  has suffered heavy blows one after another as its aggressive and expansionist features are further revealed. The international situation as a whole continues to develop in a direction favourable to the people of all countries and unfavourable to the super-Powers.101.	The situation in the Middle East is a question of concern to the entire world. During the past year  the Arab and Palestinian' people have more closely combined their struggle against Zionism with the struggle against superpower hegemonism. Social-imperialism's despicable practice of betrayal and control  under the camouflage of support and aid has been opposed by a growing number of Arab countries and peoples.102.	The Egyptian Government and people have resolutely resisted social-imperialism's political blackmail and economic pressure and safeguarded their state sovereignty and national dignity. The eighth meeting of the Kings and Presidents of the Arab League  held at Cairo on 25 and 26 October 1976  reached agreement on ending the civil war in Lebanon and strengthening Arab unity  thus frustrating another attempt of the super-Powers to sow discord and split the Arab ranks. While each super-Power tries to out-clamour the other for an over-all settlement of the Middle East question  both of them are in fact still attempting to maintain the unsettled state of  no war  no peace  in the Middle East. They are afraid of the emergence of a strong and united Arab world  of a stable and prosperous Middle East. Driven by the needs of their respective global strategies  they both seek to control the Middle East. Using different ways and tactics  both of them are supporting and abetting the Israeli Zionists and bringing all kinds of pressure to bear on the Arab countries and the Palestinian people. That is why the Israeli Zionists are so obdurate and so insolent. The situation in the Middle East will remain tense and complicated  pregnant with the danger of new military conflicts. But no one can shake the resolve of the Arab and Palestinian people to recover their sacred territories and regain their national rights. Supported by the people of the whole world  the just struggle of the Arab and Palestinian people will be crowned with final victory.102. The developments in Africa are particularly encouraging. New victories have been won steadily by the great African people in their struggle against imperialism  colonialism  racism and hegemonism. The Government and people of the Sudan foiled the subversive plots engineered by social-imperialism and expelled its military experts  dealing a heavy blow to its ambition of aggression and expansion. The people of Zaire  who are united as one against the common enemy and are supported by fraternal African peoples  crushed the invasion of mercenary troops instigated by social-imperialism and safeguarded the independence and territorial integrity of their country. This victory  which greatly raised the morale of the African people and deflated the arrogance of the aggressors  sets an example of mutual support and joint resistance of African peoples against super-Power aggression. In southern Africa  the people of Zimbabwe and Namibia have persisted in armed struggle against racism and for national liberation under arduous and complex conditions. The people of Azania have fought resolutely against apartheid despite brutal repression  and the mass movement there keeps surging forward. People across the African continent voice strong solidarity for their brothers in southern Africa  whose heroic struggle also enjoys support from the people the world over. The reactionary Vorster and Smith regimes are besieged on all sides and completely isolated.103.	In their protracted struggle  the African countries and people have come to appreciate more and more the importance of unity against the enemy. Although there exist differences of one kind or another between African countries  yet confronted with the enemy they have sought common ground on major issues  while putting aside their minor differences  and have directed the main thrust of their attack against imperialism  colonialism and racism  and super-Power hegemonism in particular. This has been and will continue to be an important guarantee for the victories of the African people. The first Afro-Arab summit conference and the fourteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity stressed mutual aid and co-operation and the need to oppose foreign interference. These Conferences were a significant testimony to the strength and unity of the 61 African and Arab countries with their more than 400 million people in lighting the common enemy. They were a positive contribution to the struggle of the African and Arab people and of the entire third world against imperialism  colonialism and hegemonism.104.	The struggle of the African people will yet be protracted and arduous. Colonialism and racism are still putting up a last-ditch struggle. What is more serious is that both super-Powers have intensified their interference in African affairs. Owing to the importance of Africa's strategic location and its rich natural resources  each of them regards the control of this continent as an important part of its global strategy of gaining sway in Europe and dominating the world. Super-Power rivalry in Africa is becoming fiercer. One super-Power seeks to preserve and expand its vested interests and influence in Africa. It obdurately supports the forces of colonialism and racism in southern Africa and tries to undermine the liberation struggles of the people there. The other super-Power  flaunting the banner of opposing imperialism and colonialism and supporting the national liberation movement to fool people  has stepped up its infiltration and expansion in Africa. It is exploiting some differences between African countries and between liberation organizations and utilizing some problems left over from the days of colonial rule to sow discord  incite trouble and fish in troubled waters. Against those African countries which dare to resist and oppose its hegemonic behaviour  this super-Power has resorted to brazen and unscrupulous subversion and interference and gone so far as to organize and send mercenary troops for outright military invasion  which poses a grave threat to the security and independence of these countries. Many African countries are worried lest what happened in Angola and Zaire yesterday may befall themselves tomorrow. Facts eloquently show that the rivalry between the super-Powers is the main source of unrest and turbulence in Africa  and that the super-Power which styles itself a  natural ally  of the African people has become their most sinister and ferocious enemy. The African countries and people are indeed faced with the trying task of rebuffing the tiger at the back door while repelling the wolf at the front gate . However  a great change has taken place in Africa. The great African people have stood up; they will never tolerate any foreign force of aggression lording it over them again. It is our conviction that the African people  persisting in unity and struggle against the common enemy  will frustrate all super-Power schemes and demolish the last bastions of colonialism and racism in Africa  thereby winning complete independence and liberation for the whole of Africa.105.	A question the people of the world are interested in and think about today is whether the world situation is more tense or more relaxed  whether the danger of war is greater or less. A super-Power claims that the danger of war has been  considerably reduced . This is sheer deceptive talk. The stark reality is that the situation in the world has not relaxed  and that the factors for war are visibly growing. In their scramble for hegemony  both superpowers are intensifying their arms expansion and war preparations. Their rivalry extends to every corner of the world. They are carrying out aggression and expansion far and wide  each cutting the ground from under the other's feet and striving to weaken and gain advantage over the other. Because of its political  economic and strategic importance  Europe is strategically the focus of rivalry between the two hegemonic Powers and the arena where they are locked in acute military confrontation. The two antagonistic military blocs keep increasing their troops and armaments and redeploying their forces and frequently conducting large-scale military exercises. The war machine of each super-Power has expanded to unprecedented proportions. The super-Powers are the source of a new world war. This is an ironclad fact which no one can cover up.106.	It must be pointed out in particular that social- imperialism presents the greater danger. Judging from the current over-all picture of the rivalry between the two hegemonic Powers  the United States is on the defensive  while the Soviet Union is on the offensive. Social- imperialism is exerting its utmost to carry out all-round arms expansion. It surpassed the United States in conventional armed forces long ago and is striving for over-all supremacy in nuclear weapons as well. It has expanded its navy on a massive scale  and its fleets are active on all seas. It wants to grab the whole of Europe  Asia and Africa. It not only maintains a posture of readiness to break through at the centre in Europe  but strives to create a situation in which it can outflank Europe from the north and the south. It is accelerating its plunder of strategic resources and control of strategic areas in Africa and the Middle East and seeks to seize the Persian Gulf in the east  block the strategic routes of the Atlantic Ocean in the west and thrust round the Cape of Good Hope in the south. The ambitions of the new tsars far exceed those of the old tsars.107.	There are profound political and economic reasons why social-imperialism has become the most dangerous source of war. Being a latecomer among the imperialist Powers  it is more aggressive and adventurous. Owing to its relatively inadequate economic strength  it cannot but rely to a greater extent on military strength and threats of war in pursuing expansion. Its highly concentrated State- monopoly capitalist economy and its political regime of Fascist dictatorship make it easier to militarize its national economy and state apparatus. Besides  it flaunts the banner of  socialism   which can deceive people to a certain extent  and this also makes it more dangerous.108.	Lenin said:  An essential feature of imperialism is the rivalry between several great Powers in the striving for hegemony. 109.	Chairman Mao said: The United States wants to protect its interests in the world and the Soviet Union wants to expand; this can in no way be changed. In the era in which classes exist  war is an interval between one peace and another. War is a continuation of politics  that is to say  a continuation of peace. Peace itself is politics. The continuation of fierce contention between the two super-Powers is bound to lead to a world war some day. This is independent of man's will.110.	More and more people have recognized that the factors for war are visibly growing and that social- imperialism is the most dangerous source of war. They advocate the strengthening of unity  of defence capabilities and of preparedness against war. But it must not be overlooked that there is still a strong trend towards appeasement in the West. Some people hope that .temporary ease can be gained by making compromises and concessions. They imagine that they can restrain social- imperialism by signing agreements and expanding economic exchanges with it and by giving it loans. Some even seek to divert this peril towards the east in order to preserve themselves at the expense of others. Historical experience tells us that all aggressors bully the soft and fear the tough and always reach out for a yard after taking an inch. Like rearing a tiger to one's ultimate detriment  a policy of appeasement will simply encourage aggression and hasten the outbreak of war. To follow in Neville Chamberlain's footsteps means courting self-destruction. We must not forget the tragic lesson of Munich.111.	It is understandable that people are interested in the question of disarmament when the super-Powers are stepping up their rivalry and their arms expansion and war preparations and when the danger of a world war is growing. But the super-Powers are playing up disarmament as something miraculous. In particular  the super-Power that most vociferously preaches  peace  dishes up some sort of disarmament proposal every year and describes disarmament virtually as a panacea which will dispel the danger of war  ensure a lasting peace and rid the world of poverty. This is sheer deception. Since the super-Powers are bent on aggression and expansion and are scrambling for world hegemony  they are bound to expand their armaments and go to war. They will never lay down their knives  nor beat their swords into ploughshares. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva has been going on for 16 years  yet neither super-Power has reduced its armaments by a single gun. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have been going on for 8 years  yet strategic arms have kept growing in number. The negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Central Europe has entered its fourth year  yet the armaments deployed by the super-Powers in central Europe have continued to increase  and there are endless wrangling and differences even over the exact number of troops maintained by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty in this region. It is very clear that the super-Powers are prating about disarmament and peace only to cover up their arms expansion and war preparations. They are just using people's desire for peace to lull the people with false hopes so that it may be easier for them to launch a war some day and realize their wild ambition of conquering the world.112. Our attitude with regard to a world war is   First  we are against it; second  we are not afraid of it . The people of the world want peace  and the Chinese people also want a peaceful international environment in which they may better build up their country. It is the super-Powers and not the Chinese people and the people of the world who want war. Some people say that in repeatedly stressing the danger of a world war  China is raising a false alarm and that it is warlike and wants to provoke a world war. This is vile slander. All we have done is to call a spade a spade so that the people will be on the alert and oppose the unleashing of a new world war by the super-Powers. And when we say we are not afraid of war  it means still less that we like it  but because to be afraid gets us nowhere. The super-Powers are bent on fighting a war. What is the use of being afraid? Actually  the super-Powers are not so terrifying. They look strong like real tigers. But  as Chairman Mao pointed out: ... imperialism and all reactionaries  looked at in essence  from a long-term point of view  from a strategic point of view  must be seen for what they are—paper tigers.   sSocial-imperialism has wild ambitions. But it finds little political support  and its economy is lop-sided. There is a sharpening contradiction between its ruling clique and the broad masses as well as mounting discontent among the oppressed minority nationalities at home. Its  community   which is a colonial set-up  is very unstable and shows a growing centrifugal tendency. Pursuing aggression and expansion everywhere  social-imperialism has set itself against the people of all countries  and this in itself dooms it to defeat. So long as the people of all countries unite and form themselves into a mighty army against hegemonism  heighten their vigilance  get prepared and persevere in struggle  they may be able to put off the war; and in case it does break out  they will find themselves in a favourableposition to abolish unjust war by means of a just war against aggression and win genuine peace. We are revolutionary optimists. We are convinced that the human race will abolish war and not be destroyed by it.113. Developments on the international scene have proved that Chairman Mao's thesis differentiating the three worlds  which he set forth in 1974  conforms to the political realities of the contemporary world and is in the fundamental interests of the people the world over. Back in 1926 he stressed  Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution. Chairman Mao advanced his thesis differentiating the three worlds after he had observed and studied for years the development and changes of the basic contradictions and the division and realignment of the political forces in the world since the 1960s  as well as the political and economic position of each country internationally. The great significance of this thesis lies in the fact that it provides the people of the world with a powerful ideological instrument with which to identify the main revolutionary forces  the chief enemies  and the middle forces that can be won over and united within the international struggle of today. It thus enables the people of all countries to mobilize better all positive factors  unite with all the forces that can be united and isolate the main common enemy to the maximum and deal it the heaviest blows. At present  the steady reinforcement of the unity and co-operation of the third world  the growing tendency in the second world to unity against hegemonism and the broadening of the international united front against super-Power hegemonism  in which the third world is the main force-all this testifies to the validity of Chairman Mao's thesis. Obviously  the broader the international united front against hegemonism and the more isolated the super-Powers  the more that situation will favour the struggle of the oppressed people and nations for liberation and of the people of all countries  particularly the third-world countries  to win or safeguard national independence  defend State sovereignty and develop their national economy. On the other hand  every victory in the revolutionary struggle of the people of all countries helps to weaken the super-Powers  thwart their aggressive and expansionist ambitions  upset their war plans and deployments  and put off the outbreak of a new world war.114. Chairman Mao's theory of the three worlds is diametrically opposed to the super-Powers' views on international relations. One super-Power spreads the view that there is only one world  a so-called  interdependent  world. But in fact the different parts of the world are mutually contradictory as well as interrelated. The  interdependence  this super-Power emphasizes has nothing in common with the international co-operation on an equal footing demanded by the many small and medium-sized countries. This super-Power wants to obliterate the actual contradiction between exploiter and exploited  between oppressor and oppressed and between aggressor and victim of aggression. It attempts thereby to preserve the outdated world order and wants all countries to be  dependent  on it. The other super-Power ignores the fact that the socialist camp ceased to exist and the imperialist camp disintegrated long ago  and asserts that the two camps still exist. Evidently  it wants even more to obliterate its acute contradiction with the people of the world  and with the people of the third-world countries  in particular. By continuing to use the signboard  the socialist camp   it attempts to disguise its true nature of social-imperialism  enforce the doctrines of  limited sovereignty  and  international dictatorship  in its  community  so as to preserve its neo-colonial set-up  and at the same time to hoodwink the people and to push its policies of aggression and expansion in the whole world. There is an essential similarity between the two views advanced by the two super-Powers. Both want to prevent us the people of the world from distinguishing between our enemies  our friends and ourselves  so as to strengthen their positions in the rivalry for world hegemony and to undermine the struggle of the world people against hegemonism.115.	Chairman Mao's strategic concept differentiating the three worlds explodes the fallacies spread by the superpowers and gives a correct orientation to the contemporary international struggle. This brilliant concept will demonstrate greater vitality with the passage of time.116.	The revolutionary line and policies in foreign affairs which were formulated by the Chinese people's great leader and teacher Chairman Mao Tsetung and creatively implemented by our esteemed and beloved Premier Chou En-lai have been and will continue to be the guideline for China's external work. At the Eleventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China  Chairman Hua Kuo-feng solemnly declared that we will hold high the great banner of Chairman Mao  adhere to proletarian internationalism and continue to carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in foreign affairs. We will strengthen our unity with the other socialist countries and with the proletariat and the oppressed people and nations throughout the world  strengthen our unity with the other third-world countries and ally with all countries subjected to the aggression  interference or threats of super-Power hegemonism so as to form the broadest possible united front against the hegemonism of the two super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States. We will establish and develop relations with other countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We will strengthen our unity with all other genuine Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations and carry through to the end the struggle against modern revisionism with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique as its centre.117.	We have always held that all countries  big and small  should be equal. We are resolutely against big nations bullying small ones and strong nations oppressing weak ones. The affairs of a country should be managed by its own people; the affairs of a region should be managed by the countries in that region; the affairs of the whole world should be managed jointly by all countries.118.	China is a socialist country. China and the other third-world countries share a common experience and face common fighting tasks. China belongs to the third world. We stand firmly together with the other developing countries and people in Asia  Africa  Latin America and other regions. We firmly support these countries in their struggle to combat imperialism  colonialism and hegemonism and to win or safeguard national independence  defend State sovereignty and develop their national economy. The non-aligned movement  an important force  has developed steadily and become stronger  and together with the other third-world countries  it is playing a role of growing importance in international affairs. We firmly support the non-aligned countries in pursuing their non- aligned policy of independence  peace and neutrality and support them in opposing all foreign aggression and interference.119.	We firmly support the Korean people in their just struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country. The United Nations Command must be dissolved. The armed forces of the United States and their equipment must be withdrawn immediately and totally from South Korea. The Chung Hee Park clique in South Korea must stop all its provocations which create tensions. The Korean question should be resolved by the Korean people themselves free from any outside interference. Any act to delay and obstruct the reunification of Korea in the hope of perpetuating the division of Korea and creating  two Koreas  runs counter to the aspirations of the entire Korean people and will not be tolerated. The resolution for promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its thirtieth session should be implemented in earnest.120.	We firmly support the Arab and Palestinian people in their just struggle to recover their lost territories and regain their national rights. We are firmly opposed to the rivalry for hegemony between the two super-Powers in the Middle East and to Israel's policy of aggression. The provocative action of the present administration of Israel in establishing settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan River with a view to permanently occupying Arab territories must be strongly condemned. We reaffirm that we will have no dealings whatsoever with the Israeli Zionists.121.	We firmly support the people of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania in their just struggle against white racism and for national independence and liberation. We reaffirm that we will have no dealings whatsoever with the South African and Rhodesian racist regimes.122.	We firmly support the Latin American countries in their struggle to strengthen unity and co-operation and combat super-Power hegemonism. We firmly support the Panamanian people in their valiant and protracted struggle for the recovery of the Panama Canal.123.	We firmly support the third-world countries and people in their struggle against imperialist or social- imperialist exploitation and plunder  for the establishment of a new international economic order and in defence of their national economic rights and interests. The correct principles in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Programme of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly must be carried out. We support the series of reasonable proposals advanced by the developing countries  such as the establishment of an integrated programme for commodities and its common fund  the demand for a moratorium on and the reduction or cancellation of debt burdens  etc.124.	We support the second-world countries and people in their struggle to oppose super-Power control  intimidation and bullying and to defend their security and national independence. We support their efforts to improve relations with third-world countries on the basis of equality. We appreciate the efforts of the Western European countries for unity against hegemonism. We firmly support the Japanese people in their struggle for the recovery of the four northern islands.125.	We are for genuine disarmament and against sham disarmament. We have consistently stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. As the first step  all nuclear countries  and particularly the two nuclear super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that they will not be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time or in any circumstances  and in particular will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones  and that they must dismantle all their nuclear bases on the territories of other countries and withdraw from abroad all their nuclear armed forces and nuclear weapons. We support the demands of the countries and people in the regions of the Indian Ocean  the  Mediterranean and the Red Sea and in South-East Asia  South Asia and Latin America for the establishment of peace zones  security zones and nuclear-free zones. We are strongly opposed to the super-Powers' policies of nuclear blackmail and nuclear monopoly and to their disarmament fraud.126.	The Shanghai communiqué of 27 February 1972 is the basis for the relations between China and the United States at present. According to the spirit of the communiqué  if relations between the two countries are to be normalized  the United States must sever its so-called diplomatic relations with the Chiang clique  withdraw all its armed forces and military installations from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area and abrogate its so-called  mutual defence treaty  with the Chiang clique. Taiwan is China's sacred territory. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and accomplish the great undertaking of unifying our motherland. When and how to liberate Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair  which brooks no foreign interference whatsoever. The above is the unalterable stand of the Chinese Government.127.	Our controversy with the Soviet leading clique on matters of principle will go on for a long time. We will persevere in our tit-for-tat struggle against its hegemonism. At the same time  we have always held that China and the Soviet Union should maintain normal State relations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. It is none other than the Soviet leading clique that has worsened the State relations between China and the Soviet Union. If the Soviet leaders really want to improve the State relations between the two countries  they should prove this by deeds.128.	We will always bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching   Dig tunnels deep  store grain everywhere  and never seek hegemony   and be ready at all times to wipe out any enemy that dares to invade China. Our policy is:  We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked  we will certainly counterattack. 129.	We will always bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching that in our external work we should  get rid of great-power chauvinism resolutely  thoroughly  wholly and completely  We will never seek hegemony or be superpower. We will always stand by the oppressed people and nations throughout the world. On behalf of the Chinese Government  Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-ping solemnly declared from this rostrum in April 1974: If one day China should change its [political] colour and turn into a super-Power  if it too  should play the tyrant in the world  and everywhere subject others to its bullying  aggression and exploitation  then the people of the world should identify it as social imperialism  expose it  oppose it and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it. Here  we the Chinese delegation  would like to reaffirm this stand.130.	The world is advancing amidst turmoil; the people are awakening in the course of struggle. We are now in a new historical period-a period of struggle against superpower hegemonism. The struggle will be hard and the road tortuous  but the future is bright.  The people  and the people alone  are the motive force in the making of world history. The people of the world have been tempered in great storms of struggle. They have gained experience  strengthened their unity and grown stronger. It is not the one or two super-Powers but the people of the world that decide the destiny of mankind. Victory unquestionably belongs to the people of the world. "
"25",1340,"CIV",32,1977,"﻿100.	Those of us who have had the privilege and pleasure of knowing and working with you  Sir  for many years when you represented your country in the United Nations cannot but rejoice at your accession to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is therefore with great pleasure that I join those speakers who preceded me at this rostrum to convey to you my most sincere and cordial congratulations on the occasion of your election.101.	Your election is a well-deserved tribute paid not only to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman with wide and rich experience of international relations and a profound knowledge of the United Nations  designated quite naturally for this important function  but also to Yugoslavia  your country  and more particularly its distinguished Head of State  Marshal Tito  for their enormous contribution to the cause of peace and international security and peaceful coexistence among peoples of different origins and conditions. You may rest assured that  in the exercise of your functions  you can always rely on the full co-operation of the delegation of the Ivory Coast.102.	I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to associate myself with the tributes paid to Mr. Amerasinghe  your predecessor  and tell him how greatly we appreciated the remarkable manner in which he presided over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.103.	The dynamism  the courage  the acute sense of duty and untiring dedication shown by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  during his first term of office in the service of the international community fully justified the wise decision taken by the Assembly last year to re-elect him to his high office. The Ivory Coast  its Government and people welcome that decision and wish to assure him once again of their full support of his efforts in favour of international peace and security.104.	I should like finally to address my sincere congratulations  and to extend a warm welcome  to two new Members of our Organization: The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. We wish to let their representatives know that we are ready to co-operate with them within the framework of the United Nations and to maintain friendly relations with their two countries.105.	The independence and admission of the Republic of Djibouti to the United Nations marks the end of French colonization in Africa. This affords us an opportunity again to pay a sincere tribute to France on its decolonization endeavours  which have enabled almost 20 African States  today masters of their destiny  to make their modest contributions to building that peace to which the whole of mankind aspires. But we would not be sincere if we did not say-that that remarkable task would remain incomplete so long as France  together with the Republic of the Comoros  has not found a solution allowing for the peaceful reintegration of Mayotte Island into the Comorean group  thus enabling the Republic of the Comoros to recover its unity and territorial integrity. For our part  we place our confidence in France and the Comoros  two friendly countries to which we are bound by so many ties  and we are certain that they will settle this regrettable dispute by negotiation-something that would promote fruitful cooperation between their two countries and relieve their friends.106.	In addressing members of the Economic and Social Council in Abidjan on 30 June 1976  the President of the Republic of the Ivory Coast reaffirmed:""... the fundamental principles of the internal and external policies of the Ivory Coast are its faith in the destiny and nobility of man  its constant openness to men and to all things  its unshakable faith in the virtues of peace and dialogue  and its complete readiness to cooperate in friendship with all countries.""Peace remains the basis of that policy  and its aim the well-being of man in freedom and dignity  which presupposes that his fundamental needs are met and that he can live a decent life allowing for his full development in his natural environment. Those principles guide our daily action and govern our position.107.	It is in the light of those fundamental considerations that I shall endeavour to address myself to some of the burning problems on our agenda for the current session. These problems are not new  and neither are our positions  which are well known to all.108.	At this stage I must recognize that most of the speakers who have taken part in the debate have said that the international situation is very bleak and that the world is confronted with conflicts and difficulties of every kind. In the face of the desolating spectacle of a divided world prey to the fury of war and violence  to waste of so many resources for destructive purposes  to flagrant injustices and inequalities  to serious violations of human rights  and to increasingly intolerable racial discrimination  the Ivory Coast cannot but deplore the lack of courage and political will which has prevented us  and in particular the more powerful countries  from doing everything in our power to find a satisfactory solution to such problems and thus hastening the dawn of a world of peace  justice and progress.109.	It seems as if we are resigning ourselves to our fate  as if we have become incapable of forming or putting forward creative ideas. Incapable of solving existing conflicts that endanger peace and international security  we are doing everything to stoke up existing hotbeds of war  or start new ones  and to poison the situation at a time when laudable efforts are being made to reach pacific settlement of certain situations or to break the impasse reached in others. These efforts give us grounds for hope and for viewing the future with some optimism  provided we do everything in our power to put an end to the infernal cycle of violence  while respecting human rights for all and taking advantage of the fruits of economic growth and the progress of science and technology.110.	The accession to independence of the Republic of Djibouti should not make us forget that the political situation in Africa is still of concern. White racist minorities continue to maintain their implacable domination over and subject to inhuman treatment millions of Africans in Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa  denying their right to freedom and dignity. Frontier disputes  at times leading to bloodshed  and conflicts that are fanned and maintained by certain arms merchants who take advantage of such situations to enrich themselves or to enlarge their areas of influence  pit Africans against each other.111.	Because more than any other continent it needs peace to catch up after its long delay on the road to progress  Africa  and the Ivory Coast in particular  hopes that every effort will be made to ensure the complete decolonization of the continent and the total elimination of racial discrimination in order to restore to the African his dignity and all of his rights.112.	In the face of the stubbornness of the white minorities in southern Africa and their attitude of defiance  it is said that the only solution is recourse to armed struggle. It certainly cannot be asserted that those who hold such views are wrong. For our part  although we understand their reasons  we still continue to advocate recourse to negotiation and dialogue to settle the problems of southern Africa. The initiatives taken in this respect can in no way represent an obstacle to the heroic struggle of the liberation movements; quite the contrary  they supplement them and seek to facilitate the search for a negotiated political solution  alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed peoples  and bring peace to Africa.113.	The Ivory Coast has not been slow in making its modest contribution to such initiatives. While upholding in its own way  but effectively and concretely  the struggle waged by the liberation movements  it has exhorted all those who have privileged relations with such regimes and are in a position to exert some influence over them to act to promote .the quest for a negotiated solution of the problems in the region. In the course of its direct or indirect contacts  it has informed the South African and Rhodesian leaders of the necessity and urgency of peaceful change for the transfer of power  without prior conditions  to the black majority in Zimbabwe  rapid accession to independence for Namibia and the establishment of racial equality in South Africa.114.	We are happy to note that these efforts are yielding their fruits and that the prospect of speedy accession to independence by Namibia and Zimbabwe is emerging  despite the difficulties still to be overcome.115.	We are gratified in this connexion to find that  as regards Namibia  the five Western members of the Security Council have taken the initiative of contacting the SouthAfrican authorities in order to find a way out of the Namibian deadlock and prevent South Africa from executing its plan concerning that Territory.116.	The Ivory Coast considers that the international community should not minimize the importance of such an initiative. We must therefore not only place our trust in them but encourage them to continue their negotiations with the South African authorities in order to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 385 (1976) of 30 January 1976  which defines the modalities for Namibia's accession to independence through free and democratic elections under United Nations supervision.117.	As regards Southern Rhodesia  the United Nations has just been officially seized of a series of proposals elaborated by the United Kingdom and the United States Governments in consultation with the parties concerned and aimed at restoring legality in that country and at the transfer of power to the African majority. Although these proposals give rise to some reservations  we believe that they could serve as a reasonable basis for negotiations  enabling us to achieve our common objective: the accession of the African majority to power in Zimbabwe.118.	Problems that are both difficult and complex  in particular those relating to the respect for the law and maintenance of order during the transitional period  must be solved  just as the parties concerned should agree on practical modalities for free and democratic consultations enabling the people of Zimbabwe to decide its future  establish its own institutions and elect its own leaders.119.	We regard as positive the fact that the Security Council  following a request by the United Kingdom  should have requested the Secretary-General in its resolution 415(1977) of 29 September 1977 to designate a special representative:""... to enter into discussions  with the British Resident Commissioner designate and with all the parties  concerning the military and associated arrangements that are considered necessary to effect the transition to majority rule in southern Rhodesia ..."".120.	The role assigned to the special representative of the Secretary-General  who is called upon to work in close co-operation with the British Resident Commissioner  engages the United Nations in the process of political settlement of the Rhodesian question and leads it to assume responsibilities which in no way change those of the United Kingdom  which we continue to recognize as the Administering Power in Southern Rhodesia. We hope that these two persons will benefit from the co-operation and support of all the parties concerned and of Member States in order to find a solution to the difficult problems still to be resolved.121.	It is surprising that  while the African countries which are the first concerned give their agreement to the designation of the representative of the Secretary-General  certain Powers should attempt to make us believe that Africa wishes to become the accomplice of a neo-colonialist plan to perpetuate colonialism on the African continent. Those Powers act as if the Africans were not sufficiently mature to know where their own interests lie.122.	We understand that those who have everything to gain from the perpetuation of the war in southern Africa because it favours their designs cannot easily accept the peaceful means of settlement of the problems in that region and elsewhere.123.	For 30 years the United Nations and the international community have been denouncing and condemning the heinous system of apartheid and attempting in vain  through many resolutions  to find a solution to that problem. To us  apartheid is less a question of decolonization than an interracial conflict in which the black man  economically and intellectually subjected  suffers the crushing white domination which is determined to plunder all his rights. That is why we regard apartheid as an insult to our dignity as blacks. This is enough to justify our aversion to that policy and our determination to do everything in our power to eliminate it.124.	As recalled recently in Libreville by President Houphouet-Boigny on the occasion of the fourteenth regular session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  the Ivory Coast ""has never failed on a single occasion to condemn unequivocally and unreservedly this inhuman policy and all forms of racial discrimination."" This firm condemnation of apartheid and its evils does not prevent us from hoping for its elimination through peaceful means.125.	In the contacts we have established with the South African authorities we have not failed to try to make them understand the dangers to Africa of maintaining this heinous policy which has been unanimously condemned by the international community. We have always endeavoured to convince them of the need to open a dialogue with the large black majority in order to achieve racial equality in South Africa.126.	We have no illusions that these contacts alone will lead to the changes we are requesting  but we are still convinced none the less that they do enable us to do away with mistrust  while promoting understanding and confidence  convincing the white South Africans of the uselessness of their arguments and the need to put an end to massacre and assassination  which we strongly condemn  while at the same time making it possible to bring about the changes likely to guarantee to all the African inhabitants of South Africa the same rights and obligations and the same opportunities for development. This is our conviction. We are inspired by a single concern  that of peace  which is indispensable to Africa if it is to do away with underdevelopment while restoring the dignity of all Africans.127.	This same desire for peace compels us to address a pressing and brotherly appeal to those African countries which have boundary conflicts and other differences to cease hostilities  end their quarrels and enable those bodies set up - by the OAU to contribute to the settlement of the differences  in keeping with the OAU Charter. We invite them to open negotiations under the aegis of the OAU in order to solve their disputes and restore the best possible relations of good neighbourliness.128.	Likewise  we avail ourselves of this opportunity to declare solemnly from this rostrum that if any African State believes that it has a dispute with the Ivory Coast we are ready to meet its representatives anywhere and at any time to seek out ways and means of settling that dispute  because we wish to maintain relations of friendship and trusting co-operation with all African countries without exception  and especially with our immediate neighbours.129.	The situation in the Middle East still gives rise to serious concern. Our attitude in respect of this problem has always been inspired by peace. Peace is indivisible. The peace we want for Africa we also wish for the Middle East. But that peace cannot be realized unless we resolutely tackle the very heart of the problem  that of enabling the Palestinian people to find  like all the other peoples on earth  a homeland in which they can live and develop.130.	We believe that the settlement of the Palestinian problem is the condition sine qua non for the establishment of just and durable peace in the Middle East. We rejoice at the sincere efforts deployed to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference. We fear  however  that those efforts will prove vain if the representatives of the Palestinian people are not closely associated with the negotiation process and the search for peace and if the legitimate rights of that people and other peoples in the region are not recognized by all sides.131.	Any progress in this patient quest for peace presupposes that the protagonists in the drama in the Middle East accept the fact of Israel and of Palestine; that is to say  on the one hand  that the Arabs-including the Palestinians—recognize the existence of Israel as a sovereign and independent State and its right to live within recognized and secure boundaries and  on the other hand  that Israel  for its part  recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  in particular its right to a homeland in the land of that Palestine that they all claim.132.	For our part  we reaffirm unequivocally Israel's right to existence  just as we desire the creation of a Palestinian State distinct from Israel and Jordan  without our prejudging the future and the relations that those States may in all sovereignty decide to establish among themselves. The Ivory Coast continues to believe that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974 constitute a reasonable basis for the overall settlement of the Middle East question.133.	We consider that this last resolution  which reaffirmed the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  redresses the weaknesses and the gaps in the first two resolutions. Some of its provisions would therefore gain much were they to be taken up by the Security Council to complete its resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973)  since we are all agreed that the legitimate rights of the Palestinians should be taken into account  just as these two resolutions affirm the rights of all States in the region  including those of Israel.134.	It is necessary  therefore  for Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967 and refrain from any action likely to jeopardize the peace efforts. In this connexion we feel that the recent measures taken by the Israeli Government in its territories are not likely to facilitate the settlement of the Middle East problem. This is something we deplore. It is also necessary that an end be put to the state of belligerence prevailing in the region and that the Palestinians abandon their desires to destroy the State of Israel.135.	With reference to the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the negotiation process  we believe that it would be a political error to persist in denying that organization its rights. The participation of the Palestinians in one way or another appears to us to be of the highest importance in the present circumstances. We are happy to note that the great Powers  and in particular the United States of America through its most authorized voice  should have arrived at the same conclusion  namely  that there cannot be peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinians participate in the elaboration of the modalities that should lead to peace. Any peace concluded without them is  sooner or later  bound to fail. And  it is to no one's interest that it should do so.136.	That is why we are gratified at the present development of affairs and the efforts deployed these days by all the parties concerned to devise a formula which would make it possible to overcome procedural obstacles in order to convene the Geneva Conference  where Arabs and Israelis could open useful negotiations with a view to laying the basis for their harmonious coexistence in the region.137.	We are  of course  aware ""of the complexity of the tasks ahead. But we are also certain that if all the parties  overcoming rancour and hatred  mistrust and intransigence  were determined to negotiate in good faith all aspects of the situation in the Middle East  it is not unreasonable to believe that peace could be restored in that region in so far-as the parties concerned themselves will have negotiated the conditions of that peace.138.	For its part  as President Houphouet-Boigny declared on 2 July last  in Libreville  the Ivory Coast will support any initiative  any effort and any negotiation enabling that region to devote itself at last  in peace  to the great realizations that its human wealth and economic potential enable it to envisage as soon as armed tension shall have given way to the reconciliation of peoples which a long history has condemned to live together.139.	Other hotbeds of tension continue to retain our attention. While we can congratulate ourselves at the fact that the United States and Panama should have arrived at an agreement enabling the Republic of Panama to recover in time its full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone  we cannot say the same of Cyprus where no progress has been registered in intercommunal negotiations  and where one part of the territory is still under foreign occupation. We urge the representatives of the two Cypriot communities to resume their negotiations under the aegis of the Secretary- General of the United Nations to settle this question peacefully in order to safeguard the territorial integrity  political independence and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. We consider that the United Nations resolutions on the question should be effectively implemented by all the parties concerned.140.	Despite the adoption of partial measures and the conclusion of bilateral agreements  despite lofty declarations of intention and anguished appeals for disarmament  the nuclear and conventional arms race continues inexorably  is even being accelerated and intensified  and poses to mankind more terrifying threats than ever.141.	Military expenditures in the world have grown from $270 billion in 1974 to some $350 billion in 1976; 5 to 6 per cent of the world's production of goods and services is absorbed by these expenses. What madness  what squandering in the face of the misery  the disease  the poverty  the hunger and the ignorance of a large part of the world's population! And yet  as stated by President Houphouet- Boigny:""Just a part of the sums devoted to these engines of war would suffice rapidly to return the whole of mankind everywhere on our planet to a state of dignity and give it back its joie de vivre.""142.	With this sad reality as the starting-point we associate ourselves with all who demand true  general and complete disarmament under appropriate international control  and await hopefully the special session of the General Assembly in 1978 to be devoted to that problem. We hope that the great nuclear Powers and all those who are about to become nuclear Powers or are engaging in the arms race  will assume firm and precise commitments to reverse the trend and to lead us progressively to true disarmament.143.	Following the serious economic crisis in 1973  the need for a new concept of international economic relations  founded on justice  equity and interdependence  has made itself felt. The Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations have laid the bases of those relations designed to ensure the economic and social progress of the third-world countries  to strengthen their political independence  to establish more harmonious relations among States and to guarantee the peaceful evolution of the world.144.	This structural reform of the world economy  desired and accepted by all  can only be achieved through bold decisions adopted by the international community in essential spheres such as international trade  the transfer of resources  industrialization  agricultural development and the use of science and technology. However  despite the constructive dialogue that has taken place in the United Nations and in other bodies  among different groups of countries  very meagre progress has been achieved in concrete terms with a view to establishing that new international order.145.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation held in Paris at the happy initiative of the President of the French Republic did not achieve its objective  namely  the adoption of concrete proposals for the establishment of the new international economic order and for the solution of the most pressing problems of the developing countries and the industrialized countries alike.146.	The agreements arrived at on the principle of the establishment of a common fund for the financing of buffer stocks of primary commodities  on the development of an economic and social infrastructure  particularly in Africa  and on a $1 billion programme of special action for the benefit of the least privileged countries do not authorize us to boast that we have achieved any victory because what is most important remains to be done. And what is this that still remains to be done in the developing countries?147.	First of all  measures must be taken to make international trade more balanced and therefore more favourable to the least developed among the developing countries—for instance  by the organization of markets so as to put an end to the deterioration in their terms of trade while ensuring that the developing countries derive sufficient and regular earnings from all their exports.148.	Next  there is the increase of resources allocated to the financing economic and social development of the countries of the third world  either through the channel of direct financial aid or through the reform of the international monetary system and the establishment of a new financing mechanism. The consideration of the important and delicate question of the debt burden of the developing countries  in our view  should be carried out with care and realism—realism concerning the diversity of the situation of the countries concerned-so as to avoid apparently useful and effective proposals turning against their authors by creating situations which would block the development of countries that  for a long time to come  will still need the support of foreign capital.149.	In addition  there should be rational use of science and technology in the service of development in order to achieve a new distribution of world economic activities that would take account of the interests of all the peoples of the world and preclude any harmful social repercussions.150.	Lastly  we must determine the most favourable conditions for intensifying effective economic co-operation among the developing countries themselves in order to achieve the optimal utilization of their human and material potential. The Ivory Coast believes that this co-operation among ourselves  the developing countries  which can be achieved only through successive regional approaches  will be the best illustration of our readiness to take charge of our own economic development. For its part  my country is devoting itself sincerely  actively and enthusiastically to this task in close co-operation with our neighbouring countries within the framework of agreements based on effective solidarity.151.	All the international conferences held these past years on problems of world interest  such as those of the environment  population or food  have greatly contributed to a better understanding of existing relations among peoples in all spheres of human endeavour. Never has mankind given so much collective attention to the human predicament and to the means of improving it. It would be disastrous to interrupt the positive dialogue that has been instituted between different groups of countries within the United Nations system and in other international forums.152.	We must therefore attempt  through negotiation  to find practical solutions that will fully take into account the well-understood interests of all States while bringing us closer to our objective  man's well-being.153.	But that goal cannot be fully ensured unless basic human rights are respected.154.	Particular stress has been placed of late on persistent violations of those rights committed  not only by the colonialist and racist regimes of southern Africa  but also by many Governments of States Members of this Organization. In some independent countries  torture  arbitrary trials  summary executions and deprivation of rights and freedom have become commonplace. The Ivory Coast does not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of other States  but it believes that the hypocritical attitude we adopt  too often out of complacency  encourages those violations. While we mobilize to defend the human rights violated in a particular country  we keep a guilty silence on the same violations in some other country  depending on whether or not the particular regime is to our liking.155.	We ought to have the courage to denounce all human rights violations wherever they occur and whoever are the perpetrators. That is the best way of ensuring respect for human rights everywhere and by all  because  as President Houphouet-Boigny  teaches us:""Mankind's well-being is not achieved by persecuting people. We cannot  without shame  proclaim that we are pursuing a policy of social development  a policy of progress  when concentration camps  political persecutions  torture  executions and segregation are growing in number.""We must  therefore  make our actions consistent with the conventions  charters and other solemn declarations to which we have freely adhered  and must ensure that our will to defend human rights does not once again remain a mere pious wish.156. We have confined ourselves in this statement to some of the fundamental problems whose rapid solution is indispensable for world peace. This does not mean that other problems are not of interest; we are equally concerned with their solution. Indeed  we hope that they will be solved as soon as possible.157 In this difficult world it is more important than ever for us to strengthen the role of the United Nations  the. ideal forum for reaching agreement  where we can all combine our efforts to speed up the solution of the political  economic  social and cultural problems confronting mankind. We must increase the capacity of the United Nations to enable it to act effectively to attain the purposes and objectives set forth in its Charter.158.	To that end  we are in duty bound to reaffirm our unreserved adherence to its ideals and our commitment to work untiringly  individually or collectively  to achieve them; to conform our daily actions to its principles; to implement in good faith its resolutions and decisions; and to resort to the Organization whenever international peace and security are in danger.159.	That is the commitment to which we invite you 3ll to subscribe to today. For its part  the Ivory Coast undertakes that commitment with redoubled faith in the triumph of the noble ideals of our Organization."
"26",1377,"CMR",32,1977,"﻿192.	 Sir  it is with the greatest pleasure that  on behalf of His Excellency Ahmadou Ahidjo  President of the United Republic of Cameroon  as well as on behalf of my delegation and in my own name  I join the preceding speakers at this rostrum in congratulating you most warmly upon your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.193.	Your accession to the high post bears witness  not only to your outstanding qualities as a person and a diplomat  and to your knowledge and vast experience of our Organization  but also to the high esteem and respect in which the international community holds your country  Yugoslavia  which is linked to my own by friendship and fruitful co-operation reinforced by the common aspiration to work together in our vast family of non-aligned countries for the safeguarding of peace freedom and the independence of peoples. We are convinced that under your authority and with your wisdom  our work will reach a successful conclusion. I wish to assure you at once of the full co-operation of my delegation.194.	May I also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate and to express my sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  for the devotion  intelligence and tact with which he effectively performed the triple role of Chairman of the non-aligned group in the United Nations  Chairman of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the. Sea and President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.195.	Finally we are particularly pleased to reiterate here the support and appreciation of the Government of Cameroon for our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his efforts to advance me purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We wish him every success in the discharge of his second term of office.196.	We are happy that the United Nations has been enriched during this session by the addition of two new States  whose admission Cameroon had the joy and honour of sponsoring: the Republic of Djibouti  a sister-country with origins in both Arab and African cultures  whose independence marks an important step in the process of the elimination of colonialism in Africa  and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose struggle for admission to our Organization Cameroon supported during our presidency of the Security Council. Its presence among us constitutes an historic and significant proof of the invincibility of peoples struggling for their freedom and dignity. We welcome them most cordially and assure of our desire to strive for the development of co-operation in every field. By admitting those new Members  the United Nations is coming closer to the ideal of universality.197.	The general debate in which we have the honour to participate at each session of our Assembly should be for all States gathered here an ideal opportunity periodically to assess how far we have come in implementing the principles enshrined in our Charter and the progress achieved in the attainment of the principal objectives  maintaining international peace and security  promoting international cooperation and settling international economic  social  intellectual and humanitarian problems.198.	It is in order to take account of the constant struggle of peoples for their well-being  for the safeguarding of human freedom and dignity  that we are led to believe that the dialogue we pursue in this Assembly should enable the Organization to be an effective centre for the harmonization of mankind's common efforts in its long march towards full fruition and happiness.199.	It is with this concern in mind that we examine the past year.200.	International life seems to us indeed to be marked by all sorts of growing tensions and conflicts. Among these are the varied struggles for hegemony in which the great Powers are engaged in a constant effort to strengthen their security to ever-higher levels  thus triggering a renewed arms race  despite their declarations in favour of peace. A similar source of tension is the persistence of the scourges of colonialism and racism  the most repugnant and criminal form of which is still apartheid. Yet another source of tension is the resistance to change on the part of those who advocate the present economic order  which enables 30 per cent of the world's population to possess 70 per cent of the wealth of our planet.201.	For all those reasons  the period under review was one of disappointed hopes  and we agree with the observation of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the United Nations that the past year does not lead us to be sanguine  because none of the proposals made by our Organization for a just and equitable settlement of the difficult problems facing our world has been begun to be solved. On the contrary  new problems have been added to those which already existed  and are now in the forefront  thus rendering the international situation even more complex and explosive.202.	Moreover  economic disarray has never been so pronounced: the old economic order in which we live  which some are still trying to shore up by hopelessly inadequate remedies  is sinking everywhere. That unjust system whereby a few countries control 80 per cent of world trade  nearly 95 per cent of private investments  an enormous part of world industry and almost all its technology have left two thirds of mankind in a state of poverty and squalor. A generator of inflation  of monetary disorders  of recession and unemployment  that system has constantly weakened the position of the developing countries by bringing about a deterioration in their terms of trade and by lessening their purchasing power  thus rendering null and void the vast efforts and sacrifices made by these countries at the national level.203.	These turbulences had to reach an extreme pitch  where they jeopardized the most solidly established existing economies before the international community finally became aware of its interdependence and the unity of its destiny.204.	That was why our Assembly adopted resolutions on the establishment of a new international economic order and 3202 and on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States as well as certain resolutions relating to economic development and international co-operation.205.	It is understandable that the hopes which had been aroused by the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  which was intended to alter in depth the structures of the old order and lay the groundwork for a new and more equitable economic order  should have been all the more frustrated because the concrete proposals made by the developing countries  which could have represented substantial progress along that path  were blocked from the outset by purely internal and limited considerations on the part of the industrialized countries  which preferred to hold fast to their acquired advantages  their selfish interests and their established life-styles  rather than tolerate a change calculated to bring about a world economic development on the basis of solidarity.206.	Indeed  the developing countries had expected real changes in Paris and that solutions would be found without delay for the pressing problems which they were facing in the areas of raw materials and trade  development  and financial and monetary co-operation.207.	The limited results of the Paris Conference are far from satisfying the developing world as a whole.208.	But rather than enmeshing ourselves in the coils of controversy about hew to evaluate the results  it seems to us that we must now channel our efforts towards the future in three directions. First  we must strive to ensure that the developed countries comply with all the commitments they have so far freely entered into in international forums. Secondly  we must resume and complete  within the United Nations system  negotiations in fields where an agreement is possible. Thirdly  we must resume negotiations on questions which have been stumbling-blocks and find adequate solutions which  as President Ahidjo recently said  ""will make it possible to take into account the legitimate aspirations of the third world to equality and concerted progress"".209.	There is no need to be a prophet to predict that  if nothing is done within a reasonable time to improve the situation of the developing countries  their growing bitterness will surely give rise to increasingly dangerous tensions in the world.210.	The sums swallowed up by the production of military arsenals come close to $350 billion  whereas aid for development barely reaches $15 billion. Let us recall that mankind has also devoted to the arms race since the Second World War more than $6 000 billion  which nearly equals the gross national product of the entire world for the year 1977.211.	This comparison is obviously not arbitrary. On the contrary  the stagnation  and even contraction  of public aid to development is the direct consequence of the arms race. In fact  while arms production contributes to the promotion of the economic activities of certain States  it undoubtedly leads to pauperization of the developing countries  which have become the tools of ideological confrontations and struggles for hegemony  thus misdirecting their burning desire to devote their resources to212.	We hope that the next special session of the General Assembly  which will be devoted to disarmament  wilt adopt measures calculated to promote real progress towards limiting nuclear weapons and that once confidence has been re-established the amounts allocated thus far to the balance of terror will be transferred to and used for the pressing needs of economic and social development and the improvement of the well-being of mankind.213.	The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea recently completed its work at New York  where it prepared an unofficial single composite negotiating text. That text will be submitted at the next session of the Conference  to be held at Geneva starting on 27 March 1978.214.	On some points the text submitted seems to be based on innovating trends which emerged in international relations in recent years and to have taken into account the legitimate aspirations of all the members of the international community. However  consensus is far off on several articles  on precisely those which require the boldest imagination in determining the modalities for the exploitation of the sea-bed for the benefit of all countries  particularly the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged countries.215.	Cameroon  like the other members of the Group of 77  hopes that solutions can be found. It cannot be otherwise as the Conference thus far has had the merit of being influenced by the strong determination of all the participants to arrive at realistic solutions which would be acceptable to the international community as a whole.216.	At the political level we are bound to note that the situation also has not improved.217.	Thus  in the Middle East the State of Israel has persisted in occupying Arab territories by force since 1967 and in refusing to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We are still convinced that there can be no just and lasting peace in that region except within the framework of a global settlement on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973)  and the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people. Consequently  we have welcomed with hope the recent declarations of certain parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict which seemed to augur well for an early meeting of the Geneva Peace Conference with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.218.	Indeed  as the Palestinian problem is the crux of the conflict  it is neither just nor reasonable  still less realistic  to envisage a lasting settlement without the effective participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the genuine representative of the Palestinian people.219.	We therefore appeal to all States which can take action designed to help to change the intransigence of the Tel Aviv Government to induce that Government finally to conform sincerely to the ideals and objectives of our Charter.220.	Our membership in the great movement of the non-aligned countries naturally leads us to be concerned over the situation in Cyprus  a founding member of that movement which  because of international tensions exacerbated by external interference  is threatened in its very essence as a united State  master of its own destiny. We fear that the untimely death of its unquestioned and honoured leader may further rekindle the embers of dissension.221.	The efforts made to promote constructive talks between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in a spirit of moderation and mutual understanding must be pursued in order to assist them to arrive at a settlement acceptable to both sides that will safeguard the territorial integrity  independence and non-alignment of that country in conformity with the spirit and letter of the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.222.	The problems that I have just mentioned cause us deep concern; but our anxiety is all the greater when we turn our gaze towards Africa  where the situation is particularly alarming in view of the many upheavals and the winds of division that are agitating our continent. Need I say again that it is the experience and conviction of Cameroon that opposition among African countries cannot but weaken them  encourage foreign interference and divert our energies from the true problems that persist in our continent: speedy development and complete liberation from racial domination.223.	It goes without saying that  in our determination to continue to affirm the original identity of Africa in the world and to play an active role in the elaboration of new international relations based on peace  justice and concerted progress  our continent must reject interference  because interference is to be condemned; we must preserve and further consolidate our unity within the OAU  which was established for that noble purpose. That means that Africa must strive to be more fully the master of its destiny and avoid becoming the private battlefield of rivalries among various Powers; likewise  the true friends of Africa should assist us instead of encouraging fratricidal struggles and the self-destruction that ideological conflict fosters. Peace is universal. Africa  I repeat  needs peace for its development and complete liberation.224.	As we have said  the inevitable process of decolonization has just entered a new phase with the independence ofDjibouti on 27 June of this year. Our rejoicing at this happy outcome is great; equally great is our desire for assurances that the United Nations resolution concerning respect for the territorial integrity of the Republic of the Comoros of which Mayotte is an integral part  will be implemented.225.	Because Africa can never feel wholly free until it is completely rid of every vestige of colonialism and of the scourges of apartheid and racism  it is aware of the crucial nature of the present phase in the struggle for liberation in southern Africa. Similarly  since freedom is indivisible  the international community itself cannot feel secure so long as a tyrannical regime which has elevated the systematic denial of the most elementary human rights to the status of a political philosophy and system of government flourishes in southern Africa. It is therefore a sacred duty for us to employ every means to make the white minority racists heed the voice of reason instead of ferociously pursuing the extermination of an entire people after having taken from it 80 per cent of its territory and reduced it to slavery.226.	Last year  at this same time  those who are the allies and accomplices of the ignoble regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury or who are deluded by them urged us to have patience and dangled before our eyes the prospect of a negotiated and orderly transfer of power to the majority. We expressed our scepticism at that time about what seemed to us to be nothing but manoeuvres inspired by the necessities of domestic politics. Today we wish that events had not proved us right. Indeed  in Zimbabwe  Ian Smith  the usurper  far from having yielded power to the majority  has turned his back on any settlement negotiated with those who are fighting  is organizing a mockery of ""elections"" and periodically massacres the peaceful civilian populations of Zambia  Botswana and Mozambique.227.	We are very pleased with Security Council resolution 411 (1977). adopted on 30 June last  which recognizes the ineffectiveness of sanctions and encourages States to seek more effective means to bring down the illegal Salisbury regime  whose existence and activities represent a grave threat to international peace and security.228.	While we are attentively following the Anglo- American initiative  we nevertheless remain very sceptical about the co-operation that can be expected from the rebel Ian Smith  who has so far accustomed us to his bad faith and his cynicism.229.	The problem of the international Territory of Namibia  which has regularly appeared on the agenda of the General Assembly since 1946  is already an indelible blot on the history of the United Nations  which so far has been powerless to take up the challenge flung in the face of the world in the middle of the twentieth century by a handful of white racists entrenched in South Africa. Despite the many resolutions adopted by both the General Assembly and the Security Council of our Organization  the racist regime is strengthening its illegal domination over Namibia  whose vast resources are the object of shameless pillage  while the hateful system of apartheid extends its oppression over the land. That state of affairs could not have continued or have been consolidated with impunity were it not for the complicity of many who were prompted by sordid interests.230.	We have followed with interest the efforts made by the five Powers  even though any dialogue with men who are racists to the core now seems to us to be a vain hope. In this regard  right now when the need to respect human rights is being given special attention by the international community  more resolute action must from now on take the place of condemnations or mere declarations of sympathy.231.	It is high time for the international community as a whole and each of its members in particular to give positive support to the struggle being waged by SWAPO  the only authentic representative of the Namibian people  so as to put an end unconditionally and without delay to the illegal occupation of Namibia.232.	The oppressive system which rules Azania has often been described here and in the international press by thoroughly impartial witnesses as the most diabolical a human brain has ever conceived. The United Nations has recognized that apartheid is a crime against humanity. While life is dear to every man  the people of Azania has become aware that death itself is preferable to the particularly barbaric slavery of which it is a victim. It is no longer daunted by the bullets of its assassins. But we now know since the Soweto massacres that the seeds of violence  fertilized by the blood of many innocent children  will produce an abundant harvest of freedom-in despite of Mr. Vorster  who has set up the scarecrow of atomic weaponry in vain.233.	I should not like to end this statement without leaving with the members of this Assembly the words of His Excellency Ahmadou Ahidjo  the President of the United Republic of Cameroon  who  on 8 August 1977  stated in respect of southern Africa that:""Human rights are indivisible and must be respected everywhere and by all nations. It is an illusion to believe that they can be protected in one part of the world while they are violated with impunity in other parts. The determination and arrogance of the supporters of racial domination must be met with equal determination and unfailing steadfastness in our support of the liberation movements and the dignity of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania.""

"27",1419,"COD",32,1977,"﻿110.	 Mr. President  allow me to convey to you warmest congratulations on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf on the occasion of your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.111.	Your well-deserved election is a recognition by the world community of the active part unceasingly played by your country in the international arena. Your personal qualities are an added guarantee of the success of the current session.112.	May I also extend my congratulations to all your fellow officers  whose collaboration will be of great value to the presidency.113.	I should like  too  to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  for highly skilful and successful conduct of the deliberations of the last session.114.	Beside you  Mr. President  there sits a man who brings you inestimable and invaluable co-operation. I am referring to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  whose dedication to the exalting task of seeing the principles and ideals of our Charter triumph justifies all the hopes that the international community has placed in him.115.	It is not without considerable feeling that my delegation noted the disturbing conclusions of the report of the Secretary-General concerning the question of peace throughout the world  because international peace  security and co-operation in sovereign equality are the major objectives of our Charter. I therefore wish to review briefly under these three headings the events that have occurred in the world since our last meeting here in New York.116.	With respect to peace in the world  two major topics occupy the attention of my delegation  namely  the Middle East question and the situation in southern Africa. The situation in the Middle East remains a hot-bed of tension in that part of the world and a very serious threat to international peace and security. The Middle East crisis in all its essence and in all its manifestations is  as we cannot deny  so highly complex that it makes difficult any search for an equitable and just solution likely to satisfy all the parties concerned.117.	At each session of the General Assembly my delegation expresses its concern on the subject. On 4 October 1973  speaking from this same rostrum  President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire stated:""In the Middle East there exist three kinds of reflexes: the reflex of fear  for the Israeli people; the reflex of despair  for the Palestinian people; and the reflex of humiliation for the Arab people.""118.	My country is convinced in its view that all peoples in that region have the right to a life of dignity and to the respect of their fundamental and undeniable rights  whether they be Israelis  Palestinians or Arabs.119.	In my delegation's view the Middle East crisis is mainly the problem of what is to be the fate of the Palestinians. But each of the parties concerned must make an effort to rise above the past; otherwise it will be extremely difficult to arrive at a solution of this crisis. It is the imperative duty of our Organization and its Members to assist them in that task. In this connexion  and given the difficulties of the task  it would appear that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) can serve as a basis for fruitful negotiations. Since the last session of the General Assembly we have noted that the parties concerned have taken numerous stands. It would appear that there is  despite everything  a ray of hope for the resumption or possible resumption of the Geneva Conference with the participation of all the interested parties.120.	For my delegation  three fundamental conditions  without which no durable solution of the Middle East crisis is possible  must be fulfilled: first  the evacuation by Israel of all the Arab territories occupied since 1967; next  the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland  self-determination and independence and  finally  the right for all States in the region to exist within recognized frontiers  including the State of Israel itself.121.	With the accession of Djibouti to independence  Africa could have been wholly liberated were it not for the fact that there remains in the southern part of our continent a colonial situation of a special nature which is altogether ignoble and intolerable. In southern Africa  in fact  apartheid and racial discrimination have been raised to the status of a political doctrine; a white minority has usurped all political and economic rights to the detriment of the black majority.122.	The illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia  notwithstanding the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and all the advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice  is a constant and permanent challenge to the international community. South Africa must return that Territory to the United Nations without delay and respect its territorial integrity. It is urgent that SWAPO  which was recognized as the legitimate representative of the Namibian peoples  should take into its hands the destiny of that Territory. The international community can no longer tolerate the tergiversations or dilatory manoeuvres so dear to the racist Pretoria regime. The regrettable situation that prevails at present in Zimbabwe is the outcome of over 12 years of stubbornness on the part of the Ian Smith clique.123.	President Obasanjo of Nigeria during his visit- to the Republic of Zaire and President Mobutu both recognized that the Anglo-American plan  if it was correctly applied with the utmost good faith  would constitute a positive step and important stage for the peaceful settlement of the crisis in Zimbabwe  and that in that sense the plan should therefore be encouraged. My delegation nurtures the hope that the negotiations to be opened between the parties concerned will allow for the establishment in Zimbabwe of a government by the legitimate  militant majority.124.	We are gratified at the adoption by the Security Council on 29 September last of resolution 415 (1977)  requesting the Secretary-General to appoint a United Nations representative to the British Resident Commissioner in Zimbabwe. We are happy to note that all the parties concerned  those mainly interested in the problem  have endorsed that resolution. Since then  my delegation has been hoping that all will prove their goodwill and show their good faith in order to give the Secretary-General the necessary co-operation for the proper implementation of that resolution. In particular  my delegation would ask all those who  from far or near  exert some influence on the rebel Ian Smith to dissuade him from hindering the strict Implementation of that resolution. Among the friends of Ian Smith we must mention first Vorster  the champion of apartheid. The heinous policy of apartheid in South Africa has always been condemned by the entire international community because it constitutes  as we have repeatedly stated  a crime against humanity. We cannot but continue to condemn vehemently all the barbarous acts perpetrated against African patriots from Sharpeville to the cowardly murder of Steve Biko  because there is no doubt that the unclear circumstances surrounding his death leave no doubt as to the nature of his passing. My delegation bows to the memory of that worthy son of struggling Africa  How can we fail to condemn once again the negative attitude of the South African racists who have always flouted all the relevant resolutions of our Organization  thus defying world public opinion?125.	Today  still defying that opinion and despite all attempts to dissuade it  South Africa apparently is getting ready to test an atomic bomb. If that bomb does not yet exist  South Africa is on the point of possessing it. How did it obtain it? What is it to be used for? Surely against the freedom fighters. Is it  then  a weapon for blackmail? Yes  in one sense. But it so happens  and this is an important point  that we are faced with a serious threat to the African countries which help and assist the liberation movements engaged in the struggle for a just cause.126.	We said a moment ago that the system of apartheid had not found any other defenders in the world than its own authors  because as far as we know  everyone here and all States without exception condemn this shameful practice.127.	Now  those who  in one way or another  from near or far  assist South Africa in providing itself with this highly deadly weapon  are contradicting themselves because they cannot honestly condemn apartheid while at the same time agreeing that the South African regime should have such powerful means to continue its policy.128.	In any event  with South Africa's acquisition of an atomic bomb the already precarious balance of forces in that part of Africa is seriously upset. We must restore that balance  even at the price of a pact with the devil.129.	The desire to maintain the balance of power between States led the United Nations system to concern itself with disarmament. Many meetings and conferences were devoted to the subject. But we must admit that the results thus far have been very meagre. Questions of disarmament are of interest to us all  the large  the medium and the small countries  because of the nefarious consequences of nuclear weapons for the world. Thus the $350 billion spent by the rich States in armaments represents a true squandering of resources of which the rest of mankind is dangerously deprived. We must therefore consider disarmament a benefit for all.130.	Moreover  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  of which one hears so much  could not be an end in itself. Such a conception would leave in the hands of those who have the atomic bomb an intolerable instrument of blackmail since they consider themselves to be the tutors of other States. The non-proliferation Treaty must be regarded as an important step  it is true  along the road to general and complete disarmament  which must lead to the disarmament of minds.131.	In fact  peaceful relations are one of the aims and objectives of our Organization's Charter  which  moreover  prohibits recourse to force in the settlement of international conflicts. That is why Zaire spoke out in favour of the adoption by the international community of a draft treaty on the subject  a draft treaty submitted last year by the Soviet Union and designed to remind us constantly of our obligations vis-à-vis peace  international security  non-interference in the affairs of other States  and the need for dialogue and international co-operation. This last subject is one of the cardinal points of my country's foreign policy.132.	Article 77 of our Constitution states:""In order to promote African unity  in particular  the Republic [of Zaire] may conclude treaties and association agreements which may entail the partial surrender of its sovereignty.""African unity is something that Zaire continues not only to believe in but also works to consolidate. As the Manifesto of Nsele  the charter of our national party  states:""Africa must come forward as a block in international dialogues. The Popular Revolutionary Movement supports and will support with all its strength a policy of African solidarity through its effective contribution to the Organization of African Unity.""After all  are not many of our problems in reality African problems? Beyond the frontiers  the hand of the Republic of Zaire will always be held out in order to encourage similar attitudes among our African brothers. Zaire is in the centre of Africa and cannot shirk its mission  that of acting as a link between its brother States in the north and in the south  in the east and in the west.133.	I now wish to take up questions of trade and the problems of development and co-operation at the world level. The most remarkable aspects of world trade in the last three years have been inflation  the upheavals in the international monetary system  the energy crisis and the deterioration in the balance of payments of most of the developing countries  especially the least advanced and the poorest.134.	The accumulation of oil revenues which we see among some of our brothers in the process of development cannot in any way be interpreted as an improvement of the economic situation of the developing countries. It simply emphasizes  we think  the primary importance of oil at the technological level at present attained in the exploitation of natural resources in the world. But at the same time  it highlights the vulnerability of those economies that are based on the export of a single commodity.135.	Thus  the efforts at the world level to improve the generalized system of preferences are still timely  as are also those to improve the purchasing power of the export earnings of primary commodities  to fight against resurgent protectionist measures and other non-tariff barriers  and to transfer to the developing countries part of the structures for the processing of raw materials. None of the meetings and conferences held throughout the last year in New York  Geneva  Nairobi or elsewhere in the world has brought even the beginning of a solution to these problems.136.	In the field of economic and- social development  may I be permitted to emphasize the concern of my delegation about the apathy of the world community concerning the practical application of the international measures advocated by our Organization.137.	This is why my delegation shares the concern of the Economic and Social Council over the lack of progress in the implementation of resolutions adopted at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  the Lima Declaration and the decisions reached at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi. Because at each of these meetings the international community has endorsed all these decisions  we believe it is urgent that our Organization make efforts to fill the gaps we have witnessed in the achievement of the aims  and objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. Item 67 of our agenda  we are gratified to see  will offer us an opportunity to tackle this problem in detail.138.	As we all know  the-accumulation of decisions that are not implemented blocks the whole mechanism of the United Nations. It is more than high time not only to be realistic  but also to show loyalty and sincerity and to live up to one's word.139.	No one questions the fact that the importance of a country is gauged among other things in terms of its technical achievements.-In fact it is through these means that man can expect to dominate the world and improve the fate of his fellow men. In our view-and this is almost a glimpse of the obvious—the economic and social development of under-developed countries will only become a reality when they have really made some technological achievements. The developed countries know they should not continue to shirk their international obligations in this field.140.	This aspect of development places us squarely in the field of industrialization—in other words  the field of action of UNIDO.141.	We can congratulate ourselves on the positive efforts made by the secretariat of UNIDO to achieve the implementation of the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action. The lack of progress in this field is explained frequently by reason of the very limited participation of most of the Member States.142.	Since we are speaking of co-operation  we should also like to express 'our regret at the negative results of the resumption of the Assembly's thirty-first session to evaluate the results of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  on which our country had placed so many hopes  taking into account the financial and intellectual efforts made by the participants  and which has enabled us in some fields to consider in detail the aspects of technical and political co-operation. That session afforded us an opportunity to understand each other better. The deadlock at the thirty-first session with regard to the Paris Conference appears to be explained by the fact that perhaps no one wanted to attribute to the North-South dialogue the role that it could not play—that of somehow performing miracles.143.	We would hope that the failure of the resumption of the thirty-first session will in no way cancel out the commitments assumed by the developed countries in Paris. Let us recall that those countries agreed to carry out negotiations on the establishment of a common fund for primary commodities  and that they committed themselves to create a special fund to assist the poorest countries and said they were ready to reflect on the need to assist the African countries in solving their problems of infrastructure  transportation and communication.144.	The session that ended on 19 September last highlighted the urgent need for the international community to show imagination in order to obtain a triple objective: first  to define clearly and unequivocally the aims and objectives of action to be undertaken within the framework of the inauguration of a new international economic order; next  in my delegation's view  to adopt measures for the achievement of those aims and objectives; and lastly  to keep alive the flame of dialogue between developed and developing countries.145.	It is with an invitation that I should like to end this review of world economic and trade problems: an invitation to the international community to pay more attention to the lack of progress in the implementation of the relevant resolutions on the economic development of the developing countries. This community should resolutely engage in the task of filling the gaps that we note in the fulfilment of the aims and objectives of the International Development Strategy. We must  finally  step up our dialogue and negotiations in different United Nations bodies in order to establish a more just and equitable international economic order.146.	Before concluding I should like briefly to recall the encouraging results of the United Nations Conference on Desertification. The efforts exerted in the Kenyan capital between 29 August and 9 September 1977 made it possible to propose a realistic and effective plan of action accompanied by financial and institutional recommendations that would allow for its implementation.147.	The world community is thus fully informed of the complexity of the struggle against this scourge. This struggle requires a combination of knowledge  technical and financial means  and human resources. It presupposes a great effort at the national  regional  interregional and even the world level. My delegation hopes that once it is adopted and we have settled the institutional questions and financial arrangements  the plan of action proposed by the Secretariat will be rapidly implemented. The countries of the third world  and the African countries in particular  which suffer most from desertification and the lack of resources necessary to face these problems  are looking for massive assistance from all countries and in particular from the developed countries.148.	I should like to conclude by greeting the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose presence in our midst is a valuable lesson for all those who throughout the world are engaged in a war aimed at dividing the peoples of a single continent  although that war is clearly destined for failure. May we also extend a welcome to the sister republic of Djibouti  especially at this time  when Africa is being shaken and the fragile edifice of the OAU is being sorely tried.149.	It is our conviction that in this area nothing can defeat Africa since it will always defend its true values with conviction and determination. "
"28",1465,"COG",32,1977,"﻿307.	 The ideals of peace  equality and co-operation among nations—ideals that are all summed up in the word  justice —which the authors of the Charter of our Organization already proclaimed 32 years ago are still today of intense concern. Everything points to that. The most disquieting inquiries are constantly devoted to the  major questions  of today's world. Meetings  conferences  information  files  texts  ever on the increase and always relevant  are distinguished by the fact that they keep international problems in a type of closed circuit. This is a paradox only in appearance. Does it perhaps fundamentally reflect a cynical or disabused human attitude  or in any case an attitude that is only mildly courageous  in the face of the important problems of our time which disclose a world facing immense crises: economies in distress  the tyranny of certain regimes  oppression of peoples  moral and material poverty  thermonuclear war on the horizon  crises which run the risk of lighting the final conflagration?308.	The political and psychological context of its work should of necessity invite the United Nations to prevent itself from being dragged downwards in straying away from its original noble ideals. Therein lies hope for all of us and for mankind as a whole. The essential question is  consequently  the capability of the United Nations to take full responsibility for the major questions which affect all mankind. It is reassuring that the United Nations is constantly being served by devoted men who are convinced of the usefulness of the activities of the institution. The President of the General Assembly is one of those men  as is also the Secretary-General. You are among those modern men who are courageously and actively fighting against the spirit of the desert  the spirit of devastation  which is perhaps the most astonishing historical product of our time  but also the least questioned.309.	The people of Congo and the forces of progress throughout the world mourned with distress the tragic death on 18 March 1977 of President Marien Ngouabi  the President of the People's Republic of Congo  who was cowardly murdered by the forces of evil. That odious crime  the aim of which was to destroy the Congolese revolution  did not achieve its purpose since the Congolese people are more than ever determined to defend the ideals for which President Marien Ngouabi heroically gave his life. The heroes of the twentieth century are precisely those who defend to the very end the causes of oppressed peoples and  even in their glorious death  they speak for all mankind.310.	The leading institutions established by law faithfully continue the work of President Ngouabi. In a declaration of general policy  President Joachim Yhomby Opango proclaimed the will of the Congolese people to continue their foreign policy and their international co-operation along the same lines which had been followed by President Marien Ngouabi  namely  by struggling against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and the exploitation of man by man  and against racial discrimination and all forms of oppression  by unconditionally supporting just causes  by giving international assistance of many kinds to the true movements of national liberation  by their desire to establish relations of co-operation with all the countries which seek  on the basis of mutual respect and equality  a policy of good-neighbourliness and African solidarity  and by their attachment to peace and to the principles defined in the Charters of OAU and the United Nations.311.	I should like to emphasize somewhat a point which has just been made.312.	The African vocation of my country has never been questioned and President Yhomby Opango intends to strengthen Congo's devotion to African solidarity. There is no African situation which does not concern us. Our policy concerning other African States is a policy of understanding  tolerance  good-neighbourliness and co-operation  in spite of ideological differences which may exist between us and others. African causes have always found unswerving support among the Congolese people. Therefore it would not be well to compare the administrative measures taken recently by my Government for the control of foreigners to a policy harmful to the strengthening of African solidarity. Quite the contrary. The measures to which I am alluding concerned only those foreigners whose situation was irregular vis-à-vis the laws and regulations of Congo concerning immigration and the practice of trade.313.	We are now at a turning-point in the modern history of the African continent. I had occasion here last year to say what the views of my Government were concerning the future of that continent. Now the problems have changed abruptly with the accession of South Africa to the club of atomic Powers.314.	This situation is an extremely serious one and  before the United Nations  before the international community and before all mankind  I wish to accuse and publicly condemn without any equivocation the country of apartheid. I am compelled to be very specific in this accusation.315.	The South African nuclear programme has been under way for 16 years  from 1961 to 1977. In 1961 South Africa acquired through a United States company a small thermal reactor of 2C megawatts. The pilot plant of Walindaba  close to Pretoria  produced uranium 235 following a variant of a  blasting  procedure. In 1965 special laboratories of the Federal Republic of Germany opened their doors to South African scientists and technicians. In July 1970 Pretoria announced that South African experts had discovered an original procedure for uranium enrichment. In 1975 West German firms actively gave technical assistance to the South Africans in fitting out their uranium enrichment plant. In 1976 Pretoria selected France to build two gigantic nuclear power stations at Koelberg  28 kilometres north of the Cape By about 1985 the two French power plants to be delivered to South Africa will produce 500 kilos of plutonium per annum  that is to say  enough to manufacture 100 atomic bombs of the Nagasaki type.316.	At the very beginning of August 1977 the Soviet Union fortunately alerted world public opinion to the imminence of the explosion of a South African atomic bomb in the Kalahari desert  approximately 180 kilometres south of Botswana and 150 kilometres to the east of Namibia317.	I accuse the Western Powers which have actively helped South Africa to acquire a nuclear potential which dangerously jeopardizes peace in Africa and the rest of the world. I accuse the West and Pretoria of collusion. I accuse South Africa  which has no intention of heeding anyone's advice but plans to follow its nuclear programme.318.	The African peoples must clearly realize that the problem of their security today has a new dimension319.	We most urgently appeal to all the peoples of Africa and the world strongly to react against the nuclear arming of the most racist country on earth.320.	The nuclear explosion which South Africa has postponed but which it has not renounced most perforce bring the international community to reflect on the consequences of the many-sided co-operation between certain countries Members of the United Nations and the racists of Pretoria.321.	The security of the African peoples is being seriously threatened322.	Experience has amply taught us that regimes of terror and oppression which thrive on violence understand only the language of violence In view of Pretoria's anachronistic attitude Namibia will not be freed except at that price. My country cannot but continue to give unconditional support to the South West Africa People's Organization in its determination to intensify the armed struggle for the liberation of Namibia.323.	The same holds true for Rhodesia  where Ian Smith—whom we can only describe as mindless-is spending his time destroying the numerous plans for a settlement that have been put forward precisely to allow him to avoid the worst.324.	That is why it is the duty of the international community firmly to support the initiatives of the frontline countries. These initiatives  which have been approved by OAU  make it possible to find a just solution for the people of Zimbabwe  which  like any other people on earth  aspires to freedom  equality and dignity.325.	The decolonization of Africa must be concluded without delay.326.	In this connexion we most warmly welcome the admission to our Organization of the Republic of Djibouti. We wish to consolidate with that brother African country close relations of co-operation and active solidarity.327.	We also congratulate the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose reunification after the brilliant victory of 1975 was welcomed in the People's Republic of Congo as a great event in the history of the struggle of peoples to regain their freedom. The presence in our midst of the Vietnamese delegation is magnificent proof of the assertion that just causes always triumph in the end.328.	The victory of the Vietnamese people  on whom 30 years of futile war were imposed  gives us added resolve in our unverving support for liberation struggles.329.	We also believe that the peaceful reunification of Korea is inevitable. It is not a good policy always to refuse to face the facts.330.	We are also convinced of the coming victory of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples. A people cannot renounce its fundamental rights  even if it is subjected to all kinds of crafty reprisals. We are following with keen interest the preparations for the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. We remain convinced that no lasting solution to this problem can be found without the actual participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole representative of the Palestinian people.331.	A study of the social and economic situation of the world reveals that anachronistic situations persist. It is not right to wish to perpetuate them. The rule of force only lasts for a time. The challenges facing mankind—economic crises  unequal development  malnutrition  illiteracy  ecological problems  pollution  the difficulties of mastering science and technology—can only be met if we deliberately make use of all the capabilities  all the recourses and all the resources at our disposal. The problem of mankind's survival in a world which is continually faced with profound material  cultural and spiritual crises is an immense problem which requires the mobilization of the gifts and the energies we still have available.332.	The appeal which we are making for a more equal world is not an appeal for generosity or a spirit of sacrifice on the part of the so-called  rich  in favour of so many million so-called  poor . It is fundamentally an appeal to one and all to realize the true dimensions of the crucial problem of contemporary international relations.333.	I should lie to elaborate. During the seventeenth century—not to go back farther in history-approximately 500 million human beings lived on our planet; in 1900 mankind numbered more than 1.6 billion. Today there are some 4 billion  and this population will rapidly increase if present tendencies continue  particularly in the third world.334.	Mankind today seems to have overshot the mark in accumulating atomic bombs and chemical and bacteriological weapons  in squandering natural resources and in polluting the atmosphere. Moreover  the poorest but most densely populated regions are helping to increase the well-being of the richest.335.	The fundamental problem today  which is evoked by the theme of the  new international economic order   is truly the economic and political transformation of mankind.336.	The cultural progress of humanity will from now on make all societies acutely aware of the solidarity of all human beings. This solidarity of all mankind generates respect for one another and a collective commitment to the great common enterprise of the building of peace and the welfare of mankind.337.	But today all seems to lead to merciless confrontations because of the obstinacy of a few whose reactions to the grave problems of our day are mere agonizing and selfishness.338.	That explains man's inability to adjust to the present situation; that is what is complicating the solutions to problems. It is not a question of increasing the volume of our charity  but of sharing resources  knowledge and the applications of science more equitably; it is a question of better prices for third-world products  of a better international division of labour  in the interest of the whole international community339.	It would be unnatural to dissociate human rights from the immense problem which I have just underscored. Humanity cannot achieve a superior civilization if men are not treated as such or if they are subjected to the most persistent and the crudest estrangement.340.	It is therefore highly appropriate that our efforts should be directed towards the protection of man  so long as we see the problem in all its dimensions: political  economic  cultural  social. Within our different societies  we have' too great a tendency to consider man from a social angle and to limit his rights to a few formal guarantees  while socially  economically  politically and culturally he is being destroyed. Man must be considered as a whole  and human rights constitute a whole. Human rights must increase man's freedom and lead to further responsibility and to greater solidarity among mankind.341.	In conclusion  to change  to renew our ways of thinking  our attitudes and our behaviour is undoubtedly the most urgent task today  in view of the grave problems of this century  which is coming to an end. Our hope closely linked to our duty is one with the ardour of our Organization  which is more than ever enlightened and supported by the legitimate ambitions of mankind in revolt."
"29",1512,"COL",32,1977,"﻿199.	 My country feels that the election of Mr. Lazar Mojsov to the presidency  of this General Assembly is truly a felicitous decision. His intellectual and personal qualities represent the virtues of the Yugoslavs  a people which has upheld the image of the principles of its political organization but which also has coexisted constructively with the various ideological trends of our time and has contributed to the alleviation of tensions created by intolerance in the international community. Mr. Mojsov in the presidency is a guarantee that at this session the international Organization will make a sincere effort to work with the dynamism  authority and efficiency that the maintenance of world peace demands.200.	An effort is now more necessary than ever for the Assembly meets at a time when there are not many reasons for optimism and little progress has been made in finding solutions to the problems that have been discussed in recent years. As such solutions continue to evade us and the problems meet in international forums with the dilatory treatment of bureaucratic routine  the areas for friction become more numerous and the increasing tensions put to stringent tests the systems devised after the Second World War to settle disputes among nations within a freely accepted legal order.201.	Much light would be shed on the true nature of the present conflicts if we started by acknowledging the fact that the post-war world was organized as a political democracy of States recognized as equals-a democracy that was to coexist with an oligarchy of prosperous nations endowed with protective mechanisms rooted in the prestige of tradition and the influence of power.202.	If the democratic spirit of international institutions has had little success in moderating the old and new inequalities  that is due to the constant opposition of the tight network of institutions and practices protecting an economic order based on mechanisms which create and maintain an excessively unequal international distribution of wealth.203.	To appreciate the importance in international life of such practices and institutions  which constitute an economic world of their own  it should be enough to mention matters such as international liquidity; terms of trade between nations; trade restrictions; income distribution at the world level; and the control over technological progress and its effect on the new resources of the planet  such as the riches of the sea-bed or the uses of outer space.204.	While international organizations devise  without insurmountable difficulties  important concepts in matters of political democracy—as in the case of the protection of human rights  the struggle against racial discrimination  or the equal representation of States—on the other hand obstacles systematically arise whenever the powerful vested interests of a small group of affluent societies are involved  as for them the concepts of equality  equity and human rights are subjects that can be  and in fact are  excluded from the economic sphere  deemed by them to be a reserved area for inequalities  the predominance of power and the maintenance of the privileges and advantages acquired under the old international economic order.205.	Every legal-political organization can resist inequalities up to a certain critical point. One indication that we are nearing that point is that confrontations between developed and developing countries are becoming more and more widespread  and that industrial nations show a distinct tendency to discuss  outside this Organization the very problems that justify its existence. This tendency becomes even more serious when the Governments of industrial societies do not even oppose the consolidation of a certain attitude of public opinion in their countries which is adverse to the international organizations  an attitude inspired by the feeling that belonging to such organizations entails commitments and duties of solidarity that are viewed as hindrances to an unlimited enjoyment of the benefits yielded by their own prosperity.206.	It would  in all truthfulness  be unfair to say that the power  the wealth and the abundance enjoyed by the highly developed countries have been acquired by them at no cost and are unrelated to the strenuous efforts of their people over generations  and to the sacrifices they made to attain their current levels of pre-eminence and well-being. However  even though admitting such achievements and their merits  the explanations for the origin of the wide gap now separating peoples would be incomplete if no mention were made of the decisive role played in the distribution of wealth and poverty inherited by our generation by the power and the monopolistic concentration of their economic organizations.207.	The huge accumulation of wealth now concentrated in a few areas of the world  and which can be distributed among their inhabitants with a certain equity because of institutional mechanisms of those areas  is not only the result of the ingenuity and economic ethics they so frequently boast of  but also of the entrenchment  at the international level  of a pattern of relationships between the peoples of the entire world; between the areas north and south of the equator  and between the temperate and the tropical zones  where the value equations for products was set  in large measure  by means of coercive and often predatory procedures.208.	The mechanisms by which the world markets work  assumed to be automatic and impersonal by the established economic doctrines  were soon distorted by the monopoly prices the industrial societies set for their goods. Thus a situation took shape in which a small number of nations became a privileged world establishment while in the greater part of the world the laws of a free and competitive market for their exports did indeed apply. The inhabitants of these vast areas were despoiled of an ever increasing portion of the economic value of their work and this in a situation where the meagre income they were allowed precluded the use of distributive systems for the improvement of the population's appalling living conditions.209.	It is not therefore idle briefly to point out that the democratic spirit which inspired the Charter of the United Nations and the instruments created for its implementation has proved unequal to permeating economic institutions and practices or has been prevented from doing so.210.	Approaching these subjects somewhat at random  we could start by mentioning the important issue of international liquidity. The record of post-war international monetary institutions is characterized by the constant requests made by the developing countries that the volume of international means of payment should be sufficient for their trade needs and for the financing of the development and modernization processes  new phenomena requiring a revision of the solutions imposed by the victors of the Second World War. That revision became even more necessary in view of the fact that such solutions called for excessive ties between the international means of payment and the currencies of highly industrialized countries and  in practice  adjusted the volume of such means to trade flow of the industrial societies.211.	The systematic reply to such requests was that measures for increasing international liquidity in order to respond to trade needs and the financing of developing countries would lead to world inflation and the disruption of the monetary system and would cause a deep crisis in the economy. Those were the reasons given by the industrial societies in opposing the wishes of the developing countries  and they only tolerated minor reforms which coincided with the requirements of their own economic growth.212.	All that developing countries can do now is watch with amazement as they see how inflation  used as a pretext for refusing the changes requested in the international monetary system  has made its appearance on the world scene on a scale unprecedented in history. And that inflation was due to the political  economic and monetary measures-prompted by domestic and foreign considerations-of the very same industrial nations  which took great pride in their cautious orthodoxy. The crumbling of the foundations of the monetary system created after the war was not the doing of the economic policies of the developing countries. Those countries did not unleash world inflation  reignite the devaluation wars used to secure trade advantages or start domestic inflationary processes of such magnitude that they have been exported to the furthest reaches of the world. Those who dug the grave of the Bretton Woods Agreements were not the developing countries  but precisely the Powers which drew up and imposed those Agreements  which refused to modify them for as long as they served their own interests  and which then ignored them when their mechanisms no longer gave them the advantages initially afforded them. And today  paradoxically  they strive to attribute the crisis in the world economy to the efforts of some developing countries to defend the price levels of their exports  as the oil-producing countries did.213.	This brings us to the problems that result from the need to seek—if the planned new international economic order is to have any meaning—the most efficient means of avoiding the perpetuation of trade situations belonging to a time when the world economy worked on the undisputed assumption that prices of commodities and food-stuffs should be kept as low as possible while the prices of industrial goods should be free to increase constantly.214.	There would be more clarity and more progress along the road to the establishment of a new international economic order if the industrial societies and their populations were to understand in time that there are no reasons for. subjecting the prices of commodities and food to a regime of permanent under-valuation; and that a new division of labour in the world is an imperative which requires that the markets of those affluent societies accept the goods produced by nations in the first stages of their industrialization  just as developed countries should devote their efforts to. advanced-technology industries and the production of goods  equipment and services derived from their sophisticated technology.215.	Industrial societies would give proof of the political maturity expected of them because of their progress in other fields if they were prepared to live with the realities of the new era  typified by the disappearance of that resignation with which for centuries the majority of the planet's population bore the yoke of a trade system by virtue of which the prosperity of some was obtained at the expense of the ""non-development of others""-to quote a French economist.216.	Unfortunately  the recent conduct of industrial societies with regard to trade is not very encouraging. Their trade laws  the use of restrictive practices such as tariffs and par tariffs  the poor results of the so-called United Nations Development Decades and of the North-South dialogue  and the delay in enforcing the Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States all denote an insistence on maintaining the excessive advantages of the old international economic order.217.	It can hardly be though that a contribution is being made to co-operation between States when freedom of trade to expand markets for industrial goods is requested and simultaneously an anachronistic protectionism is applied again whenever commodities or manufactures of new industries in developing countries turn out to be competitive in the markets of affluent societies. It is indeed strangely contradictory to see the protectionist practices  historically devised for ""infant industries"" in the first stages of their modernization process  now being applied by countries at the summit of technological development against nations struggling laboriously in the initial stages of development. It is contradictory  because with this practice the balanced operation of the international economy is disrupted  as it is also by the restrictive practices and official and private boycotts the developed nations resort to when a situation of obvious scarcity in one commodity triggers a spasmodic increase in its price.218.	Understandably  then  it is trade between developed countries which has grown in recent years  while their trade flows with the developing world have suffered a gradual decrease. These centres of prosperity in the geographical areas where the affluent societies are located have monopolized the benefits of trade expansion  and their experts and economists have come to think that the world economy can function normally even when such expansion is held within the bounds of industrial societies. This gives an insight into their obvious preference for their own economic  financial and monetary alliances and their increasing lack of interest in any effort tending to enlarge their trade with the developing world. Apparently these experts assume that the magnitude of the flow of trade exclusively between highly industrialized societies is a sufficiently dynamic factor to maintain efficient and optimum activity in the world economy.219.	What the experience of history does tell us is that this optimistic assumption is very precarious. It is not new or typical of our age to believe that certain world trade patterns  because they favour one or more nations  can guarantee the smooth functioning of the international economy. In the past  such a claim resulted in deep crises when new nations appeared on the scene competing with traditional Powers in markets that did not expand  because they lacked any system to counteract the concentration of wealth in small areas of the planet.220.	In reality  we see the first signs of a similar situation. The frequency of recessions not followed  as was hoped  by genuine recoveries  the rebirth of protectionism among the major Powers as a tool to fight unemployment  and the low rates of economic activity  are all signs that we are nearing the end of the exceptional opportunities created by the ravages of the Second World War.221.	The reconstruction of the countries deeply affected by the conflict and the modernization of new nations have already created trade imbalances that point to the effects of unequal distribution of world demand. This casts doubt on the too-easily accepted hypothesis that mere expansion of trade between highly industrialized nations is an appropriate foundation for the operation of the world economy  and underlines the need for raising the levels of consumption of a major portion of the world's population kept  in the past as now  in a situation of scarcity and dangerous stagnation by a world market distorted by power mechanisms and monopolistic systems.222.	This is the true meaning of the desire to establish a new international order  all the more justified since it seeks not only to correct inequalities created by the impact of colonialism and the various forms of economic dependence but also to adjust the distribution of world demand to the enormous surge in the supply of goods and services from the gigantic production facilities of the present day  facilities which seem doomed to less and less use of their capacity if the traditional terms of trade are perpetuated.223.	When a structural—and not temporary—imbalance between supply and demand appears in a country  the remedy for it has generally been sought in reforms entailing a redistribution of income. The nations that have been most successful in their growth are those that have not allowed too great a concentration of income in small sectors of their population or territory.224.	I do not  of course  wish to say that the case of a national economy is completely similar to that of the international economy. However  we should be fully aware that today's alarming symptoms of a crisis  strikingly similar to those that preceded the great depressions  make it more than ever impossible to accept the wide gap now separating the under-developed peoples from those islands of -prosperity which shelter affluent societies  standing out solitary and arrogant in an ocean swept by the winds of poverty  backwardness and inequality that afflict the majority of the world's population.225.	This gap becomes even more alarming when new factors loom on the horizon which  if not treated with foresight and equity  will contribute to a serious disruption of coexistence between nations; for we are on the threshold of a critical era  when what is debated is more than the traditional way of distributing the resources known to humanity and used by it for thousands of years. Technology's spectacular progress and demographic pressures have given a sudden economic value to resources and elements in nature that were given scant attention in the past. Such is the case  for instance  with the sea and its wealth  and with the synchronous geostationary orbit that enables satellite communications to reach undreamed-of limits. If the great wealth of goods and resources  whose economic value has only recently begun to reveal itself  is left to the exclusive management of the nations in possession of the most advanced technologies  and if a circumstantial pre-eminence in the field of such technologies were used to claim a new title of ownership over critical resources on this earth  the antagonisms now eroding the coexistence mechanisms of the international community would become even deeper.226.	At a time when there is increasing tension between the democratic spirit of the international Organization and the vested interests of a group of nations which have had ample opportunity to enjoy the advantages acquired in the past  Colombia is confident that the countries entrusted with the maintenance of peace will not  by acts of omission or commission  allow such tension to reach critical limits. In the same way  Colombia trusts that these countries will not yield to the temptation of regarding as a victory or an act of wisdom the possible prolongation of the tottering reign of an economic order which is already posing serious problems to the very countries that derived the greatest benefits from it.227.	A historic example of how goodwill and genuine foresight can eliminate situations which have lost all justification in modern times is the recent settlement between the Governments of the United States of America and Panama concerning the Canal Zone. My country expressed here its most fervent wish that nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of the successful fulfilment of this settlement  for it is a model of the type of solution possible when the work is not influenced by the arrogance of power.228.	My country also wishes  at this session of the United Nations General Assembly  to stress its concern over the universal spread of inflation  a scourge which is causing serious social and economic upheavals in the world. Accordingly  the international community must give it priority consideration-the more so since the swift spread of its effects is showing us that the measures adopted individually by States are not sufficient to tackle a problem which is eroding the economic life of nations and the orderly functioning of the world economy.229.	That is why I feel it timely to suggest to this Assembly that it consider the possibility of convening-as proposed by the President of Colombia during a recent meeting of the Heads of State of the Andean Pact countries held in Washington on 8 September 1911-a world conference on inflation. That conference could discuss inflation's complex causes and the mechanisms which cause it to spread and also adopt adequate global strategies to fight a problem of universal magnitude  worsened by the recent phenomenon whereby contemporary inflation coincides with high rates of unemployment.230.	On behalf of my fellow citizens  I renew here my last wishes to the General Assembly in its efforts to make true progress in the patient and difficult enterprise of filling the gaps left by inequalities among peoples  which are now testing the authority of the international Organization by multiplying the sources of conflict between States  continents and the various geographical and economic areas of the planet.231.	Colombia also hails the entry into the world Organization of such nations as Viet Nam and Djibouti  which will surely contribute their will to work for peace  as well as the valuable experience they have acquired in the course of their unremitting struggle to achieve independence. "
"30",1553,"COM",32,1977,"﻿211.	 May I be allowed first of all to express to the President my congratulations on his election to preside over the present session of our Assembly. My delegation is convinced that  thanks to his experience and competence  the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success. My delegation feels special satisfaction because of the links of friendship and close co-operation which exist between our countries and also because of our solidarity within the general framework of the non-aligned movement.212.	I  also take this opportunity to pay a tribute  to the outgoing President  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who showed so much competence in the honourable discharge of his responsibilities during the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.213.	Finally  on behalf of my Government  I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the efforts which he exerts continually to assist in the maintenance of peace  security and justice throughout the world. The re-election of that apostle of peace has reassured the oppressed peoples and those who struggle for just causes.214.	My country had the honour and privilege to be a sponsor of the resolutions on the admission of two new Members to this Organization: on the one hand  the Republic of Djibouti  which has the same colonial past as our country and with which we hope to maintain the best possible relations; on the other hand  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam which  after 30 years of heroic struggle  has emerged victorious and unified. I wish to offer them our congratulations and to welcome them to this great family of the United Nations.215.	We are also convinced that the peaceful reunification of Korea and its admission to this Organization will take place shortly.216.. It is customary  during the general debate in this Assembly  to review the problems which threaten world peace and security and the economic balance. While we discuss the outlines of those problems and the level of their interaction  each country feels itself obliged to express its views and propose solutions.217.	With regard to those problems  the Republic of the Comoros also wishes to make its modest contribution  commensurate with the means at our disposal.218.	Much has been humorously said about ""micro- States""  including the Comoros  with the concealed intention of showing to the international community that those States are not viable and are incapable of carrying out their national and international duties.219.	But in the Comoros we are deeply convinced that the only criterion which should be applied to assess the stature  efficiency and morality of States is the constant determination of those States to act day after day in conformity with the principles of the Charter.220.	Hence the respect which we feel for certain States and our judgement of them are not dependent on their economic might and still less on their military might; they depend rather on their will to assure peace  security and progress for mankind as expressed in their deeds.221.	That is why  in speaking of the liberation movements in Africa  the Middle East and elsewhere  my country unconditionally offers its support to all those peoples in their struggle to regain their dignity  their freedom and the enjoyment of their inalienable rights prescribed in our Charter.222.	The international community must support the action of the five front-line countries  the sacrifices of whose peoples need no further proof. We must support every initiative aimed at a just and acceptable solution of the problem of Zimbabwe.223.	In so far as the Anglo-American plan recognizes the legitimacy of the power of the majority in Zimbabwe and in so far as that plan demonstrates the determination of the United States and the United Kingdom to assume their respective responsibilities  the Republic of the Comoros considers that plan as an acceptable basis for negotiation.224.	But so long as Ian Smith and his repressive forces have not been put out of action  the international community must continue to give its moral and material support to the armed struggle in Zimbabwe.225.	If today  because of the harassment caused by the struggle for liberation and the diplomatic pressures exerted on Ian Smith  the settlement of the Zimbabwe problem can be considered to be very near  the same cannot be said about South Africa  where criminal repression against innocent black children is continuing. The Vorster regime is killing and torturing them. It is killing the Africans at Sharpeville  at Soweto and at other localities of South Africa. It is torturing men and women in dungeons that are quite similar to Hitler's concentration camps. A few weeks ago we learned with indignation that the Vorster Government  after having tortured the great and immortal African nationalist Steven Biko  had murdered him in cold blood in one of those dungeons. This is an abominable crime that the whole international community must unreservedly condemn.226.	Must we really recall to those who collaborate with and who  directly or indirectly  help the Vorster regime that they are sharing a heavy responsibility with Vorster in any act that is perpetrated against the black people of that country? Only a total embargo and a systematic boycott will compel Vorster to come to his senses.227.	This same Vorster recipe that we have just described was applied to the letter in Namibia  a Territory which he should have left once and for all by August 1976 and restored to the United Nations to make it possible for the Organization to hold free elections in the Territory.228.	We encourage the consultations of the five Western countries members of the Security Council that were undertaken within the framework of resolution 385 (1976) of the Security Council. However  we feel that no solution that does not reflect the views of the authentic representatives of the peoples involved-and in this case it is SWAPO-can bring about a viable solution in that country. Only the conditions proposed by SWAPO can truly guarantee genuine independence and a durable peace in Namibia.229.	With regard to the Middle East  the situation of ""no war  no peace""  which now obtains in that region  can only favour the annexionist and expansionist policy of Israel  which continues to defy international opinion by occupying Arab territories in an endeavour to modify to its advantage their demographic and geographic features and to destroy their Islamic culture. We must unreservedly condemn the Jewish settlements that were installed in the occupied Arab lands.230.	In seeking an equitable and just solution of this problem  we must necessarily associate the Palestine Liberation Organization with any discussion on t1 e Middle East  and any discussion must of necessity prod.- first  Israel's evacuation of the Arab territories occupied since 1967; secondly  the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland; thirdly  the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; and  fourthly  the recognition of the right of the Palestinians to return to their homes.231.	My delegation considers that the settlement of the problem of Cyprus must be based on respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  and non- alignment of that country and on the recognition of the legitimate rights and aspirations of both communities.232.	On 16 December 1971  the General Assembly adopted resolution 2832 (XXVI)  in which it declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. It has also asked the great Powers to begin immediate consultations with the coastal States of the Indian Ocean in order to put an end to the process of escalation and expansion of the military presence in that zone and to eliminate from the Indian Ocean all bases  military installations and logistic support services which could make it possible to introduce nuclear arms and weapons of massive destruction into the area  and also to put an end to any display of the military presence of the great Powers in the Indian Ocean as conceived within the context of the rivalry of the great Powers.233.	My country feels that it is high time to see to it that tangible steps should be taken to ensure that this resolution is scrupulously implemented. The adoption of such measures would really prove the will of the great Powers to achieve complete and general disarmament. Mankind would then be able to emerge from the torpor and the anguish that it now feels  and the developing countries  which would benefit from renewed and expanded international solidarity  would thus be able to contemplate the future of their peoples with tranquillity and optimism234.	Convinced of the interdependence of the economies of States  my country continues to believe that the great Powers and the economically developed countries must suppress their selfish national interests and consider the future of mankind as a whole because the developing countries cannot accept a situation where the third world must recognize a ceiling for their standard of living beyond which it cannot hope to aspire.235.	Let us now turn to the Comoros. For the second time  the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte is submitted for consideration by the Assembly. I do not want at this stage to open a debate that will take place in due course. I will simply confine myself to describing to the Assembly certain significant facts that will make it possible for us to outline the problem in its present form and also to forecast the future.236.	In order to do so  I must report to the Assembly on the recent developments  particularly with regard to the situation as it obtains in Mayotte itself. The situation that prevails in that island is most alarming. Everywhere  in the private as well as in the public sector  the Comorian citizen of Mayotte has no longer any responsibility. Public offices are reserved for staff brought in from the island of Reunion and for staff from France. In the private sector  there is an influx of businessmen who are mainly former colonial settlers with a nostalgic feeling for France's colonial empire. And as if to create an irreversible colonial situation  there are also posts of ""military surveillance"" that have been set up in the four corners of the island and which are all occupied by members of the Foreign Legion. The latter  the renegades of society  specialists in low tasks and depraved conduct  are today the real masters of the Comorian island of Mayotte.237.	This tendency to accelerate the military compartmentalization of the Comorian island of Mayotte carries with it the most nefarious consequences for the island. Even if 130 years of French colonization could not really impair true Comorian values  one must fear today that very soon those legionnaires  exerting pressure on a defenceless population and given free reign  will bring about a situation where the Comorian of Mayotte will lose his personality and become a pleasure-seeker of the lowest type  someone who has lost even his sense of dignity  his integrity and his freedom.238.	Special measures are taken to encourage the installation of the capitalist sector and the colonial circles in Mayotte through the free distribution of land belonging to the State  the purchase at ridiculous prices of lands belonging to the peasants and the expropriation of the commercial and tourist sector by these newcomers. In short  Mayotte has become the last refuge of colonialists who are seeking wealth with little effort and interesting and exciting adventures.239.	Finally  to conclude this chapter on the internal situation in the island of Mayotte  we must point to two facts which took place recently and which signify a further escalation in the process of the occupation of Mayotte. While the international community does not recognize France's competence in Mayotte and while the French presence in Mayotte has been censured most vehemently by the resolution that was adopted last year by this General Assembly  France none the less 15 days ago appointed Mr. Marcel Henri-the leader of the separatist movement on Mayotte—as a Senator of the French Republic in the French Senate.240.	From now on  in the case of the Comorian island of Mayotte  we must really impute the facts to those who bear full responsibility for them.241.	We must have the courage to denounce what we consider a most serious violation of international morality and of the legitimate rights which history  culture  the economy and law have always recognized as belonging to the Comorians. In this case France has violated its own Constitution  its own laws  its own regulations.242.	The French Constitution in its preamble states that France will respect the rules of international law. Among those rules  of course  there is also the Charter of the United Nations which has been signed both by France and the Comoros. Thus the first duty of States is to respect the principles which they have committed themselves to defend.243.	On the other hand  all pertinent French laws and regulations  from 1889 to 23 November 1974  which was the date when the French Parliament passed the law organizing a referendum regarding the accession of the Comoros to independence  have each time recognized the political unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros.244.	Because of Senegal's discreet mediation through the intermediary of its prestigious chief  President Leopold Sedar Senghor  two French missions went to the Comoros  one in December 1976  and the other in January 1977. Those two meetings held with the chief of the Comorian State  our brother Ali Soilih  led us to the painful realization that the position of France in this matter had not changed  despite all the appeals which were launched by the non-aligned countries in Colombo and also the appeals of the General Assembly of 21 October 1976.245.	The last action which shows the ill will of France in the matter is the suspension on 18 June last of the two flights of Air-Comoros  the national airline  over Mayotte.By this action  France has now severed the last direct economic link which had been preserved since our relations were broken off in December 1975  and France has widened the gap which separates the community of Comorian Mayotte from the rest of the archipelago246.	To this political situation  which is of much concern to the international community  we must also add the social and economic problems which are inherent in our situation  that of a developing country that has gained independence in exceptionally difficult circumstances  while a part of its territory is being occupied by a foreign Power.247.	The missions of the United Nations which went to the Comoros successively in December 1975 and in April and the beginning of September of this year have realized the poverty and the misery into which France has allowed the people of Comoros to sink.248.	In this year of 1977 there were two new catastrophes in the Comoros: one was due to the repatriation of 16 000 Comorians from Madagascar because of the distressing events in Majunga; the other to the eruption of a volcano which has completely destroyed an entire village and which has left over 5 000 people homeless.249.	Because of the help and solidarity offered by many countries and international organizations  the Comorian people somehow avoided complete catastrophe. But it is nonetheless a fact that we need the political support of Members of the United Nations to settle the problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte. We also need their financial assistance in order to begin our economic development.250.	In concluding — and this is in keeping with the action taken by the President of the Gabonese Republic  El Hadj Omar Bongo  who is the current President of the OAU-I want to say that our Government is always prepared to begin a dialogue with France. We have always stated that  and it is in this spirit that we shall approach the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte when it is discussed here."
"31",1593,"CPV",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  may we  in turn  congratulate you warmly on your election to preside over the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of our Organization. Yugoslavia  your country  with which the Republic of Cape Verde has friendly relations since the time of our struggle for national liberation  earned the appreciation of all peoples  not only because of its constant defence of the developing countries  but also  and more particularly  because of its militant action within the framework of the movement of non-aligned countries  to which we have the honour to belong. We are convinced that your qualities as a diplomat and statesman  as well as your experience in international affairs  will assist you greatly in the fulfilment of the high duties which have been unanimously conferred upon you and that you will spare no effort in order to guide our activities towards the positive results that we expect.2.	We should like also to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Amerasinghe  whose poise and competence do honour to his country  Sri Lanka. After having been a respected President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea he became an attentive President of the General Assembly.3.	It is also a matter of satisfaction to us to be able to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his unflagging dedication to the service of our Organization and to the cause of mankind and particularly because of the constant concern he has shown in seeking solutions to the problems that confront the peoples still under foreign domination and the developing countries in their struggle for progress.4.	At the present session we have had the pleasure of welcoming the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to our midst. Its bitter and determined struggle to achieve membership in the United Nations has done honour to that heroic people. Its stubborn struggle throughout its history against all forms of domination  its unflagging zeal for independence  and its determination to follow the line it has itself chosen  culminating last year in the unification of the country  have aroused the admiration of the international community and given an example of courage and dignity to the peoples of the world.5.	We also wish to greet the people of Djibouti  who  with the support of Africa and of the forces that love peace and justice  have been able always to hold high the torch of freedom and independence and to fight effectively to overcome the obstacles that have been placed in their way.6.	The presence of these two sovereign countries among us in the United Nations is a further proof of the march of history towards progress and the irreversible liberation of the peoples.7.	A year ago  from this very same rostrum  we said that if we wanted to be quite fair we could not but note the enormous progress that had been achieved in the fulfilment of the objectives laid down in the Charter of the United Nations.8.	We also said that we were undoubtedly witnessing a positive effort to establish understanding and co-operation among nations  and that this would encourage all initiatives for the achievement of international detente.9.	In the meantime  we wish to voice our concern at flagrant violations of fundamental human rights  at efforts to perpetuate the anachronistic colonialist  racist regimes of apartheid  at acts of aggression  interference and violation of the territorial integrity of sovereign States and at subversive manoeuvres tending to destabilize lawful Governments  all of which constitute a threat to international peace and security.10.	Today  while we note that a certain amount of evolution has taken place and that more realistic attitudes are being taken with respect to some questions  a development which we welcome with a sense of relief  the concerns to which we have alluded remain and the progress achieved seems insubstantial.11.	In Africa we see that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of several countries can be violated  in defiance of international morality and law  by mercenaries in the pay of obscure forces that still try to perpetuate retrograde systems in our continent.12.	We note that the process of decolonization still under way or recently completed may be jeopardized by real attempts at colonial reconquest  which create situations intolerable both to the persons concerned and to the credibility and honour of this Organization.13.	In southern Africa important events are in preparation as the struggle of the peoples of the region gathers momentum and new prospects open up to the national liberation movements in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.14.	The grave situation that now prevails in that area of the world because of the intransigence of the racist regimes and the various manoeuvres they engage in with a view to arresting or diverting the process under way cannot be successfully or finally resolved unless the just demands and aspirations of the peoples fighting for a life of dignity  justice and peace are satisfied.15.	The attempts by some Member States to find a peaceful way of transferring power from the minority to the majority  is yet another effort to find solutions to the problems created by the racist regimes. But it does not seem that either Salisbury or Pretoria is really prepared to listen to the language of peace and reason.16.	The recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity reaffirmed the legitimacy of the armed struggle  still the only way for those under racist domination to achieve their aspirations. Thus there can be no doubt that the armed struggle is a determining factor in the liberation of the peoples of southern Africa and we have always supported the national liberation movements determined to achieve true independence for their peoples.17.	The front-line Member States are constantly subjected to direct provocation and acts of aggression by the racist regimes. We wish to pay them a heartfelt tribute for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of Africa and in defence of the principles of the United Nations  for the dignified attitude they have taken  for their courage and their responsible behaviour  and for the example they are giving of African unity in the face of the dangers that threaten the continent.18.	Praiseworthy efforts are now being made to secure by peaceful means the objectives of the peoples of Zimbabwe in their continuing struggle for national liberation.19.	We must recognize that the progress achieved so far would not have been possible without the impetus given it by the Patriotic Front  without the important work done by the front-line States  without the solidarity consistently shown by independent Africa and without the pressure of international public opinion  which every day is increasing the isolation of the racist minorities in power.20.	We welcome the efforts made thus far and the measures taken by the United Nations. We confidently hope that the parties directly concerned will continue to make a sincere contribution to the effective transfer of power from the minority to a majority capable of guaranteeing the realization of the basic aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe for peace  progress and social justice.21.	In Namibia we know that a grave situation is being perpetuated mainly because of the maintenance of the illegal South African administration in the Territory. We must thwart the manoeuvres of the racist South African regime in the Territory and reaffirm that no negotiations can lead Namibia to independence unless they take into account the pre-conditions set out by the South West Africa People's Organization  the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people recognized by the United Nations and the OAU.22.	The aggressive racist regime that afflicts South Africa tries desperately to disguise its misdeeds both within and outside its territory. However  the heroic resistance of the South African people  mobilized by the national liberation movements  continues to grow in the teeth of institutionalized terrorism  the legalized violation of human rights and the ceaseless massacre of defenceless civilians and thus brings closer the inevitable downfall of that bastion of racism and colonialism in our continent.23.	The international community has noted the heinous nature of the apartheid system and the Bantustan policy  and has taken action to increase the isolation of that regime  which continues with impunity to flout the fundamental principles of our Organization. We believe that in the present circumstances we must help the victims of the system of apartheid to organize them better and to resist the multiple attacks on their lawful rights. Therefore we must help the liberation movements to create the conditions and acquire the material means needed for the development of their struggle for freedom. We consider these to be decisive measures which will enable them to achieve the sacred objectives which they have set themselves  objectives which are also shared by the United Nations.24.	We are compelled to note that the same concern and the same tensions persist in other regions of Africa.25.	In the Comoros efforts have been made and missions have been sent by the OAU to find a solution to the problem of the island of Mayotte  which is still occupied and still separated from the Comoros as a whole. A just solution which will preserve the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of a Member of the United Nations family must be found in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU.26.	In the Middle East the evolution of the situation and the most recent events lead us to reaffirm our conviction that no solution or arrangement which does not take due account of the aspirations and national rights of the martyred and heroic people of Palestine can be satisfactory or lasting but will on the contrary only exacerbate the present situation. In fact  the question of Palestine is the corner-stone of my just solution of the problem of the Middle East.27.	The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people to regain their homeland  decide their own future and build an independent State are sacred rights recognized by the international community. We reaffirm once more our whole-hearted support of the Palestinian people in their struggle  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  and of the Arab countries which are striving to recover their occupied territories.28.	The situation in East Timor continues to concern the Members of our Organization because of the existence in that Territory of a situation of fait accompli that is denying to an entire people its right to self-determination and independence. Everything must be done to ensure that foreign troops withdraw from East Timor  thus ending at last the sufferings of its people  who are struggling stubbornly and with determination to end the illegal occupation of their country.29.	We cannot pass over in silence the injustice of the existing economic order. We note with great apprehension  on the basis of the analysis of the existing data that the gap which separates the industrialized countries from the developing countries is widening. Despite all the efforts to establish a more just international economic order-and in this connexion we pay a tribute to this Assembly for its efforts-real progress has been meagre. In drawing up a balance-sheet of these efforts we would recall in particular the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  at which the problems were correctly set out and the relevant objectives defined  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  and the bilateral meetings which took place between the representatives of the African  Caribbean and Pacific group of States and those of the members of the European Common Market.30.	Unfortunately all those efforts  although well- intentioned  failed to achieve the desired practical results.31.	In this same category of problems belongs the question of the ownership and use of marine resources. The technological ability of the developed countries can be played as a trump card against that of the developing countries. In so far as the development hopes of some countries are directed towards this possible new source of resources it is desirable that there be true understanding of the problems and a serious willingness to co-operate  instead of a commitment to competitive activity to the flagrant disadvantage of the underprivileged countries.32.	The most unjust aspect of this inequality in the relations between the two groups of countries  the industrialized and the developing  is that the former enjoy substantial surpluses while the latter suffer grave shortages of all necessary goods. If we do not ensure a rational use of the goods produced by man  and if there is not a sincere desire to make concessions and to join together to assist development by measures that include the transfer of technology  the years ahead look anything but encouraging to the developing countries.33.	In fact  both development and under-development have their laws  which combine in the present situation to increase a little more each day the wealth of the one and the poverty of the other. We are certain that the international community will be able to put the problem in its true economic and-above all-political perspective and  under the auspices of our Organization  to adopt the measures necessary for the establishment of economic relations more in conformity with universal morality and conscience.34.	We also feel it our duty to say to this Assembly that the international community must give serious consideration to the disarmament problem. While it is true that considerable efforts and some progress have been made in preventing the unregulated proliferation of nuclear weapons  the appearance of ever more deadly and sophisticated weapons  which stimulate the arms race  is cause for concern.35.	The international community must strive for the neutralization of weapons of mass destruction and range itself determinedly on the side of peaceful coexistence  harmony among nations  and the use of the conquests of science and technology to promote the well-being and progress of the peoples.36.	Many other subjects will be dealt with in the course of this session  for there are many items on the agenda  and they deserve the attention of this Assembly. We shall speak on these subjects at the appropriate time. Nevertheless we felt we must reaffirm our total support for all just causes and  in particular  for all national liberation struggles aimed at liberating man from all forms of subjection.37.	We take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the international community  through the representatives of the free and sovereign nations present here  the grave economic situation which the Republic of Cape Verde still faces and which was described in all its harsh and cruel reality to this Assembly a year ago.38.	At a time when concerted efforts are being made to find ways of achieving a better use of the water resources of the world  and when there is a growing awareness of the serious consequences of desertification for such countries as ours  we cannot pass over in silence the real difficulties with which we are faced through the persistence of the scourge of drought in the Sahelian region  which affects us in particular.39.	Still suffering in the ninth consecutive year of drought  the people of Cape Verde  who depend almost entirely on agriculture  are determined to continue sparing no effort in pursuit of the objectives of national reconstruction set out in our Government's programme and are preparing themselves courageously for another year of crisis. Tremendous problems beset the life of the young Republic of Cape Verde and the international community is making an undeniable contribution to their solution. But we are not weakened in our determination  stated to this Assembly at the last session of the General Assembly  to continue on the road  increasingly rocky of late  to independence of thought and action and the unwavering application of the principles that have guided our relations with other Members of this family of sovereign States.40.	We are increasingly convinced that  by espousing the principles of non-alignment  non-aggression  non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  and peaceful coexistence and by supporting peoples struggling for national liberation against all forms of subjection  we are serving the noble ideals of the United Nations and are truly defending fundamental human rights. "
"32",1637,"CRI",32,1977,"﻿137.	 May I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. It is a just recognition of your great merits as a diplomat and a political leader of your country. It is also a well-deserved tribute to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  whose enlightened foreign policy has contributed to world peace and better understanding among nations.138.	The Osimo agreements  which have just been ratified by the Parliaments of Yugoslavia and Italy  constitute genuine proof of that enlightened foreign policy of your country  Mr. President. A satisfactory solution has thus been found for the Trieste question which for so many years was a vexed question on the agenda of our sessions.139.	I also wish to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe  in addition to the many other congratulations he has received  for the brilliant manner in which he guided the debates of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.140.	As in past years  the report submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  is an invaluable document. The observations contained in it will enlighten us as to the proper course to take in guiding the work of this Assembly.141.	My delegation wishes most cordially to welcome the two new Members of our Organization: the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The entry of the former is yet another step in the advance of the policy of decolonization  to which the United Nations has contributed so much. The reunification of Viet Nam and its admission as a new State Member of the United Nations leaves behind painful  but superseded  memories of a cruel war which  for more than two decades  afflicted that heroic nation.142.	My country has followed with interest and concern the development of events in southern Africa  where the gravest situations of colonialism and racial discrimination prevail.143.	The consultations held on Rhodesia by Mr. Owen  the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom  and Mr. Young of the United States are a positive quest for a peaceful transition in that nation so as to arrive at the desired goal of a majority Government in an independent Zimbabwe. My delegation expresses its appreciation for those endeavours and supports the proposals for an agreement on Rhodesia. It is our hope that a negotiated solution cm by peaceful means break the stubborn obstinacy of the minority and in the nearest possible future establish a democratic regime based on the principle of majority rule 144.	As regards the situation in Namibia  I must state once again that my delegation considers that South Africa's permanent and flagrant mockery of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council constitutes the most striking defiance of United Nations decisions ever witnessed. Costa Rica renews its support for every effort leading to the independence of Namibia and expresses its solidarity with the long-suffering people of that nation.145.	I also wish to reiterate most energetically the permanent condemnation by my country of the policy of apartheid practised by the Government of South Africa and all other forms of racial discrimination. This irrevocable position of Costa Rica against apartheid is one of longstanding and is fully in force because the ignominy of discrimination is totally alien to Costa Rican sense of freedom  democratic practices  equality and respect for human rights.146.	From the beginning of the United Nations the Middle East conflict has held a prominent place on the agenda of every session of the General Assembly  thus confirming the importance which the international community attaches to that matter  as well as its inability so far to find a lasting solution.147.	My delegation has invariably maintained that Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  supplemented by resolution 338 (1973) of the same Council  contains all the principles necessary for a peaceful solution of the problem. Indeed  implicit in those resolutions we find three basic elements for peace in the Middle East: first  the existence of the State of Israel within secure and recognized boundaries; secondly  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories occupied during the 1967 war; and thirdly  recognition and practical application of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including the right to live in peace within a State of their own  independent or federated.148.	Regrettably  it has not been possible to implement those resolutions  because attempts have been made to destroy their harmonious balance by priority application of paragraphs which favour one or more of the parties and the indefinite postponement of paragraphs which favour the opposite party or parties. A formula must therefore be sought to ensure the simultaneous application of the resolutions in their entirety so as to do justice and instil confidence in all the parties involved in the conflict.149.	That is the task which  as provided for in resolution 338(1973)  the Geneva Peace Conference which  unfortunately  has only held preliminary meetings in December 1973  must accomplish. The atmosphere of moderation that prevailed at the beginning of this year  together with the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Waldheim  and the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Vance  encouraged the hope that the Geneva Conference would meet again in the next few months  with a good opportunity to do positive work. Nevertheless  disagreement regarding Palestinian representation at the Conference and the manner of the Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied during she six-day war has weakened the hopes for an early and fruitful Conference.150.	It is to be hoped that these obstacles will be overcome in a search for formulas which can bring agreement on and ensure Palestinian representation at the Geneva Conference  with recognition of the irreversible legal existence of Israel  and that in turn those formulas will  on the other hand  provide for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied areas in such a way as to leave Israel with only the territory that is indispensable if its boundaries are to be defensible.151.	With the same frankness with which we have defended the legitimate rights of Israel to an independent and peaceful existence and condemned aberrations such as those equating Zionism with racism  today we state that my delegation does not support the annexation of territory for reasons of religious dogmatism or historical romanticism. My delegation also affirms that the recognition and legalization of Israeli settlements in the occupied areas  whatever their legal status  leads to the interpretation of such actions as an attempt by Israel to consolidate the occupation of those territories for annexation purposes. That would imply open contradiction of paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which  I repeat  we consider to be the best instrument for arriving at a just peace in the Middle East.152.	In each of the seven statements which I have made since 1970 in the general debate which takes place annually in this Assembly I have spoken in favour of the legitimate claims of Panama to the Canal. In each of those statements I maintained the need to abrogate the obsolete and unjust Panama Canal Treaty of 1903. In every statement I expressed the support of Costa Rica for the Panamanian position on the need to replace the 1903 Treaty by other treaties which  while guaranteeing the neutrality of the Canal and its continued operation for the benefit of all nations  would grant Panama growing participation in the administration of the operating enterprise and in its benefits. Above all  I advocated that as soon as possible the last vestige of a colonialist enclave  which has kept the territory of the Republic of Panama divided  should disappear.153.	The treaties signed by the United States and Panama on 7 September 1977 fulfilled those major objectives. They are the result of 13 years of laborious negotiations which seemed as though they would never end. They mark the beginning of the end of an era  offering tangible proof of a new political style in the United States. They are a gesture which proves the joint goodwill of two peoples prepared harmoniously to end a serious conflict.154.	What is still lacking is ratification by the Senate of the United States of America and approval by the citizens of Panama by means of a plebiscite. There cannot be much doubt about the favourable result of the Panamanian referendum but  on the other hand  some apprehension exists regarding the affirmative vote which has to be cast by at least 67 of the 100 United States Senators.155.	To redress this historical political abuse represented by the imposition of the 1903 Treaty is an indispensable act of international justice which only a bold and brave Government  as that of President Carter  could dare to undertake in defiance of North American public opinion  which is indifferent or adverse because it is erroneously or maliciously informed. A calm and objective assessment by the international community would assist in illustrating for the North Americans how just is the Panamanian cause in comparison with what they thought was a legitimate enterprise and what  from the point of view of technical ingenuity  was in fact a magnificent piece of work.156.	The peoples of the American hemisphere demonstrated their solidarity with Panama when their highest dignitaries went to Washington on 7 September this year as very special witnesses to the historic act of the signing of the new treaties.157.	It is to be hoped that this Assembly  in the name of all the peoples represented here  will also make manifest its support for the agreements which the Administration of the United States reached with the Government of Panama. This would convince the Congress of the United States that these treaties were negotiated not with only a small and weak nation but with a people which  because of the justice of its cause  has the full support of the international community.158.	In his report this year the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  puts these crucial questions: What... is the real position of the United Nations in the affairs of the world? Is it really a central element in the foreign policies of most Governments?  159.	My delegation endorses the important considerations advanced by our Secretary-General in regard to those questions and  in a desire to assist his deliberation  I would venture to add the following comments.160.	The United Nations is in itself three different institutions which nevertheless form one whole  and each is of immense value to Member States.161.	First of all  the United Nations is a world forum for debate  a centre for publicity  education and persuasion  a place where weak nations can advocate their causes as freely as the- strong nations. This aspect of the United Nations has been used by its enemies to denigrate our Organization  when in a derogatory manner they call it a  debating society  or a  cave of the winds . But those who make these criticisms only prove their lack of knowledge of the value of debate in an open society. My delegation maintains that  in the long run  free debate works against error and for truth and justice. Those who deplore broad debate in the forums of the United Nations seem to have little confidence in the capacity of their respective countries successfully to present their good causes.162.	Secondly  the United Nations is a place for negotiation  a kind of permanent diplomatic gathering where the peaceful solution of disputes can be sought behind the scenes. The United Nations provides a permanent place where the representatives of 149 sovereign States can meet informally  whether in the corridors and conference rooms  at banquets and receptions  or in friendly talks in the Delegates' Lounge. Furthermore  the United Nations provides a framework in which this quiet diplomacy among nations in conflict can be initiated and moderated by the presence of a third person  the Secretary-General of the United Nations or any one of his representatives.163.	Thirdly  but not finally  the United Nations is a centre for international action  an Instrument for making things happen instead of merely talking about them. One part of this action is connected with promoting the well-being of nations through the implementation of economic and social plans. This function is  by far  the largest in terms of money and staff  and it is far less controversial than the United Nations action in the political and military fields  although of course this action is not free from vehement controversy either. The other aspect of the United Nations as an instrument of action is the wide; range of activities undertaken to maintain peace throughout the world. Here we emphasize the diplomatic efforts of the Secretary-General's office in mediation  conciliation  observation and investigation before and during conflicts. Beyond the activities of the Secretariat there are the peace-keeping operations  which include the use of numerous troops  such as those which participated and sacrificed their lives in Korea  the Middle East  the Congo and Cyprus.164.	The growing effectiveness of all these three institutions which constitute the Organization depends or. international co-operation. This co-operation does not come about spontaneously. It is not merely an ideal  a principle  a desire ; r a policy. It is represented by institutions  by treaties  by laws  by negotiations  by agreements and by actions. Finally  it is made up of concrete elements which are frequently difficult to bring into being.165.	Peace is not an abstraction. It requires an organized system for the peaceful settlement of disputes among nations and peaceful change in internal structures. The alternative to nuclear weapons is not their mere suppression. The alternative resides in the existence of efficient and trustworthy institutions that will guarantee the security of all nations.166.	During the first 30 years of the United Nations there was a tendency to define the struggle for freedom as being similar to a struggle for national independence. But we well know that history is full of sad examples of tyrannies that have tried to justify themselves by their nationalism. Now that so many new nations have at last attained their national liberation  we must face the prior question of what happens to the individual freedom of men  women and children  the freedom of every human being whose value and dignity is affirmed on the first page of the United Nations Charter? Today  obviously  the world gives a very unsatisfactory reply to this question.167.	Experience has demonstrated the close interdependence existing between human rights  on the one hand  and international peace and security  on the other. The recent history of nazism in power should have taught us all that the suppression of internal freedoms is the instrument of external aggression  that a domestic lack of respect for human dignity can rapidly lead to the crushing of human dignity abroad. Dictators have always used international adventures as pretexts for consolidating the subjugation of their own peoples. And the danger of their external policies is made all the greater by the systematic suppression of domestic dissidence.168.	The other side of the coin is also less deplorable. The more a country is threatened by external aggression  the less opportunity exists for the observance of human rights within that country.169.	Those who are concerned with preserving and developing human rights in free societies must  then  also be concerned with promoting human rights in the rest of the world  and those who are concerned with promoting international peace and security cannot be satisfied with the attainment of those objectives in their own countries alone. As was eloquently asked by President Kennedy in 1963   is not peace ultimately and basically a question of human rights?  170.	Just as the promotion of human rights has a universal character  as is recognized and emphasized by the United Nations Charter  it must also be approached universally and simultaneously and be applied to every sphere of human activity. If it is recognized that a man cannot be truly free under .mi arbitrary Government  it must also be recognized that neither can ho he free -even if freedom is proclaimed by the constitution and laws of his country he is subject to the oppression of poverty or the tyranny of ignorance.171.	For a human being to have dignity   e mast have at least a minimum number of rights  which must be simultaneously applicable: the right to life  to freedom of thought and opinion  to equality  to economic well-being  to education  to equitable remuneration when working and to fraternal treatment from the other members of society.172.	In reaction to the Jack of social solidarity which characterized he capitalist in the first half of our century  today there is greater insistence upon economic and social human rights than upon purely civil and political rights.173.	This emphasis can be explained and accepted as long as it is not used as an excuse to suppress civil and political rights for the sake of economic and social development  which in fact does not require the suppression of other rights.174.	Obviously  economic and social rights require that they be enjoyed by all  that the nation should have the financial and technical resources which only development can provide. That in why the under-developed countries have great difficulty in making human rights effective in the economic and social fields. It is a grave fact that in many cases  in order to overcome the obstacles presented by under-development  it is considered necessary to do without civil and political rights as well. Thus the peoples of many developing countries are not only cast into the abyss of economic wretchedness  ill health  servile labour  ignorance and under nourishment but must also bear arbitrariness and oppression from those who rule them.175.	The solution  therefore  is not to suppress some rights for the sake of others. The solution is progressively and simultaneously to move forward towards full effectiveness for all rights. That is why international co-operation for development  like respect for human rights  has ceased to be an internal obligation and has become a great international duty.176.	Only when the rich States really comply with their obligation to co-operate with the poor in their efforts to overcome under-development can they rightfully call for full observance of human rights.177.	On the other hand  my delegation is convinced that repression set up as a rule of government is not only a violation of the United Nations Charter  which requires respect for human rights  but also creates major obstacles to the attainment of socio-economic progress by the subjugated peoples. Such repression prevents the full participation of the people without which no process of socio-economic development can be successful  whatever may be the prevailing system. That is why under-development and political repression are but aspects of one and the same problem.178.	The delegation of Costa Rica attaches special importance to agenda item 76 of this session of the Assembly  entitle  alternative approaches and ways and means within the United Nations system for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.179.	Together with other delegations which share our interests  my delegation has participated in the drafting of an informal working paper which explains the approach given to the item and an initial draft which brings up to date and includes our old idea of establishing a post entitled United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.180.	The coming into being of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)]  the two International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocol of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have given legal content to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those instruments have conferred new functions on the United Nations  functions which should  in the opinion of my delegation  be co-ordinated and promoted by an agency of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.181.	The need for such an agency  rejected by an impartial official having objective authority  has become more obvious because of the tendency to create ad hoc committees to investigate selectively certain cases of alleged violations of human rights with a predominantly political criterion  a criterion which casts doubt on the equity of the conclusions and recommendations that might be arrived at by such ad hoc committees. A High Commissioner would  on the contrary  have the prestige arising from his impartiality and broad knowledge of the subject and would be heeded because his good offices and recommendations would be objective and removed from the urge to provoke a political scandal in the country against which it is rightly or wrongly alleged that violations of human rights have occurred.180. My Government hopes that at this thirty-second session there will finally be a full and dispassionate consideration of the sincere desire of my delegation and many others that there be established the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The support given to this idea by President Carter when he first appeared in this forum on 17 March 1977 and the voices of encouragement we have heard from other delegations have led us to request of the General Assembly that it at least earn out an exhaustive consideration of the matter.181. The primary goal of the United Nations is to promote international peace and security. That goal logically becomes more distant in inverse ratio to the increase in the number and destructive capacity of nuclear and conventional weapons.182.	The statistics on weapons are truly terrifying. The data of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute indicate that mankind has accumulated the equivalent of more than a million Hiroshima bombs. That represents a lethal potential capable of annihilating the total population of the world 12 times over. And yet the number of nuclear warheads for guided missiles continues to increase from year to year  and in the last eight years they have increased fivefold. At the same time  the lethal capacity of conventional weapons which  unlike clear weapons  are available even to the poorest countries of the world is being perfected.183.	These facts demonstrate that the human race is lagging behind in its race against weapons. Increasingly vigorous efforts are required to achieve disarmament  or at least a reduction in armaments.184.	We do not deny the right of every country to be vigilant with respect to its own security. The truth is that many countries have recourse to weapons because the international community regrettably has so far not been able to offer an international substitute for the duty of each State to see to its own security.185.	It might be said that as an exception Costa Rica wishes to offer the testimony of its confidence in the present agreements on collective  regional and world security to which it is a party. Therefore  inspired by its age-old civilian tradition  we decided in 1948 to dissolve our armed forces and refrain from investing funds in acquiring the instruments of war. That act of faith has yielded optimum dividends. My country has been able to allocate for the health  education  housing and nutrition of its people the inevitably scarce resources which others allocate for instruments of war. That is perhaps why our democracy is today sounder than it has ever been and why our citizens live with decorum  in freedom and dignity. "
"33",1683,"CSK",32,1977,"﻿161.	Comrade President  I have already taken the opportunity of congratulating you personally from this rostrum and of expressing our satisfaction at the fact that we are working under your experienced leadership. I have also had the opportunity to welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti upon their admission to membership in the United Nations. I should like too to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  upon his re-election to his high post and to wish him further creative success in his responsible work at the head of our Organization. I wish also to associate myself with the gratitude expressed to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for the work that he did at the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly.162.	While expressing the views of the Czechoslovak Government  I should like  along with other speakers here  to express my satisfaction at the fact that in so far as concerns the development of international relations  we believe that the past year has been a period of a continued deepening of the trend towards detente  which is the paramount task of all those who cherish peace. We can all take pleasure in the fact that the idea of detente has been penetrating the consciousness of people ever more deeply and has become a phenomenon that promotes the solution of urgent international problems-a material force acting in the interests of peace and security  for the benefit of the economic  social and cultural development of mankind.163.	That is why this reality finds a place in a particularly topical context  that of an event that is undoubtedly the most significant ii the history of mankind  namely  the Great October Socialist Revolution  the sixtieth anniversary of which we shall soon be commemorating. Its fundamental foreign policy orientation  embodied in Lenin's Decree on Peace  the very first document of the Revolution  the master-plan of the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems  is in direct line of cause and effect with the principles which have today found their objective reflection in the policy of detente.164.	It is undoubtedly remarkable that it is precisely those principles-of the solution of international problems by negotiations  and of the search for the most effective forms of mutually advantageous co-operation and means of safeguarding real human rights—which today constitute the principal objectives of the activities of the United Nations.165.	Indeed  the October Revolution shattered the old social structures and gave birth to the first State in the world which from its very founding guaranteed fundamental human rights  a State in which the voice of the working people has been the decisive force and in which genuine equality and justice prevail. This fundamentally new historical experiment provided inspiration for the rest of the world  had a revolutionary effect on the development of mankind and led to the liberation of nations  to the collapse of the colonial system and to an unprecedented upsurge of democracy and social progress. The basic principles of that policy are fully reflected in the draft of the new Constitution of the Soviet Union and will be embodied therein as the supreme law of the Soviet State.166.	That peaceful policy is of profound interest to Czechoslovakia  the founding of which was directly influenced by the great October Revolution.  We have always proceeded and will continue to proceed from the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems   said the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Republic  Gustav Husak  at the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He went on to say. In our time  when the means of destruction have been accumulated in huge quantities in the world  that is the only acceptable alternative. This policy is not only in keeping with the vital interests of the peoples of the socialist countries  but also with the interests of the peoples of the whole world. 167.	In our view  this policy  which is based on and oriented towards mutually advantageous co-operation and the search for universally acceptable solutions to problems  as well as strict observance of the principles of equality  non-interference in internal affairs  the universal application of the most-favoured-nation clause in economic relations and the elimination of any discrimination for political or other reasons  encourages the further rapprochement of peoples and countries  enhances the democratization of international relations  strengthens the circulation of the blood in the world organism of peace and opens up entirely new possibilities not only in the political sphere but also in the sphere of the exchange of scientific and cultural values. It contributes to the solution of problems of the protection of the human environment  the rational utilization of energy and food resources and other vital questions of today's world. In other words  detente means renouncing threats and coercion and embarking on the road of co-operation.168.	If the paramount task of the United Nations lies in the strengthening of world peace and international security  then it is we  the representatives of its Member States  who are to a considerable extent responsible for the performance of that task.169.	It is therefore not so much our task in this important forum to prove to each other the need for peace  that is  to preach to the converted  but rather  on the basis of a profound analysis  to come to agreement as to what effective  active and constructive measures are necessary to achieve that goal.170.	In considering these questions we should proceed with a sense of great responsibility  soberly and rationally  from the generally known and objective data  from the structure of the world today  from its political spectrum  relationship of forces  trends and perspectives.171.	In that context we should definitely take into account the fact that on our planet a community exists without which it is impossible to resolve any world problem today. That is the community of the socialist countries  which people no longer try to describe as a kind of historical misunderstanding or historical anomaly. That attempt has been given up even by those who have been making it for so many years.172.	Thanks to those countries  a correlation of forces has evolved in the world today which cannot be changed either by means of the intimidation characteristic of the times of the cold war nor by the use of tactics to obtain cheap advantages  nor even by means of new types of weapons. Therefore  all those who intend to act in that way or who are already doing so should remember that the countries of socialism today represent a powerful community  whose power and success are constantly growing  a community which enjoys tremendous influence and is sufficiently strong to ward off any threat or any blackmail. And those who think differently and fall back on the use of old methods must understand that such a policy is doomed to failure  because a completely different correlation of forces exists in the world today and an entirely different climate from that which existed  for example  20 years ago. Those opponents of detente are harming not only the cause of peace but their own peoples  as they lead them deeper and deeper into the maelstrom of the devaluation of currencies  inflation  unemployment and the constantly increasing economic difficulties for which  of course  they themselves are responsible.173.	It follows logically  therefore  from all this that only through joint efforts on the part of us all shall we be able  as we believe we can  in the future to eliminate potential sources of fatal military conflicts and to take preventive measures against the emergence of new ones.174.	In this forum the great significance for peace of the Final Act of the European Conference on Security and Co-operation has been stressed many times. The two years which have elapsed since it was signed have shown that security in Europe has been strengthened  that an atmosphere is being created conducive to complementing political relaxation by relaxation in the military sphere and to the further development of equal and mutually advantageous co-operation. All this demonstrates the durability  viability and soundness of that policy.175.	Czechoslovakia  a country in the heart of Europe  one of the few situated directly on the border between two worlds with different social systems  is particularly sensitive to the political situation in Europe. That is why we say this with a full sense of responsibility.176.	However  the new quality of international relations emerging in the process of detente requires now not only general declarations but new  constructive action. We are therefore entitled to expect that the responsible leaders of Western countries will display the necessary statesmanship and foresight in the interest of increasing the results in this basic sphere of human rights-the right to life  the right to peace and the right to international security.177.	Our Government pays constant attention to the serious and comprehensive implementation of the results of the Helsinki Conference. We have never viewed the Final Act of that Conference as something abstract; we welcomed it as the result of the positive changes in relations among European countries  as an exceptionally important international document creating a reliable and peaceful basis for a long-term  mutually advantageous development of relations among States  as an important bulwark of the present structure of international relations in the world in general and as an over-all programme of co-operation in the political  economic and humanitarian fields.178.	We whole-heartedly support the proposals by the Soviet Union relating to the expansion of all-European co-operation in a number of important fields. A good start could be made in this by a conference on co-operation in such vital fields as energy  transport and the protection of the environment.179.	We trust that this document will be approached in the same manner by all those who today are sitting around the negotiating table in Belgrade in order to discuss what further action should be taken and how to ensure that the spirit of Helsinki will continue to be the prevailing factor in the formation of relations among States on the European continent.180.	My country - as a firm element in the socialist system  gives pride of place to the all-round development of fraternal relations and co-operation with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. Our co-operation and closely co-ordinated joint action within the framework of the Warsaw Treaty and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is expanding and deepening  and this contributes towards the further strengthening of security  economic prosperity  culture and living standards of our people. The constantly growing strength and power of the countries of the socialist community has become an important factor in the stabilization of relations throughout Europe.181.	With regard to the bilateral relations of my country  I should like to point out with satisfaction that in the period that has elapsed since the last session of the United Nations General Assembly we have expanded and deepened fruitful and useful contacts with a large number of countries with different social systems. We have developed broad contacts  primarily in the political sphere  as reflected in the negotiations  visits and exchanges of view that have been held at all levels  including the highest level. Such positive developments took place in our relations with Finland  France  Turkey  Denmark  Belgium  the United Kingdom Greece  Cyprus  the Vatican  Portugal  Iceland  Spain and other countries.182.	We have made some progress also in the development of our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and we are ready to make further progress in that direction. In a word  we want to enjoy good neighbourly relations between our two countries. The same can be said also in relation to another of our neighbours  Austria. We are striving to develop good mutual relations with that country. We want to deepen those relations on the basis of equality  mutual respect and non-interference.183.	There have been favourable developments in our relations with Canada  something which unfortunately we cannot say of our relations with the United States of America  because of issues which still remain unresolved through no fault of ours. However  if the United States of America demonstrates the appropriate willingness and makes the necessary efforts  we are fully prepared to develop equal and mutually advantageous relations with that country too.184.	In the course of this active dialogue with the countries signatories of the Final Act we held dozens of specialized consultations. We made progress in our legal contractual relations on a bilateral basis with the majority of these countries and concluded with them some 50 agreements. Our cultural relations now exist on the basis of the agreements  protocols and programmes of exchange with 22 countries which signed the Final Act.185.	In a word  the Final Act is an extremely important document and we have regarded it as a source of momentum and initiative which directs the signatory countries further to deepen and broaden their mutual co-operation  thus confirming the familiar truth that the fundamental cell of the complex process of international relations is to be found in bilateral relations  which are an irreplaceable supplement to multilateral relations.186.	Czechoslovakia  which before winning its independence for so many centuries fought against foreign oppression  whole-heartedly shares the aspirations of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. We provide consistent support to developing countries fighting for their political independence and striving for economic development and social progress. Our country has a sincere interest in the strengthening of mutual trust and co-operation with these countries in all spheres of common interest.187.	We ascribe great significance to the role of the movement of non-aligned countries  which are striving actively for the freedom and independence of nations in their struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism. We welcome the fact that these countries consider it useful and objectively necessary for the process of detente to become a universal and dominant factor in international relations in all continents. We believe that this idea will be fully supported at the forthcoming meeting of non-aligned countries in Havana.188.	However  imperialist circles are not interested in the stability of international relations. By causing conflicts among young independent States they try to destroy the unity of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist front. That is why we support and shall continue to support in the future efforts designed to strengthen further the cooperation and co-operative action of the developing countries. We are convinced that there is no question that cannot be resolved peacefully by means of negotiations.189.	The Czechoslovak Government shares the view that the time is not far off when the last remnants of colonialism  racism and apartheid  those abhorrent blemishes on the face of mankind  will be liquidated once and for all and will disappear as a shameful political anachronism and an intolerable legacy of the past.190.	Czechoslovakia has always supported and will continue to support resolutely the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia in their just struggle for freedom and independence. Attempts to put forward a settlement of the problem of southern Africa which would satisfy only the racist minority regimes contain potential dangers of conflicts and new sources of tension.191.	We categorically condemn the policy of apartheid pursued by the Republic of South Africa and fully support the decisions adopted at the World Conference for Action Against Apartheid held recently in Lagos.192.	Reports that preparations are under way in the Republic of South Africa for the production of nuclear weapons are alarming because this represents a potential threat not only to the peoples of Africa but to world peace in general. We are in favour of the adoption of resolute measures to prevent this kind of development.193.	The Middle East continues to be a serious source of tension as a result of Israel's policies of annexation. The establishment of lasting peace in that region requires first of all the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the granting of the legitimate rights  of the Arab Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and the creation of its own State. A Middle East settlement must also ensure the right of all States in that area to independence and security. The path to the solution of this burning problem leads through the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the States directly concerned  and the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of its people.194.	Similarly  we unequivocally advocate a solution of the problem of Cyprus  which would strictly respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We support efforts to solve this problem in the hope that the United Nations and its Secretary-General will continue to play an important role in this respect.195.	We are following with close attention the situation in the Korean peninsula. We support the policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea designed to create conditions for the peaceful  democratic and independent reunification of Korea by means of the withdrawal of foreign troops.196.	We are in full solidarity with the people of Chile in their just struggle for the restoration of their fundamental civil rights and freedoms.197.	This general debate has shown that the most serious task facing our Organization is the safeguarding of the further development and consolidation of international detente in order to make it solid and irreversible and to spare mankind the impending threat of a thermonuclear cataclysm.198.	That is why Czechoslovakia warmly welcomed and whole-heartedly supported the proposal submitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Mr. A. A. Gromyko  to include in the agenda of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly as an important and urgent matter the item on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war It is our belief that all peace-loving States will whole-heartedly support the draft declaration on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and the draft resolution on prevention of the danger of nuclear war. Czechoslovakia will do everything in its power to bring about their adoption and implementation.199.	An important instrument for the systematic improvement of the general climate in the world could be an agreement on the non-use of force in international relations as proposed by the Soviet Union last year. In our view we should work intensively on that.200.	In the post-war period the Soviet Union and other socialist States have submitted more than 70 initiatives  from the proposal on general and complete disarmament to a number of proposals for partial disarmament measures. This in itself is proof that we regard the problem of disarmament and of the relaxation of military tension as being of paramount importance and as something that requires an immediate  positive solution.201.	This year those initiatives were supplemented by the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques  which was signed in May in Geneva. I should like to take this opportunity to emphasize once again the usefulness of the work done in Geneva by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament which prepared that Convention. Czechoslovakia  as a founding member of that body  which has been working for 15 years now  believes that its work is of long-term significance. An exceptionally important step towards peace and co-operation would be the general prohibition of the further-perfecting of nuclear weapons  including the so-called neutron bomb  the advantage of which is claimed to be that it does not destroy material objects but only human beings. How baldly ironical and cynical is the contradiction between the decision on the development of this bomb and the campaign launched at the same time for the so-called protection of human rights. We believe that the introduction of such appalling weapons must be stopped by the conclusion of an international agreement which would prohibit the development and manufacture of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. Every effort should therefore be exerted to bring about the implementation of the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union.202.	Of invaluable importance also would be the adoption of the proposal by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty addressed to all the signatories of the Helsinki Final Act to the effect that those States should conclude among themselves an agreement not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other.203.	Highly important  too  are the talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe  in which Czechoslovakia is a participant. Those talks can be successful only if the Western participants in the negotiations stop trying to gain one-sided advantages by infringing the interests of the socialist countries. If the Western side takes a realistic approach  the attainment of this goal is fully possible.204.	Speaking of disarmament  I have to say that the situation in the field of disarmament negotiations is far from satisfactory. It is therefore our duty to do everything possible to prepare properly for the special session of the- General Assembly which will deal with this situation in detail next year  and to make extensive use of the capacities of the Preparatory Committee set up for this purpose in which all regional groups should  however  be more fairly represented. The effectiveness of the special session in 1978 would be enhanced by the knowledge that it was to be followed by a World Conference on Disarmament  for which favourable conditions should be created with a view to obtaining the desired results.205.	Thanks to joint efforts by the socialist and developing countries  the first favourable results have been reached in the restructuring of international economic relations in accordance with current political realities. This has been done despite the attempts by imperialist States to maintain an economic system   bearing the imprint of colonialism  neo-colonialism and a recurrence of the cold war. It will  however  be necessary to exert considerable efforts to eliminate the discrepancy between the present character of international economic relations formed in the past and the timely demands now being presented by the majority of countries.206.	Czechoslovakia is waging a consistent struggle for the restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and equitable basis. We therefore support the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  and all the progressive provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Consistent implementation of the provisions of those documents in accordance with the generally recognized principles of relations among sovereign and equal partners will undoubtedly contribute to the elimination of the remnants of colonialism and neo-colonialism. The establishment of a new economic order would strengthen the economic and thereby also the political independence of young' developing countries.207.	Czechoslovakia is prepared to intensify even more the development of all forms of economic  scientific and technological co-operation with the developing countries  both at the bilateral level and through the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance. Although we bear no responsibility for the economic under-development of those countries  we shall continue to assist them in an effort to contribute to the solution of their burning economic and social problems.208.	Every year from this rostrum I have emphasized that we regard the United Nations as an important international forum. I am doing so today also  expressing our interest in this Organization's even more active contribution to the strengthening and deepening of the process of detente. In our view  the United Nations Charter is a document of universal validity. We are convinced that only its consistent implementation is a guarantee of future effective activities of the United Nations.209.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  a founder Member of the United Nations  through its purposeful  active and realistic contribution to its work  assists in the deepening of the process of detente and the expansion of constructive international co-operation.210.	We do so with the profound conviction that this policy  while expressing the genuinely humane essence of our socialist system  is in full accord with the vital interests of our people and of the peoples of the whole world. "
"34",1706,"CUB",32,1977,"﻿233.	 Mr. President  may I first express  you how joyfully the Government and people of Cuba welcome the entry of triumphant  united and socialist Viet Nam to the United Nations.234.	General Antonio Maceo  an illustrious Cuban patriot  who fell in battle fighting for the independence of our island  said that you do not beg for rights  you win them with the sword's edge. The right to become a Member of this Organization was won by the people of Viet Nam with the sword's edge  with a heroic struggle which inflicted a historic defeat on the imperialist armed forces which attempted to impose partition and neo-colonialism on the country.235.	The admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a great victory for its people  but it is also a victory for all progressive forces; a victory for the socialist community  which gave it its moral and material solidarity; for the movement of the non-aligned countries  which supported its struggle; for world public opinion  and even for public opinion in the United States  which opposed the fierce aggression unleashed by imperialism against Viet Nam. The admission of Viet Nam was also possible because of the conditions which these forces created in favour of peace and coexistence.236.	At this time it is important to recall that the United States is morally and legally committed to contribute to healing the wounds of the war which it started against Viet Nam. The General Assembly and other organs of the system must advocate and facilitate that contribution. Those who yesterday massively and indiscriminately bombed homes  hospitals  roads  railways  factories and temples  cannot today flee from the obligation to make a substantial contribution for reparation of the vast damages caused.237.	Together with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Republic of Djibouti joins our Organization. To their people and Government we extend our warmest congratulations.238.	Djibouti is the forty-ninth African State  and this fact bears witness to the relentless advance of the movement of national liberation  which in the last decade succeeded in destroying the old colonialist empires. The contribution which the new independent States have made to the United Nations cannot be overlooked. With the Organization's membership trebling it has really come close to the universality postulated by its constituent documents and its debates reflect the expression of the opinions and interests of the immense majority of the nations of the world.239.	Thus  in the decisions of the organs of the United Nations we find an echo of the victories of the socialist community  of the movements of national liberation and of the workers of the world in their struggle for peace and for the eradication of colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid and discrimination-that is to say  the elimination of imperialism.240.	An impregnable bastion of this cause is the homeland of Lenin  the Soviet Union  which  came into being during the glorious October Revolution and which  by defeating the Russian tsarist regime  liberating the people chained to its domination and creating the first proletarian State of the world  opened up a new era for mankind characterized by a general crisis for imperialism.241.	The people  the Communist Party and the Government of Cuba wish to pay a heartfelt tribute to the sixtieth anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution led by the Bolshevik Party  with the noble Vladimir Ilich Lenin at its head. We appreciate the enormous economic  scientific  cultural and all other successes of the Soviet people  which by building communism is able to enjoy  without exploiting any other people or robbing them of the products of their labour  constantly improving standards of living within a structure in which respect for human rights is guaranteed for every individual and for the nation as a whole.242.	We are equally pleased to note that the internationalist ideals of the October Revolution are obvious today  as they appear in the agreements and resolutions of the Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Fifth Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  in the tenacious defence of detente and peace  and in the historical peace decree signed by Lenin  ideals which  founded on the military power of the Soviet people and placed it at the service of its own defence and that of the sovereignty and independence of peoples  as well as at the service of that policy of peace  bind ever more tightly the aggressive hands of imperialism. This internationalism is also revealed in the firm and decided moral and material support which the Soviet Union has given and continues to give to national liberation movements resisting colonialism and apartheid  to the anti colonialist and anti-imperialist forces  and to any country invoking its just national interests in defence of its sovereignty and peaceful and independent development. This is proved by its assistance to Viet Nam  Cuba and Angola.243.	The fact that the thirty-second session of the General Assembly began with the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at a time close to the sixtieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution is an augury that its work will be fruitful and successful.244.	Our delegation joins in the general pleasure expressed at the election of Comrade Lazar Mojsov to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. It is particularly satisfying to greet in him the representative of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  with which we have many brotherly ties of friendship and co-operation. His election is  furthermore  a recognition of the efforts of the Government of Yugoslavia and President Tito  as they are in the -forefront among peoples struggling to build a new society  free from exploitation  and international relations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. His important contribution to the movement of non-aligned countries and the support given him by the members of that group will  together with his personal competence  contribute to his successful guidance of the work of this session of the Assembly.245.	Our delegation considers that a trend favourable to the cause of peace  independence and progress still predominates in international relations. In past years we witnessed the victories of the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos  Cambodia and Angola as well as the triumph of the national liberation movements in the former Portuguese colonies; today we see the growing isolation and universal rejection of apartheid and racism  and the trend towards the independence of Zimbabwe  Namibia and the liberation of the people of South Africa  a rejection which is strongly evident even in important sectors among the major capitalist Powers which are the allies and supporters of the Pretoria regime.246.	There is a growing trend towards peace and security  the strengthening and deepening of detente  a halt to the arms race  and the economic and social development of all peoples.247.	The Declarations of the last two Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries are a solid basis for co-ordinated action by this important group of countries in favour of the advance of the anti-imperialist and progressive positions. The community of interests among the socialist countries and the underdeveloped peoples has made it possible to put an end to the mechanical majority which in the past ruled the Organization  and to open up a period of important definitions and decisions which  inter alia  recognized the legitimacy of the struggle against colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid and resulted in documents such as that on the new international economic order and the Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States.248.	Imperialism  having suffered defeats at the hands of the liberation movements in Asia  Africa and Latin America  facing an indissoluble community of socialist countries in whose favour the correlation of international forces is moving step by step  and having failed to sustain its own economic development and to resolve inequalities and injustices in its own societies  suffered a grave political and moral crisis in its main institutions of power and is now going through a serious economic crisis.249.	This situation is compelling imperialism to seek to adjust its policy in order to survive the new facts of life  and to move back and attempt to find a new image for old claims.250.	The representatives of the major capitalist Powers are very free with expressions implying corrections of injustices and acts of aggression  and promising attention to the just claims of the developing world. We hope that these words will be translated into deeds  but we must not abandon the triumphs which we have obtained nor the positions which we have reached or reduce our vigilance.251.	It is not difficult to single out those who by old means and new are still determined to prevent the free expression of the will of peoples  to halt the progressive march of history  to repress and destroy revolutionary processes and the progressive Governments which  are moving ahead despite external political  military and economic harassment.252.	Those who uphold colonialism and neo-colonialism are organizing their dependent Governments most carefully so as to promote disunion  fratricidal wars and division among the non-aligned countries and among all progressive forces with a view to impeding the advance and consolidation of progressive tendencies.253.	There must be unity among all those who hope to consolidate peace and detente  attain the final elimination of colonialism and apartheid  advance general and complete disarmament and arrive at new just and equitable international economic relations. History both within and outside this forum proves that those who share these objectives are the socialist countries  the non-aligned countries and other countries guided by a desire for genuine international co-operation.254.	May I emphasize that we must be particularly alert to the tactic of the imperialists to promote and incite war so as to force a review of the frontiers left by the colonial era and the annexation of colonial territories under various guises.255.	Cuba maintains that such conflicts among the non- aligned and the under-developed countries in general must be resolved by negotiation without having recourse to the use of force  by seeking closer co-operation without territorial claims and  above all  without allowing any room for the divisive aims of imperialism. In this respect Cuba advocates a peaceful solution of the conflict between the brotherly peoples of Somalia and Ethiopia  within the context of their respective revolutionary frameworks.256.	The Ethiopian people have shaken off the secular yoke of feudal domination and have undertaken the revolutionary course of- giving the land to those who labour on it  carrying out urban reform  opening up education and culture to the vast masses and increasing attention to health  and this has inspired the support and solidarity of all peoples  and also the threats and aggressions of imperialist and reactionary forces.257.	If the revolutionary regime of Ethiopia were overthrown it would be impossible to arrive at any just solution of the claims now made by imperialism in order to pit the neighbours of Ethiopia against it.258.	Cuba considers that the process of revolutionary development which eliminates social  racial and national inequalities is the sole guarantee for the solving of the complex national and tribal problems which history has left behind in the countries of Africa and Asia.259.	Cuba supports the right of Ethiopia to defend itself from any external aggression.260.	The common heritage of colonialism for all peoples  but particularly for the Africans  was backwardness  poverty  illiteracy  and ill-health. After decades of colonial exploitation and administration  there emerged into independence peoples for whom no university had been built  for whom no doctor had been trained  for whom no schools  teachers  educational or health systems had been provided. The colonialist and neo-colonialist metropolitan Powers of those peoples contracted a tremendous debt which they must inevitably pay. We consider that the developed capitalist countries which benefited from colonial domination should  through adequate financing for development  compensate for the resources they obtained so as to begin to correct the ills left behind by centuries of pitiless exploitation.261.	It is our own efforts  of course  which are the basis of development; but it is necessary to have recourse to co-operation and collaboration among developing countries. Cuba has made an important but modest effort in this respect. Despite the economic blockade imposed on our country by the United States  and the restrictions caused by it  we have been sending doctors.  teachers  agricultural technicians and building brigades to other under-developed countries which requested them.262.	After the visit made by the Comrade President of the Council of Slate  Commander Fidel Castro  to eight African and Arab countries during the month of March last  these efforts have been intensified. The supreme leader of the Cuban revolution  following the most glorious inter  nationalist traditions of our people  has called upon the youth of the universities and the professionals of Cuba to provide their know-how to other lands  in the conviction that the deepest brotherhood unites all peoples of the world  and that we are obliged to share the still scarce resources we have with those who for so many years have been denied the recognition of their dignity and human rights.263.	Allow me to emphasize that Cuba considers that the task of doing away with the poverty left behind by colonialism is one of the most urgent tasks of this Organization and the entire international community.264.	The time that has elapsed since the last session has seen intense diplomatic activity by the representatives of the allies of Pretoria and Salisbury  who are making every effort to prevent the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa from being consolidated and strengthened  and from thus finally achieving the complete and real liquidation of the regime of exploitation they now suffer under.265.	Those who seek to present themselves as friends of Africa are the very ones who have facilitated  and still facilitate  for the apartheid regime the acquisition of every kind of armament  factories for manufacturing war material  and even technology and nuclear fuel which make it possible for the Pretoria authorities to possess nuclear weapons. Can anyone affirm that those who desire the freedom of the African peoples are those who arm the forces of South Africa and Rhodesia? Do they aspire to a just solution when  through the transnational corporations rid trade with South Africa  they benefit from the exploitation of the black people of that country?266.	In Africa a new situation has arisen because of the overthrow of Portuguese imperialism and the relentless advance of the national liberation movements. Those who supported Portuguese fascism until the end and who gave unstinting support to the racist regimes have been compelled to recognize in words that it is necessary to change the situation in southern Africa. Within this context the colonialists and the imperialists have been compelled to adjust their tactics and to promote manoeuvres intended to twist the course of the emancipation process and to preserve their interests. But peoples do not forget the lessons learned in the struggles for independence; and in particular they will never forget the lessons of the Congo and of the death of Patrice Lumumba. We must affirm that for any change in the region to be acceptable and to lead to a genuine solution  there must be a total eradication of apartheid and colonialist-racist exploitation  and the complete liberation of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa. As long as these objectives are not attained  peoples have an irrevocable right to continue the battle by the means that they deem appropriate; and the international community is duty-bound to give these national liberation movements all needed political  moral and material support to obtain a final victory.267.	While the African peoples face a crucial stage in their struggle  some pseudo-revolutionaries who have become outspoken allies of imperialism and racism  are tireless in their slander and intrigue  uselessly seeking to promote division in the revolutionary ranks  Bands fall and bands rise. But so far  regrettably  they persist in the same despicable course of treachery and felony. The band of yesterday has no scruples about arming the mercenaries who committed aggression against the people of Angola. Even today that band has not yet realized that the African peoples reject their scandalous collusion with the racists. That is why on Thursday last the General Assembly heard  a singular statement. After having detailed the harmful consequences of the action of defeated bandits  the representative of that Power used the same language which  during his transitory reign  made the spokesman of the band famous.268.	Cuba reiterates its support for the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa in their difficult  heroic but surely victorious struggle.269.	As has often been said  the phenomenon of colonialism is not limited exclusively to southern Africa nor even 10 Africa; and we cannot feel satisfied as long as a people remains that is denied the application of resolution 1514 (XV) and access to independence and self- determination.270.	Now that colonialism is reaching its final stage  we can observe that the manoeuvres of the colonial metropolitan Powers are proliferating and all kinds of formulas are being .drawn up to conceal relations of colonial dependency. It is therefore necessary to increase our solidarity and support for these peoples  and to prevent the expansionist attempts of the colonial metropolitan States  in the conviction that as long as a colonial territory persists there will be  besides a persisting injustice  a hotbed of potential conflict and a threat to international peace and security.271.	In this context we reiterate our support for the struggle of the peoples of Western Sahara and of EastTimor. We reaffirm our support for the people and Government of the Comoros and their just claim to the island of Mayotte and for the legitimate aspiration of the Argentine Republic to recover the Malvinas Islands. We reject the expansionist plans which the United States is hatching with regard to the island of Guam and the Micronesian territories.272.	In particular  we draw the attention of this Assembly to the threats to which the people of Belize are subjected. As is well known  their territory does not accede to independence because the reactionary dictatorship which oppresses Guatemala is prepared to annex it by force as soon as the Administering Authority withdraws.273.	It is fitting to recall that the present Government of Guatemala descends directly from the one imposed in 1954 by an act of aggression organized and financed by the Central Intelligence Agency  as is now publicly recognized.274.	In the last months  the diplomatic talks between the imperialists and the servants of the Guatemalan Government  and the bellicose declarations of the latter warrant our assumption that plans are being hatched against the people of Belize. Cuba renews its support for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize.275.	During the proceedings of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  at the end of August and the beginning of September there was a lengthy debate on the colonial situation of Puerto Rico.276.	A long list of petitioners of every political orientation amply demonstrated to the world three facts  namely  first  that there exists a situation of colonial domination in Puerto Rico; secondly  that the United Nations must take action to implement resolution 1514 (XV); and  thirdly  that all the petitioners were in favour of freedom for the political prisoners.277.	Those who attempted to compare the traditional support of for the people of Puerto Rico with a capricious or arbitrary attitude can find a denial—if that were needed-in the records of that Committee. Or; that occasion  Cuba reiterated its support for the independence and self-determination of the people of Puerto Rico; it supported the requests for the liberation of the Puerto Rican political prisoners  especially Lolita Lebron  Andres Figueroa  Irving Flores  Oscar Collazo and Rafael Cancel  who have languished for more than 20 years in United States gaols because they fought for the independence of their country.278.	Next year  the Special Committee will again consider the item  and it is obvious that it will be difficult to avoid the responsibility of adopting the resolutions that fit this case.279.	In the Middle East  the situation  far from improving  has deteriorated since the last session of the GeneralAssembly  tension has increased and the just peace that would lead to the resolution of all the factors of the crisis seems more remote than ever. The action of the Government of Israel in continuing to establish new Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and in extending Israeli legislation to the East Bank of the Jordan and the provocative declarations made with regard to the occupied territories by the Tel Aviv Prime Minister prove the real expansionist intentions of Israel. Furthermore  the intervention of Israeli military forces in southern Lebanon constitutes an aggression against that independent State and a new cause of disturbance. In the meantime  the allies of Tel Aviv and other reactionaries seek by their diplomatic and military manoeuvres to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people and to divide the Arab peoples. Cuba reiterates that the solution of the crisis can only lie in complete respect for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967. We deem it to be of the utmost urgency that the Peace Conference on the Middle East be convened -A Geneva with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned  including the PLO.276. Together with the other non-aligned countries  we support the declaration that was approved at the special meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the non-aligned movement held last 30 September I see A/32/255-S/12410/.211. When referring to the situation in Cyprus  we cannot fail to express the profound sorrow of our Government and people at  the death of Archbishop Makarios  an honest patriot and loyal representative of his people. His decease is now being used as an occasion for intensifying the division in the island. We demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and call for respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that non-aligned State.278.	Foreign troops are still present in South Korea  thus preventing the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea  by providing support to the brutal dictatorship of Park Chung Hee. We call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and all military equipment from Korea and the dissolution of the United Nations Command  and we renew our support of the just demands for the implementation of those objectives made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.279.	The Government of Cuba is making every effort to consolidate  extend and render irreversible the process of international detente. To contribute to this we have unequivocally supported the proposal of the Soviet Union regarding a treaty to prohibit the use of force in international relations. Likewise  we support the convening of a World Disarmament Conference and are working for it actively in the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament  to be held next year.280.	We are deeply disturbed at the rise in military expenditure by the United States Government and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and particularly at its decision to continue research into and manufacture of neutron bombs and the cruise missile  all of which are moves in the direction of the promotion of a new stage in the arms race and warrant our assumption that they are a dangerous threat to peace and security.281.	The decision to build a neutron bomb has aroused just and angry universal protest  because the nature of that bomb reveals the contempt of the Pentagon strategists for humanity. It is our hope that the General Assembly at this session will repudiate and condemn such decisions.282.	As a contribution to the disarmament process  Cuba has signed or has acceded to the following treaties: the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof; the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies; and the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.283.	A few months ago  in a dubious manoeuvre  the United States Government signed Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  thereby claiming to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards its neighbours to the south. For those intentions to gain credence  for us to be able to accept the peaceful nature of its will it would be enough if that Government  instead of limiting itself to signing documents subject to diverse interpretations  would take the practical action of removing its military bases from Puerto Rico  Panama and Cuba; if it would cease to claim to consider the Virgin Islands as part of its continental territory  thus removing it from the denuclearized zone  even though it is at the very heart of it; and if it would cease every act of aggression and hostility against all countries of the region.284.	During the past year  the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean have continued their historic struggle for the cause of their genuine independence and defence of their national sovereignty.285.	It is important to recall that that is one of the zones in the world where a great number of acts of aggression and intervention in the internal affairs of States were committed  where plans were hatched to assassinate Heads of Government and where territories were occupied in defiance of the will of the peoples by North American imperialism and its institutions and  in particular  by the CIA.286.	Within the context of this struggle  the people of Panama has just brought to a climax one of the phases that will lead to its recovery of full sovereignty over its national territory. The efforts made by the Government and people of Panama  headed in this decisive phase by General Torrijos  compelled the Government of the United States to recognize the right of Panama to total sovereignty over its lands and waters.287.	This lengthy  patient and valiant struggle of the people of Panama  as the Panamanian leaders themselves have said  has not ended. Or the one hand  major forces within the United States Senate are obstinately impeding the recognition of the legitimacy of Panamanian aspirations  thus holding up the ratification of the treaties that have been signed. Furthermore  there is the possibility that imperialist and reactionary aggressive forces will try to hamper the progressive exercise by Panama of the sovereign rights which the treaties restore to it over the course of time.288.	On the other hand  the United States Government has not renounced the right it accords itself of guaranteeing what it calls  the neutrality of the Canal . History has demonstrated that the only force which has prevented the Panama Canal from being neutral has been the United States itself.289.	The Cuban people under the leadership of the President of the Council of State  Comrade Fidel Castro  has been with Panama in its long struggle and we shall continue to be on its side. We cannot fail to rejoice in the victory that the recent signing of the treaties represents.290.	Another important fact has been the development of some of the institutions  such as the Latin American Economic System  which have emerged in the last year and which aim to defend the national interests of our peoples. Their viability and effectiveness have been demonstrated  although they are still in an initial stage.291.	In the southern part of the continent  the Fascist junta which has oppressed the people of Chile since 1973  has added to its long list of crimes  misdeeds and treachery against co-operation among Latin American countries. While international public opinion has compelled it to change the name of its institutions of repression and to launch a press campaign intended to create the impression that political prisoners have been released  in fact the repression and terror continue unabated  as determined by the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile  set up by the Commission on Human Rights to investigate the present situation in Chile. The Santiago authorities adopted the system of having those who were detained disappear without their families knowing what had become of them. Let us recall the desperate action of a group of those families when they occupied the offices of ECLA in Santiago  Chile  and demanded news of their fathers  sons and brothers who had disappeared. The junta has not yet complied with the commitments which it entered into at that time with the representatives of the United Nations.292.	The reactionary forces which  by means of Fascist terror try to maintain their oppressive rule over Chile  Uruguay  Paraguay and other countries and which have shamelessly joined forces with the Vorster apartheid regime  will one day be held to account by their peoples  whose determination to struggle they have not been able to overcome.293.	A debate is still going on regarding a critical situation which particularly affects the developing countries.294.	The gap between the developed and the developing countries has become wider because of the continued deterioration in the terms of trade and because of the growing effects of inflation and recession in the developed capitalist countries  together with their arbitrary international monetary system.295.	The world economy has been characterized by a rise in the foreign debt of the developing countries  which have no oil  by their growing balance-of-payments difficulties. These are compounded by a decrease in the purchasing power of their exports and by greater limitations on their access to the markets of the industrialized countries of the West that are rendered more severe by a renewed tendency towards protectionism on the part of those countries.296.	Despite repeated denunciations of the situation  the developed capitalist countries have not taken any action which would contribute to change this assessment.297.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation during its 18 months of work frustrated the expectations that many developing countries had of it. The inflexible positions of the developed capitalist countries participating in that Conference clearly demonstrated that they are not prepared to give up the benefits and the profits which they have for centuries enjoyed by exploiting the resources of the developing world.298.	The Group of 77  the Foreign Ministers of which met on 29 September last [see A/32/244!  arrived at the same conclusions.299.	Nevertheless  the developing countries have drawn valuable lessons from the lack of positive results of the Paris Conference. On the one hand  we learned the importance of maintaining unity and solidarity in the developing world as the only way effectively to meet the repeated attempts to divide us  and to act collectively for our common objectives. On the other hand  it enabled us to confirm the opinion that the only appropriate and representative organ for activities of this kind was the United Nations system. Further  we learned that it is essential that before negotiations of this kind are started  the objectives pursued must be clearly outlined and the results to be obtained must be defined in advance. In this respect  the General Assembly  as an organ for political decisions  must play an essential role. At the same time  the General Assembly must guarantee that fixed time-limits are agreed on for the pursuit and conclusion of negotiations.300.	My delegation is prepared to continue to play a constructive role during the debates of the thirty-second session  particularly with respect to agenda item 67. Yet  we strongly feel it is essential that the principles that should govern international economic relations based on justice and equity  on an absence of discrimination because of differences in economic and social systems  and on common interest and co-operation among States should remain in full force and should prevail in the debates which are to be held and in the conclusions which are to be reached.301.	We must not forget that in this context the negotiations to be carried out will not constitute an end in themselves  but a means to accelerate the real and effective establishment of the new international economic order.302.	To that end  we consider that the basis for our work is constituted by the Declaration and the Programme ofAction adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which contain the basic principles necessary for establishing new structures for international economic relations.303.	We  the developing countries  have an important role to play in bringing the new international economic order into being. On the one hand  we must persist in the efforts we have undertaken to develop economic and technical co-operation among ourselves. In this task the non-aligned movement has an important role to play. And we must encourage those developing countries which have considerable surplus finances to extend financial co-operation to those that have suffered appreciably from the effects of the crisis. That is a fundamental principle to be borne in mind in all areas of our co-operation.304.	On the other hand  we also have the task of making a decisive contribution so that the strategy for the third United Nations development decade can break free of the frustrating patterns which were characteristic of the first and second Decades and be realistically adjusted to the purposes and objectives of the new international economic order.305.	On 10 October next  109 years will have elapsed since the Cuban nation began its struggle for emancipation. The details of that long struggle have been recounted more than once and I shall therefore confine myself to saying that for 30 years the Mambi Army  which was the name of the army of our soldiers who fought for independence  confronted the powerful forces of the colonial mother country in an intermittent war which cost us almost half the population of the island of- Cuba. When the heroic struggle seemed to be on the brink of ending in victory for the Cubans  and when the colonial government confessed that it had not a cent more nor a soldier more to contribute to the war in Cuba  nascent North American imperialism intervened  and thus we were prevented from enjoying the fruits that were- ours by right  and Cuba became a neo-colonialist republic and remained so until 1959.306.	During all those years of pseudo-independence  the illustrious people of my country  honest patriots and militant revolutionaries  kept the flame lit on 10 October 1868 from being extinguished under neo-colonialist oppression.307.	The price paid as a result of foreign domination is high. Part of our territory  Guantanamo  was occupied by the United States  in perpetuity  under one of the treaties characteristic of the time; the economy of our island was totally distorted and it became a source of wealth for foreigners and of misery for Cubans.308.	On 1 January 1959 we achieved true independence and the exercise of sovereignty and we Cubans were able to conduct our foreign and domestic policy in accordance with our own interests  within the framework of respect for the rules of international law and peaceful coexistence.309.	It is not my intention here to give a long description of the economic  political and military aggression unleashed against the people of Cuba since it became master of its own destiny and acted accordingly. Suffice it to say that that aggression was initiated  as has been proved today by the investigations of the United States Senate itself  even before laws were enacted to restore to the Cuban nation its wealth  which remained in the hands of foreigners.310.	Since the first acts of hostility and aggression which we have suffered  the Government of Cuba has clearly expressed its desire to negotiate with regard to any differences which might exist with the Government of the United States and any claims  as long as the requirements of mutual respect and complete equality are observed. That desire has been the constant guide of my Government.311.	Already in 1960  when Commander Fidel Castro spoke here in this Assembly 2 4 he referred to that position of ours and quoted several notes addressed by the Government of Cuba to the Government of the United States which prove that point.312.	Yet it was not negotiations that followed but acts of aggression-the economic blockade of Cuba  the promotion of subversion  a campaign for Cuban citizens to leave their country and move to the United States  and the infiltration of paid CIA agents  the mercenary aggression of Playa Giron  and attempts at direct aggression during the so-called crisis of October 1962.313.	Nevertheless  Cuba unswervingly maintained its position. We continued to believe that the existing situation could be the subject of future negotiations to the benefit of both and to the advantage of international relations as a whole. However  the prerequisite of any negotiation is and will continue to be the cessation of all acts of hostility or aggression against Cuba and complete equality and mutual respect. That is why we cannot expect such negotiations to take effect as long as the blockade  a unilateral act taken by the Government of the United States  continues in force.314.	During the past months  the development of relations between the United States and Cuba has apparently taken a turn in the direction of respect for the rule of international law regarding peaceful coexistence. The Government of the United States has suspended the espionage flights which illegally violated our air space; North American citizens are once again allowed to visit Cuba and we have satisfactorily negotiated an agreement regulating the limits of the economic maritime zone of Cuba  and the exclusive fishing zone of the United States. These steps have created the necessary basis for proceeding  on the motion of the United States Government and with our agreement  to open a section on United States affairs in the Swiss Embassy at Havana and one on Cuban affairs in the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Washington.315.	We believe that both parties have made gestures and taken steps which are lessening the tension that has existed for many years in the Caribbean.316.	Nevertheless  despite everything that has passed  the blockade is still in effect and it is thus not possible to begin substantive negotiations on the claims and other matters pending between both parties.317.	Nor can we forget the continuance of the arbitrary occupation of a part of Cuban territory that cannot be separated from the rest and that we cannot renounce  that is  the so-called Guantanamo Naval Base. Nor can we forget that the blockade and the military aggression have inflicted grave losses of every kind on our people and have hampered our economic and social development. Such losses must be compensated for at the proper time.318.	The Government of Cuba considers that it has £n obligation to the international community to continue to demonstrate its willingness to resolve pending questions  when the requirements of mutual respect have been fulfilled. As has been stated since the beginning of the Revolution by its greatest leaders  it is not our intention to live in an atmosphere of permanent hostility with the United States. On the contrary  geographical and historical conditions exist which should be conducive to the existence of normal State relations between both countries.319.	However  above and. beyond such considerations there must be respect for the historic victories achieved by our nation  which took to the battlefield in 1868-victories that we shall not renounce at any price. Cuba will choose its friends  will assist those who ask for help  will develop its own institutions in accordance with its own economic and social system and will be ready to defend its country; it will not recognize capricious interpretations of the limits of its sovereignty  nor of its external or internal affairs.320.	Furthermore  the aim of isolating Cuba politically has resulted in the most ridiculous failure. Today our country maintains normal diplomatic relations with more than 100 States  and thousands of Cubans  at the request of friendly countries  contribute to their development.321.	Proof of this failure lies in the fact that we are now enthusiastically preparing to receive at Havana in 1979 the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  a movement of which Cuba was a founder member  together with 24 other countries  in 1961 and which today has more than 80 full-fledged members. The weight and influence of this movement in international relations in our time cannot be overlooked. Faithful to the principles of anti-colonialism and anti-neo-colonialism mentioned in our statements  and actively participating in the programme for economic co-operation  our people appreciates the high honour accorded it as host to the heads of State or Government of more than half the countries of the world.322.	In concluding  may I quote from a statement made by the President of the Council of State of Cuba  Commander Fidel Castro  on 28 September: We are a country that believes in the need for peace among all peoples in the world We are a country that believes in the need to avert a world war  which would be a holocaust of mankind. We believe in the need to prevent an arms race and a return to the cold war. We are a country prepared to live according to the norms of international law and to respect all other States as our State and our people are respected. "
"35",1752,"CYP",32,1977,"﻿ 1.	 Mr. President  it is with particular pleasure that I extend to you sincere congratulations upon your unanimous and well-deserved election to the high office of the presidency of this General Assembly session. Year election is a tribute paid to you personally for your outstanding qualities of statesmanship  experience and diplomatic skill and  at the same time  it is an added recognition of the leading role played in world affairs by your country. We  in Cyprus  have always attached great importance to the very close ties we have maintained with Yugoslavia  reinforced through many years by the friendship between our late President  Archbishop Makarios  and President Tito  two of the co-founders of the non-aligned movement  born at the historic Belgrade Conference at which I  too  had the privilege to participate. We have always felt that in Yugoslavia  as indeed in the non-aligned movement as a whole  Cyprus has a friend in its hour of need.2.	Likewise  I wish to pay a warm tribute to Ambassador Amerasinghe  the representative of Sri Lanka  another fellow non-aligned country  for the outstanding way in which he discharged the onerous responsibilities of the presidency of the General Assembly during its last session. We trust that  as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  he will continue to offer his effective leadership and unique experience towards the early and successful conclusion of this- very important undertaking of the international community.3.	I should also like to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his endeavours for the promotion of the objectives of the Organization generally and  more particularly  for his untiring efforts with regard to the solution of the Cyprus problem in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and its relevant resolutions.4.	I also wish to express gratification at yet another step towards the universality of this Organization through the admission to membership of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  and to welcome them in our midst. We are convinced that their presence will have a favourable impact upon international relations and will positively contribute towards peace  co-operation and mutual understanding.5.	As we embark upon this important session of the General Assembly  it is relevant to address ourselves to the fundamental questions which the Secretary-General raises in his report on the work of the Organization.""What...""  he asks  ""is the real position of the United Nations in the affairs of the world? Is it really a central element in the foreign policies of most Governments? Do its hard-fought resolutions  decisions and guidelines have a strong bearing on the conduct of nations? "" I cannot  of course  speak for others but in so far as my own country is concerned we have always held the firm conviction that to all these questions the answer should be a resounding ""Yes"".6.	The principles of the Charter have always been central to our foreign policy. We have supported positions consistent with such principles and have invariably maintained that the various international problems and issues considered by the United Nations should be solved through the implementation of its resolutions. Since its emergence to independence from colonial rule—and not only from the time we have been faced by a dire problem ourselves— Cyprus has been"" United Nations-minded  endeavouring by word and deed to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization and to promote the universal application of its principles and the full implementation of its resolutions.7.	In saying this  I do so not only in answer to the very pertinent questions posed by the Secretary-General but also because I strongly believe that this basic philosophy of making the United Nations and its principles and resolutions central to the foreign policies of Member States is-or ought to be-common to all Member States  and especially to those which emerged to independence from colonial rule and are politically non-aligned  economically developing and militarily weak. I believe that this philosophy should be shared by all  and indeed the Charter m legal terms is equally binding on all if the United Nations is to become truly effective and achieve its basic objectives for collective security and economic development.8.	In this respect  the convening of a special session of the General Assembly in 1978 on disarmament constitutes a major development.9.	The special session can prove a success if the opportunity is taken for a more thorough and enlightened examination of the problem of disarmament in its close relation to  and dependence on  international order and security through the United Nations  as provided in the Charter.10.	Progress on disarmament presupposes the cessation of the arms race  but nations cannot abandon their armaments in a vacuum. There must be an effective system of international security through the United Nations in accordance with the. Charter so that nations may feel safe in abandoning the course of armaments. In our technologically advanced world of close interdependence  the security of nations can no longer rest on the outdated concept of the balance of power  which is tantamount to a balance of weapons  since that inevitably implies an ever-escalating arms race in the effort to retain the balance. In consequence  this race has resulted in astronomical figures of wasted resources in preparation for a war which  if it should occur  would mean total catastrophe for mankind.11.	The pattern of world order provided for in the Charter depends on the effective functioning of the Security Council. According to the Charter  the Security Council shall not only ""determine the existence of any . .. breach of the peace  or act of aggression"" but also decide what effective measures shall be taken to restore peace and security. Those provisions of the Charter are mandatory  and rightly so  since the availability of enforcement action for Security Council decisions is the corner-stone of international security and legal order through the United Nations.12.	Therefore  no realistic prospect of disarmament can exist until the international community  recognizing the imperative need to comply with the Charter for international security through the United Nations  finds a new approach more adapted to the urgent requirements of our times.13.	The enormous waste of resources resulting from the absence of an agreement on disarmament brings into focus the widening gap between the rich and the poor  which is one of the main sources of tensions and conflicts in the world today. The developing countries have become more and more dependent on unpredictable and exogenous factors and  consequently  their sustained development is becoming increasingly more difficult.14.	Our position is that the international community must take a global view of development. Just as in any particular country richer regions help and contribute to the development of the poorer regions  in the world community of multilateral organizations richer countries and countries endowed by nature with ample resources have a corresponding duty to help poorer countries. It is only thus that progress can be achieved towards the establishment of a new and fairer international economic order  which in the long term would also be in the interest of the developed countries.15.	It has been rightly observed that  perhaps more than in any other field of international activity  in the field of human rights we face the wide gap between idealistic declarations and hard realities. This is no doubt due to the failure to translate declarations into actions  in spite of the fact .that respect of individual dignity and fundamental freedoms is a solemn undertaking expressly contained in the Charter as well as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.16.	It is a source of satisfaction that the International Covenants on Human Rights entered into force in 1976 and  therefore  the review mechanism provided by them has already been established  thus offering additional guarantees for the protection of human rights by the States legally bound by the Covenants. We would therefore express the hope that the countries which have not as yet ratified the two Covenants will soon do so.17.	The effort to ensure universal respect for human rights and the struggle for the elimination of racial discrimination in general and of apartheid in particular have been given a new impetus following the signing on 1 August 1975 in Helsinki of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the adoption of the Lagos Declaration for Action against Apartheid.18.	Turning to a more specific issue  we welcome the recent signature of the Panama Canal treaties. They represent  we think  a fair and reasonable agreement arrived at through negotiations in accordance with the principle of  the peaceful settlement of international disputes on an issue involving fundamental points of principle. This is an event of historic significance and furnishes an excellent example of how long-standing  thorny and potentially explosive international problems can be solved if approached by those concerned with goodwill  a spirit of compromise and genuine respect of each other's position and legitimate interests.19.	As very aptly stated by the Secretary-General in his report ""The situations in southern Africa  the Middle East andCyprus are serious in themselves and also have veryspecial implications for international peace and security.""Indeed  in all three situations fundamental issues of principle are involved and striking similarities exist.20.	In South Africa the situation has deteriorated because of the intensification of the abhorrent policy of apartheid and has resulted in massacres of the African population in Soweto and elsewhere. My country has always by word and deed demonstrated its solidarity with the African people. We unreservedly condemn the policy of apartheid. We have fully complied with the United Nations resolutions with regard to the South African regime  and we are resolutely opposed to the creation of artificial  bogus States-in itself an invidious form of partition—in a calculated effort by the racist regime to perpetuate its oppressive rule and to rob the African population of its birth right. In Namibia the illegal occupation by the Pretoria regime must be terminated  and its people must exercise the right to self- determination as prescribed in the relevant United Nations resolutions. In Zimbabwe there should be no independence before majority rule  and we welcome the efforts currently under way to achieve a negotiated solution  which should conform with the fundamental positions of principle contained in United Nations resolutions.21.	In our neighbouring region of the Middle East the systematic defiance of the decisions of the United Nations and the illegal occupation of Arab territories continues and is in fact being consolidated through systematic efforts to change the demographic composition of these territories and through illegal settlements. We firmly support a just and lasting solution based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as defined in those resolutions. We also favour the early reconvening of the Geneva Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned  including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In this respect we welcome as a step in the right direction the recent joint statement of 1 October 1977 by the Secretary of State of the United States and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union.22.	For the fourth consecutive year the question of Cyprus is included in the agenda of the General Assembly as a major international problem.23.	The membership of the United Nations is therefore not unaware of the series of devastating calamities brought upon the people of Cyprus  Greek and Turkish alike  through the double aggression and invasion by Turkey in July and August 1974. The membership is also fully aware that the Cyprus problem in its essence is one of aggression by Turkey  a large and militarily powerful State  against the Republic of Cyprus  a small and virtually defenceless non-aligned State. It is indeed because the problem of Cyprus involves the violation of the peremptory principles of the Charter regarding interstate relations that the United Nations is concerned with it.24.	At its twenty-ninth session in 1974  the year of the invasion of Cyprus by the Turkish armed forces  the General Assembly  voicing the grave concern of the international community over the Turkish aggression and the serious situation created thereby  unanimously adopted the landmark resolution 3212 (XXIX). In its primary and key provisions this resolution calls for respect of the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  for the speedy withdrawal from its territory o~ all foreign armed forces  for the cessation of foreign interference in its affairs  andfor the urgent return of the refugees to their homes in safety.25.	This resolution was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly  with Turkey also casting its assenting vote. And it should be noted that it stands endorsed by resolution 365 (1974) of the Security Council  and is thereby rendered mandatory. Regrettably  the attitude of Turkey towards these resolutions has been one of contemptuous disregard.26.	The aggression against Cyprus and the systematic violation of the fundamental human rights of its people proceeded to increase before the eyes of the international community without any effective action being taken by the United Nations for the implementation of its resolutions on a matter involving the basic principles of the Charter. And therein lays not only the tragedy of Cyprus  but more widely the unfolding tragedy of an ineffective United Nations.27.	Thus  Turkey  unrestrained by any effective measures  found it possible to pursue a policy of faits accomplis  and  using the Turkish Cypriot leadership as an instrument  proceeded to the purported setting up of a so-called Federated Turkish State of Cyprus.28.	The Security Council  in its resolution 367(1975)  rejected this unilateral action  reaffirmed its earlier resolution  and expressed its concern over all unilateral actions compromising the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The Security Council further called on the parties concerned to refrain from any action which might prejudice the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus as well as from any attempt at partition of the island or its unification with any other country. However  Ankara's policy of sowing intercommunal discord and divisiveness and promoting  through the oppressive presence of its army of occupation  its partitionist designs against Cyprus continued unabated  thus necessitating the adoption of new resolutions by the General Assembly and the Security Council.29.	Turkey  in violation of international law  and of its commitments under the Geneva Conventions of 1949  proceeded further to trample underfoot the United Nations resolutions by further expulsions of indigenous Greek Cypriots from the occupied area  thus raising the number of the refugees to 200 000  namely  one third of the total population of Cyprus. Worse still  in their usurped homes and properties it settled colonizing populations massively imported from Turkey. The General Assembly  recognizing the grave threat against the demographic character of Cyprus resulting from the expulsions and the colonization called  by its resolution 3395 (XXX)  for the cessation of any action aimed at changing the demographic structure of Cyprus.30.	Last year  as a result of the continuing refusal of Turkey to comply with the aforementioned United Nations resolutions on Cyprus  the General Assembly  considering thus that the Cyprus crisis constitutes a threat to international peace and security  adopted resolution 31/12  by which it expressed the hope that the Security Council would consider appropriate steps for the implementation of its unanimous resolution 365 (1974).31.	Recent developments regarding the attempts at colonization even of the new Famagusta area  which since 1974 had been sealed off pending arrangements for the return of its legitimate inhabitants to their homes and properties  further aggravated the already serious situation in the island. The Security Council  as recently as last month  by its resolution 414 (1977)  disapproved of this action and expressed concern at the situation thereby created in the new Famagusta area. It further called once again for the urgent implementation of its resolution 365 (1974)  endorsing General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX).32.	I now turn to the intercommunal talks which  as provided in the resolutions  have as their subject-matter the internal aspect of the problem. All rounds of talks  despite the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General  have  two and a half years after their commencement  failed to produce any positive results due to the attitude of Turkey  which  by dictating the Turkish Cypriot position in the negotiations  has never allowed a constructive and meaningful dialogue to develop. And  in consequence  the negotiations were not freely conducted  as provided for in the relevant United Nations resolutions. Thus  the only purpose the talks have so far served has been to enable Turkey to cover up its faits accomplis by a pretence of negotiation to consolidate its military stranglehold over the occupied area.33.	We have all along held the view that the process of the intercommunal talks is the best available means for the settlement of the internal aspect of the Cyprus problem. We have accordingly been supporting the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  to secure meaningful and substantive negotiations. These efforts  however  have so far produced no results because of the negative attitude of the Turkish side  which has been persistently refusing to submit concrete and comprehensive proposals to the subjects under negotiation  unlike the Greek Cypriot side.34.	No problem is impossible to solve if substantive talks are conducted with goodwill and a common objective. This has been and continues to be our view. It is in this spirit that we welcome any initiative from any country which aims at assisting the Secretary-General in his difficult task  as long as such initiatives are kept within the framework of the United Nations.35.	Similarly  we welcome any initiative aiming at the implementation of those provisions of the United Nations resolutions which refer to die external and international aspects of the Cyprus problem. With this in view we have consistently been supporting the proposal for the convening of a wide international conference on Cyprus  which we believe could make a positive contribution to the solution of the Cyprus problem.36.	The present situation in Cyprus is fraught with grave danger and  if allowed to continue unchecked  could have very serious implications for peace and security in the sensitive region of the eastern Mediterranean.37.	The solution of the problem of Cyprus revolves around the effective implementation of the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. I believe that the time has come for the General Assembly to impress upon the Security Council the necessity of taking as a matter of urgency all measures warranted by the situation in order to bring about the long overdue implementation of the Council's resolutions on Cyprus and thereby put an end to the long suffering of the people of Cyprus  Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike.38.	Failure of the United Nations expeditiously to promote the implementation of its * resolutions might be interpreted as tolerance or passive acceptance of Turkey's aggression and continuing military occupation of territory of the Republic of Cyprus and would run counter to the basic tenets of the Organization.39.	I have come to this Assembly to seek justice for Cyprus and its people  on the respect for the principles of the Charter  of international law and of the human rights of all Cypriots. I have come here to seek justice for the 200 000 refugees who  for more than three years  are forcibly being kept away from their ancestral homes and lands  for all those who are being deprived of their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms  for the families of the over 2 000 missing persons whose fate is unknown. For these persons and on behalf of their families who live in the agony of uncertainty  I make a special plea that every possible effort be made to ascertain the fate of these missing persons.40.	In our interdependent world  it is in the common interest of all Member States  large and small  to strengthen the efficacy and the role of the United Nations as an instrument-the only universal instrument we have-for the achievement of peace  co-operation and progress in the world. The United Nations has ushered in a new era in international affairs by providing objective standards of behaviour based on principles and by democratizing international relations. Its failures are primarily those of its Members and not of the Organization itself. It is up to the Member States to do what they can in order to strengthen the United Nations and render it the dynamic instrument for peace and progress that it ought to be and can be. "
"36",1820,"DDR",32,1977,"﻿44.	Permit me to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to your high office. To do so gives me particular pleasure since you are from a country with which the German Democratic Republic has close and friendly ties. Your election reflects the significant role played by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the struggle for peace  security and equitable co-operation among States and peoples.44. To the Secretary-General of this Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  we wish to express anew our appreciation of his constant endeavours to achieve the aims of the United Nations and to assure him of our co-operation.45. The German Democratic Republic expects this thirty second session of the General Assembly to yield results that will strengthen world peace and promote fruitful co-operation among States. Favourable conditions for that have been created. Political detente remains the prevailing tendency in international relations; it coincides with the vital interests of all peoples and is supported by their effort. There is no other way to make peace enduring and guarantee international security.46. Practical experience in the last few years has confirmed that the improvement of the international situation is of benefit to all. It is something new and significant in this century that the peoples can live in greater tranquillity  that confrontation is being reduced and that a substantive political dialogue becomes possible between States having different social systems. Surely it is useful to all sides when a closer network of equitable international agreements can be established and confidence thus strengthened. Is it not in the interest of all mankind when conditions for far-reaching measures of arms limitation and disarmament are emerging and the risk of a world war is prevented? Do not all the parties profit from the improvement in political relations if this is conducive to intense economic exchanges and facilitates communication? And do not all the peoples and States stand to gain when vital questions like environmental protection   transport and energy can now be attacked jointly?47. Everywhere in the world detente militates against the forces of aggression and war and encourages the peoples struggling for national and social liberation. Not accidentally but precisely under these conditions it was possible to adopt the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to start eliminating the imperialist and neo-colonialist division of labour.48. To secure and expand these accomplishments is the common purpose of the socialist countries and consequently of the German Democratic Republic  too. 49. By contrast  what can the opponents of détente offer? Overtly or covertly they are working for a return to the cold war. The most extreme ones  in the interest of profit  even calculate the risk of an atomic war. If they had their way there would be no end to the arms race  interference in the internal affairs of other States would continue  international relations would be ruled by an atmosphere of distrust and enmity  and constructive international co-operation would be obstructed or even prevented. Their designs also are directed towards preserving the last few strongholds of colonialism and racism as well as neo-colonialist exploitation. 50 Hence there is reason enough to be vigilant and to redouble all efforts so that political detente will be reinforced and extended further. In this effort the socialist States feel united with the movement of non-aligned countries  which is playing an important role in the struggle for the vital interests of the peoples  and indeed with all social forces committing themselves to peace regardless of differences in world outlook. How powerful their ranks are is evident in the swelling protest against plans to develop and produce new weapons of mass destruction such as the neutron bomb and the cruise missile. The movement for peace  disarmament and social progress is going from strength to strength. The United Nations can and should rely on that. It ought to assist resolutely in translating initiatives and present proposals for the strengthening of international security and for disarmament into practical moves.51. Deepening and consolidating the relaxation of international tensions and preventing the risk of nuclear war is as important as it is urgent. The proposal made here by the Soviet Union and the relevant documents submitted /see A/32/242]  when adopted  are such as to strengthen international security and save humanity from a nuclear holocaust. Moreover  they are calculated to promote the work of the United Nations in fulfilling the very task assigned to it. For this reason we plead fervently and insistently in their favour.52	There is no doubt that we live in an epoch of profound revolutionary change. By their sacrifice in their struggle for peace and self-determination the peoples are gaining more and more successes. What better proof of that is there than the victory of the heroic peoples of Viet Nam and Laos  which is indeed of historic importance?53	The admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations has come as a tribute visible to all the world paid to a struggle waged over decades against imperialist aggression and oppression and for national and social liberation. It is fully in accordance with the wishes and demands of all peace-loving peoples and States. Together with its socialist sister countries  the German Democratic Republic has always espoused the cause of Viet Nam.. We congratulate the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on its membership in the world Organization  as we are firmly convinced that it will make an important contribution to the fulfilment of the tasks of the United Nations.54.	On the African continent  the people of Djibouti acceded to independence this year. We greet the Republic of Djibouti as a new Member of the United Nations and whole-heartedly wish it success.55.	The admission of those two States to the world Organization provides further evidence of the tremendous changes that mould the features of our globe. The starting point was the Great October Socialist Revolution the sixtieth anniversary of which coincides with our current session. The ideas and aims the Revolution proclaimed have become material force.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics s the living example of the consistent realizationof national and social self-determination  which are prerequisites for fundamental human rights. Time and again the Soviet Union has proven to be a dependable ally for the peoples in the struggle against imperialist aggression and oppression. We shall never forget its decisive role in the victory over fascism. The German Democratic Republic is closely linked with the country of Lenin  and on the occasion of their great anniversary we wish the Soviet people further successes in the construction of communism.56.	The principles of peaceful coexistence  conceived by Lenin  are today becoming generally recognized norms of international law. This is also evident in endeavours to strengthen security in Europe as demonstrated by the set of European treaties and in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a long-term programme for European security and co-operation the Final Act provides a fresh impetus to detente. To turn it to account without restriction and to the benefit of all peoples  all parties should be willing to implement the document as a whole. Attempts to be selective and to ignore its basic principles are inconsistent with its binding aims. We repeat here what the German Democratic Republic emphasized at Helsinki  namely that security is and remains a prerequisite to co-operation. The German Democratic Republic considers that the main purpose of the forthcoming Belgrade meeting of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is to promote the implementation of the Helsinki accords.57.	To breathe life into the Final Act requires further bilateral and regional agreements. But equally important is the strict observance of the international treaties already concluded. Never before has the principle of pacta sunt servanda been so firmly established in international realities and been of so great practical importance for the maintenance of peace.58.	Regrettably  increasing attempts are being made to disregard obligations entered into  but treaties have to be honoured. This applies to the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as well as to the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin. Contrary to the clearly formulated provisions of those treaties  inappropriate attempts have been made time and again  and in this forum too  to construe unrealistic concepts that are detrimental to peace. Therefore  it appears necessary to repeat the following.59.	One of the irrefutable realities in Europe for three decades now has been the existence of two sovereign German States which are independent of each other-the socialist German Democratic Republic and the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany. One of the realities confirmed by a treaty is that West Berlin is not a constituent part of the Federal Republic of Germany and must not be governed by it. Pursuant to the set of European treaties and to the Final Act of Helsinki  international legal and political consequences will have to be drawn everywhere.60.	Freely exercising their right to self-determination  the people of the German Democratic Republic have irrevocably opted for socialism. Our State is a firm constituent part of the socialist community. Attempts to disregard this fact endanger peace and security in Europe. The peoples will not tolerate that. The relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can serve—indeed must serve—the peace and security of the peoples. For this reason  they are only feasible on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. As everybody will be aware  this requires  in particular  strict respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as non-interference in internal affairs. The broadening of the relations therefore requires implementation of the existing international treaties in letter and in spirit.61.	The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its view that  for detente to become lasting and stable  it must be extended to all regions of the world. We feel that this basic purpose is served  above all  by the initiative the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics took at the thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly for the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.1062.	It is noteworthy that this project covers two fundamental requirements of political detente in their interrelationship. It links non-use of force with a general prohibition of the use of all types of weapons  and it obligates all States to bring about disarmament. That would add substance to the principle of non-use of force as laid down earlier in the Charter of the United Nations. The argument that such a treaty would hollow out or question this principle turns things upside down. The continuing affirmative response to that proposal reinforces our view that the text of the treaty should now be negotiated.63.	The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty reaffirmed in their Declaration of 26 November 1976  that the most important and pressing task of our time is to stop the arms race and carry out disarmament  first and foremost in the nuclear Held  and to eliminate the danger of a world war. Political reason and legal commitments as well as humanity call for vigorous action to check the accumulation of means designed to destroy man.64.	How justified these demands are is borne out by alarming news on the gathering momentum in the development and production of new weapons of mass destruction. The socialist States are striving unswervingly for general and complete disarmament. They have presented a comprehensive programme outlining realistic steps to that end. Of course other constructive proposals will also be examined. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  stated the following when he signed the new Stockholm Peace Appeal: We stand for effective measures which bring about arms limitation and disarmament based on the principle of undiminished security. We strongly advocate that political detente be complemented with military detente.Many of the problems facing mankind today and tomorrow could be solved more easily and quickly if the gigantic resources which are today invested in armaments were used for peaceful purposes. 65.	The year 1979 has been declared the International Year of the Child  and the following comparison suggests itself. Every two minutes almost $1.4 million is being spent in today's world on military purposes. That sum  WHO has calculated  would suffice to immunize about 700 000 children against various infectious diseases; and that would be instrumental in reducing the alarming level of infant mortality in many parts of the globe. But the arms race continues to absorb immense material and intellectual resources which are needed to solve that and other social and economic problems. The development and stockpiling of means of warfare by far outrun the talks on their restriction and prohibition. A quicker pace in those negotiations is therefore imperative.66.	The special session on disarmament  to be held by the General Assembly in a few months' time  ought to lead to agreement on a joint disarmament programme. That would be an encouraging contribution for all with regard to preparations for the World Disarmament Conference.67.	Of paramount importance for nuclear disarmament are the Soviet-United States negotiations on the limitation of strategic armaments. The German Democratic Republic commends the persistent efforts made by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to reach agreement to that effect.68.	The destruction of nuclear weapons is a difficult but nevertheless urgent task. It would become even more complicated if the number of nuclear-weapon States were to increase. Therefore  it is absolutely necessary to strengthen the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.69.	The German Democratic Republic feels that preventive steps against the development and manufacture of new kinds and systems of weapons of mass destruction are urgent and pressing. Likewise  greater efforts are necessary to attain at long last a complete ban on nuclear-weapon tests and on chemical weapons.70.	We welcome and appreciate the endeavours of the Soviet . Union  the United States of America and the United Kingdom to suspend underground nuclear weapon tests for a certain period of time. It is highly significant that the Soviet Union  together with the partners mentioned  is willing to do so-even before the other nuclear Powers accede to the future treaty.71.	We also expect progress in the Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. The socialist States submitted realizable proposals right at the beginning. There can be no doubt that the proposal that the Warsaw Treaty States addressed to the other States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to conclude a treaty prohibiting the first use of nuclear weapons against each other merits maximum attention. The acceptance of this proposal would strengthen confidence among the States.72.	The situation in the Middle East is as explosive as ever  yet Security Council resolutions on the matter are disregarded. The implementation of these resolutions is  however  a prerequisite for a comprehensive political settlement of the problems of that region. We hold that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East is the competent body for that purpose. Participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on an equal footing is  indeed  a matter of course. The rights of the Arab peoples must not be disregarded. To put it frankly: a settlement of the Middle East conflict requires Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967. The inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including their right to self-determination and to establish a State of their own  must be guaranteed. And  finally  the rights of all States of the region to an independent existence  security and development must be recognized.73.	Efforts to settle the Cyprus conflict on the basis of sovereignty  independence  non-alignment and territorial integrity should be stepped up. The convening of a conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations is more topical than ever.74.	The German Democratic Republic expresses its solidarity with the just demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful solution of the Korean question  for which the resolution adopted at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly provides the basis. All foreign troops  along with their arms  must be withdrawn from South Korea.75.	The United Nations Charter expresses the aspiration of the peoples for peace  security and independence. That instrument has proved its worth  and every day it is proving its viability anew. It must not be questioned. The effectiveness of the world Organization can be heightened only if all States comply with their obligations under the United Nations Charter.76.	We are worried about the situation in southern Africa. The racists are resorting to ever more brutal methods to break the will of the oppressed peoples to win their freedom. With external assistance they are increasing their arms drive  and they even threaten to produce atomic bombs. They hire mercenaries and attack free African States. That is extremely dangerous and provocative.77.	The apartheid regime in South Africa persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia and is conspiring with Southern Rhodesia. There are some who want to save that regime in order to maintain their influence there. By calling for a peaceful solution they try to delude the peoples. But is it possible to come to a peaceful solution when the racists are being supplied with weapons that enable them to carry on terrorism and aggression? And what should one think of those who enable them to get armed with nuclear weapons  while they dispute the right of the national liberation movements to defend the interests of their peoples?78.	The peoples in southern Africa  just like others  have a right to take their destiny into their own hands and freely to choose their social system. Any peaceful solution can only begin by forcing the aggressors and terrorists to lay down arms and by isolating the racists.79.	Effective steps by the United Nations for a mandatory arms embargo and for halting all co-operation with South Africa and for an expansion of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia are therefore necessary.80.	The upsurge of the national liberation struggle  assisted by the strength of steadily mounting international solidarity  makes us confident that the cause of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa will be victorious. The German Democratic Republic pledges to continue to support that struggle to the best of its ability.81.	The German Democratic Republic advocates international economic relations based on equal rights and mutual benefit. For this reason we wish again to call attention to the programme the socialist States presented at the fourth session of UNCTAD.82.	By government agreements and by commercial  scientific and technological relations with developing countries and other measures which it scrupulously implements in letter and spirit  the German Democratic Republic supports the economic and social progress of these States. Strains on the world economy in the wake of the capitalist crisis could not affect these relations. Thus  the new type of cooperation between States has proved its viability. It is free from neo-colonialist exploitation and discrimination. Those who used to squeeze immense profits out of the colonially subjugated countries and are today shifting the burden of their crisis onto the nationally liberated States are alone responsible for the difficult economic situation of many of the developing countries. No honest person can countenance attempts to undermine the decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.83.	The German Democratic Republic sides with the developing countries and is against any kind of neo- colonialist exploitation.84.	The outcome of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation demonstrates that international economic problems involving the interests of all peoples should be negotiated in the United Nations. The cooperation of all States in the democratic restructuring of economic relations is a requirement which is in conformity with the Charter of the world Organization. The same applies to technological co-operation.85.	The striving of peoples for peace  security and liberation from all kinds of oppression means struggle for the exercise of human rights. These rights are severely and brutally violated by wars of aggression and by Fascist  racist and colonialist terrorism.86.	The United Nations has addressed itself to eliminating flagrant and massive violations of human rights. That is consistent both with its main task and its competence. Accordingly  this session of the General Assembly must not allow a mantle of silence to be spread over Fascist terrorismin Chile. It should rather assist in halting those practices in that country. With the same determination we speak out against the violation of human rights in southern Africa and in the territories occupied by Israel.87.	The two International Covenants on Human Rights which became effective last year provide an important foundation for co-operation by States on what are called individual human rights. In this context it may well be noted that all attempts to misuse this question in order to interfere in the internal affairs of States are not only contradictory to the Charter of the United Nations but also place a strain on relations between States. Those who are engaging in a campaign of slander against other States under the flag of human rights would be well advised to concern themselves with the realization of human rights in their own countries.88.	A few days ago Erich Honecker  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and the Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  said: If in today's world a political force is entitled to speak out on human rights  then it is first and foremost the revolutionary working-class movement. And if in today's world a political system can claim to have given effect to human rights  then it is the world socialist system. 89.	Socialism  having abolished the exploitation of man by man  assures the right to live in human dignity; it ensures the exercise of the right to work  and hence to education and recreation  as well as to most generous medical services and care for the aged; it enables women to enjoy equal rights with men and treats all human beings alike  irrespective of race or colour. It is the system which assures a future in peace and social security  where everybody can develop his abilities for the benefit of society and contribute on an equal footing to his community's international affairs. This is highly evident in everyday life.90.	The socialist States grant their citizens all rights and opportunities for individual development which  for instance  for millions of unemployed  women without equal rights or youths without training in countries that like to pose as models  can only remain a dream.91.	Statistics provide ample information as to exactly where millions of people are being deprived of such fundamental rights.92.	This General Assembly is faced with great tasks indeed. It can only cope with them if co-operation and understanding prevail. The German Democratic Republic will contribute its efforts to ensure that the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will chart a successful course in the interests of strengthening world peace and mutually beneficial co-operation among the peoples.

"37",1838,"DEU",32,1977,"﻿91.	 Mr. President  I should like first on behalf of the Federal Government to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and at the same time I should like to express our pleasure that you  an outstanding political personality and diplomat  representing one of the leading countries of the non-aligned movement  are presiding over this Assembly.92.	On behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany I welcome in our midst the two new Members  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. This is an important step towards bringing our Organization nearer to the goal of universality.93.	We have assembled here to try and bring the world-a world divided by conflicting ideologies  separated by a gulf between poor  and rich nations  torn by various conflicts- further along the long road to our objective: a world of peace  of economic and social progress  a world in which the dignity of man is respected. In fulfilling this task  central importance attaches to the United Nations  the only universal organization.94.	Our age is one of far-reaching change. New thinking and new action are required. Only a generation ago the course of the world was determined by a few big Powers. Since then a hundred new States have emerged and have entered world politics with their own ideas and their own claims. For the first time in history the nations of the world are aware of their dependence on one another worldwide.95.	There is a growing recognition of the fact that through co-operation we must transform our period of transition into an era of joint progress  in order to prevent it from becoming  through confrontation; an era of joint decline The world is looking for a just order of co-operation. In the past the system between States was often understood as a relationship of supremacy and subordination  politically  militarily and economically. This policy of supremacy no longer has a future. True  the idea of safeguarding one's own interests through power politics is by no means extinct. But it is confronted by the strongest force of this era: the will of nations for self-determination and independence.96.	That will is strong particularly in the nations of Africa  Asia and Latin America. It has led to the dissolution of the huge colonial empires  and it will doom to failure any endeavour to establish new dependencies. This also applies to any attempt to establish supremacy by ideological means through ideological colonialism.97.	Under the conditions prevailing in today's world  a country's interests can be safeguarded on a durable basis only through a policy of co-operation and fair reconciliation of interests. The world order of the future can only be an order based on equality.98.	The Federal Republic of Germany has from the very outset built its foreign policy on respect for the self-determination and equal rights of all nations. We want self- determination for the indivisible German nation. We are helping to build the European Community  a Community in which all members have equal status and equal rights.99.	We are also helping to shape the North Atlantic Alliance  an alliance which is a union of equal member States.100.	With our policy of detente we are seeking co-operation with our Eastern neighbours on the basis of equal rights and mutual benefit.101.	We seek equal and balanced partnership with the nations of Africa  Asia and Latin America  and we fully support them in their claim to independence and the right to develop as they see fit.102.	In a nutshell  we want a world devoid of supremacy. We do not want to establish spheres of influence; we do not want to export ideologies. Rather we want a world in which all nations will determine their own way of life politically  economically and culturally and in which they will cooperate as partners  as equals.103.	The movement of the non-aligned has become a major force in the quest for such a world of independence and equality of nations. Regional groupings as well  based on equality  can also make an essential contribution in Asia  in Africa and in Latin America.104.	Our aim is a world of partnership. This means we must achieve the following goals. First  in order to safeguard peace  we must bring about constructive co-operation between Western and Eastern industrialized countries  beyond all ideological differences. Secondly  we must stop the arms race  which threatens peace and wastes resources. Thirdly  we must settle the smouldering conflicts in many regions of the world by peaceful means. Fourthly  we must constantly reduce the gap between rich and poor nations. We must overcome hunger and need and misery everywhere in the world. Fifthly  we must make respect for the rights and the dignity of man the foundation of justice and stability in the world.105.	In a world of nuclear weapons  the policy of safeguarding peace determines the destiny of mankind. Safeguarding peace is the common goal of all democratic forces in my country. Safeguarding peace is more than avoiding war. Through the renunciation of force and the peaceful settlement of conflicts we must build a world of partnership. The member countries of' the European Community have embarked upon that path. Twice in this century they have been embroiled in war. Today  the Europe of the nine countries has become a force for peace in the world. In the North Atlantic Alliance the democracies of Europe and North America have united to secure peace. The European Community and the North Atlantic Alliance  in turn  provided the firm foundations from which it became possible to launch the process of East-West detente.106.	The Federal Republic of Germany has made a substantial contribution to make detente in Europe possible. By means of the treaties of Moscow  Warsaw and Prague  it has opened the way to normal relations with its Eastern neighbours. Within that context  relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union will also in future be of fundamental importance for detente in Europe. We want to develop these relations further.107.	The treaty with the German Democratic Republic on the basis of relations has laid a foundation on which the two German States can live together. Part and parcel of that policy pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany is its declared aim to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will recover its unity in free self-determination. We are certain that  here again  history will show that a nation's will for unity will assert itself. Nobody can elude the logic of history by using ideology as a subterfuge.108.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has carried forward and developed among the 35 participating countries the process of detente that had been initiated bilaterally. The Final Act of Helsinki is a clear rejection of concepts of supremacy. Relations in the whole of Europe are to be based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all States.109.	My Polish colleague  the previous speaker  was right in pointing out that the Federal Republic of Germany and the Polish People's Republic have made progress along the road to normalization. The meeting of Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt with the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party  Mr. Gierek  in Helsinki has given an important impetus to this development.110.	At the forthcoming follow-up Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Belgrade a sober balance-sheet will have to be drawn up as to whether and to what extent the general principles and the specific declarations of intent on economic and humanitarian matters in the Final Act have been put into practice  and what still has to be done.111.	The Federal Government will do its best to ensure that the follow-up Conference will give fresh impetus to detente. The Belgrade Conference must become not the end of the road  but rather a point along the road in the long-term process of detente. There must be no relapse into cold war. That would render further progress impossible and jeopardize what has been achieved so far.112.	Detente in Europe starts from the existing realities. Among those realities are the ties between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany. We shall do everything to secure the viability of West Berlin. West Berlin must fully participate in the process of detente and its progress. In this context the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 is of decisive importance. It must be strictly observed and fully implemented. Berlin is both a symbol and a yardstick of the will for detente and co-operation between East and West.113.	We know that ideological differences will continue to exist between East and West. We are ready for a competition of ideas and achievements. However  detente means that neither side should attempt to impose its system on the other.114.	Beyond their ideological rivalry  East and West have a common interest in safeguarding world peace  in developing mutually beneficial co-operation  and in resolving the problems of the developing countries. The latter need the contributions of the Western and the Eastern industrialized countries in order to master their problems. The developing countries need least of all a transfer of the East-West conflict to their regions.115.	President Carter  in his recent speech in Charleston  defined the goal as follows: Our goal is not to encourage dissension or to re-divide the world into two opposing ideological camps  but to expand the realm of independent  economically self- reliant nations. 116.	A world of partnership can thrive only in a climate of international trust. Such trust presupposes that nations and individuals can live free from fear. They have a right to be secure from the threat or use of force  be it force in the form of political or economic subjugation or be it force of weapons of whatever kind.117.	In 1976 the Western defence alliance demanded that no country build up a higher level of armaments than was required for its defence.118.	The Federal Republic of Germany has from its beginning taken the position that force cannot be a means to settle problems. That is why it actively advocates balanced and controlled disarmament on a world-wide scale. There must be an end to the arms race.119.	We take seriously the task which we assumed when we became a member of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament of the United Nations. From the beginning  we endorsed the initiative to convene a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on disarmament. Even before the non-proliferation Treaty came into being we had renounced nuclear weapons. We consider the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons to be an essential prerequisite for safeguarding peace. As a party to the non-proliferation Treaty  we appeal once more to all States which are still standing aside to accede to the Treaty.120.	The arms race is an enormous waste of resources in a world which ought to concentrate its efforts on the elimination of hunger and distress. Expenditure on armaments amounting to roughly $330 billion in 1976 is a challenge to the common sense and moral conviction of all States.121.	The forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament must clearly show how we can live up to this challenge. It must not bog down in generalities.122.	Besides world-wide endeavours for disarmament  regional efforts are required  especially where the size of the existing military potential makes such action particularly urgent. It is for that reason that the Federal Republic of Germany is actively participating in the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions. Our aims are clear and straightforward: first  we want parity of forces in Central Europe—neither side should have more forces than the other; and  secondly  we want such parity at a lower level. If those aims were to materialize  this would be a step towards greater stability. It could give fresh and strong impetus to the process of detente.123.	In all efforts for disarmament and arms control- world wide and regional—we are conscious of the importance attaching to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. We welcome the efforts made in those negotiations. The progress achieved in the course of those negotiations will have a favourable effect on detente in general and on other endeavours for disarmament and arms control.124.	Developing a world based on partnership presupposes that we settle conflicts by peaceful means. Three conflicts have been on the General Assembly's agenda for a good number of years—those in the Middle East  Cyprus and southern Africa.125.	In the Middle East  a region neighbouring on and closely linked with the members of the European Community  we were relieved to witness the termination of the civil war in the greater part of Lebanon. But there is no peace yet. We appeal to all who are involved in the constant outbursts of fighting in southern Lebanon to lay down their arms at last. This is essential not only for Lebanon itself but also for stability and peace in the whole region.126.	A settlement of the Middle East conflict is of vital importance also to Europe and the world as a whole. Together with its partners in the European Community the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirmed the principles for a solution in the statement on the Middle East made by the European Council in London on 29 June 1977. A just and lasting peace settlement must  starting from Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  give effect to the following principles: it must implement the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; it must respect the right of all States in the region—and that means the right of Israel as well—to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; it must end the territorial occupation which Israel has maintained since 1967; it must take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. In the view of the Federal Republic of Germany  those legitimate rights of the Palestinian people include its rights to self-determination and to give effective expression to its national identity. A solution must therefore take into account the need for a homeland for the Palestinian people.127.	The States members of the European Community have urgently appealed to all parties involved to begin peace negotiations as soon as possible. The Palestinians must participate in those negotiations. The road to negotiations must not be blocked by the unilateral creation of faits accomplis. That is why the Federal Government  in this forum too  comes out against the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories.128.	The Federal Republic of Germany has friendly relations with all States in that region and uses them in its efforts to help to bring about a peaceful settlement. Advantage must be taken of the promising signs which emerged at the beginning of the year. This requires all concerned to show respect for the inalienable rights of the other side. I urgently appeal to all parties to the conflict to be aware of their responsibility for maintaining world peace and to make possible a peace settlement through realism and a spirit of compromise.129.	Stagnation will also have to be overcome at last in the search for a solution of the Cyprus conflict. Any settlement must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The aim of giving the independent Republic of Cyprus a bicommunal and federative structure must and can be attained only through direct negotiations between the two ethnic groups. The Federal Republic of Germany supports the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those negotiations to a successful conclusion under his auspices.130.	In recent years African problems have moved more and more into the forefront of international politics. The policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is unequivocal. We support the independence of the African States; we support racial equality; we are against colonialism  against any kind of racial discrimination and against any attempt to establish  by pursuing power politics from outside  new dependencies in Africa. Having in mind the continuing suppression of the black majorities in southern Africa  President Nyerere once said: Man is so constituted that he will not rest until he feels that he has freedom and the human dignity which goes with it. Otherwise  he will sooner or later fight for his own freedom within his society and for the freedom of his society from outside domination. 131.	The Federal Republic of Germany therefore presses for a peaceful solution of the problems in southern Africa before it is too late—a peaceful change designed to lead all races into a common future of independence and of coexistence based on equality. It is for the community of States which  at the Conferences of Maputo and Lagos  so impressively demonstrated their determination  to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism and racial discrimination in southern Africa. The Federal Republic of Germany shares the objectives of all those who  in liberation movements and elsewhere  champion the cause of self- determination and human rights by peaceful means.132.	As regards Rhodesia  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany supports all international efforts—in particular the Anglo-American initiative—to replace the illegal minority regime and to bring about a speedy and peaceful transfer of power to the black majority.133.	As regards the problem of Namibia  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is actively involved in the initiative of the five Western members of the Security Council designed to prepare the way for Namibia's independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 385 (1976). The citizens of Namibia are to determine their future in general and free elections in which SWAPO is to participate. In this the United Nations has to play an important role. We expect the United Nations to appoint a special representative for the transition of Namibia to independence  and to contribute during the transitional period to the protection of Namibia's internal security and territorial integrity by providing peace-keeping forces. After achieving political independence  Namibia will be faced with the huge task of building up its own economy. In doing so it will need the help of its friends. The Federal Republic of Germany considers this to be an important task.134.	With all the emphasis at its command the Federal Republic of Germany calls for the ending of racial discrimination in the Republic of South Africa. We call for an end to the policy of apartheid  and the policy of  bantustanization  and for the establishment of social  economic and political equality for all sections of the population. That includes the safeguarding of the rights of the minorities.135.	The States members of the European Community have drawn up a code of conduct for European firms in South Africa  designed to give effect to the principle of equal treatment for black and white workers. That is an important step towards the establishment of the economic and social equality of races  wherever we have an opportunity to do so.136.	The Federal Government has reacted with concern to indications that South Africa may plan a nuclear weapons test. We take it that the Government of South Africa will keep to the declarations it has made in the meantime. However  we appeal to it once more to accede to the non-proliferation Treaty in order to dispel any doubt concerning its position.137.	The time for peaceful reform through a constructive dialogue between the races is running out. Further delay  further hesitation  would be bound to result in a racial war which could bring chaos to the whole of southern Africa. We express our sympathy and sorrow for all those who have already become the victims of racial conflict. South Africa can find peace only if it implements human rights for all races.138.	Besides the Middle East  Cyprus  and southern Africa  there are further sources of serious conflict. At present we all think of the fighting and bloodshed in the Horn of Africa. We must make every effort to settle all these other conflicts peacefully  too.139.	A world of peace and partnership is inconceivable if we do not overcome the gap which divides today's world more deeply than any ideological differences—the gap between rich and poor. The challenge for us is to create a new international economic order which will make it possible for all men in all countries to lead a life free from hunger or need. There is also the question of implementing human rights in the social and economic fields.140.	We cannot achieve this new order by discarding existing and proven structures. Such structures must  rather  be steadily developed and in a flexible way adjusted to ever new requirements and conditions. We must preserve the effectiveness of the steering mechanism of the market economy and at the same time ensure for the developing countries both equal participation in world economy and a more than proportionate rate of growth.141.	The search for a new order must be based on the recognition that neither side-neither developing nor industrialized countries—can reach their economic goal alone. The developing countries can step to  their own progress only in a climate of world-wide economic growth. Commodity prices of greater stability  rising exports of finished goods from the developing countries  a larger transfer of resources—all this presupposes that the industrialized countries will return to stable growth. In turn  the industrialized countries also need the impetus of accelerated development to regain stable growth.142.	The international economic order must therefore serve the twofold aim of providing more than proportionate growth rates in the developing countries and stable growth in the industrialized countries. It must be an order based on equality and mutual commitment  in which each group of countries assumes responsibility for the realization of both aims in the awareness that only thus will it be able to attain its own goal.143.	What  specifically  needs to be done? First  all countries must stimulate the growth of the world economy by common effort  without refuelling inflation. There must be no backslide into recession. Following an agreed strategy  the Western industrialized countries should exert every effort to promote continuous non-inflationary growth.144.	Let me point out for the Federal Republic of Germany that the considerable increase in our imports during the past few years has given a strong impetus to the international economy. At the same time  we have also exported stability in terms of our relatively high  stable prices. We will make further determined efforts to stimulate economic activity in our own country.145.	Secondly  we must keep the markets of the industrialized countries open and provide them with further finished goods from the developing countries.146.	The exchange of industrial goods is the most dynamic sector of world trade. It has always offered the best chance for an increase in the export earnings of the developing countries  and will continue to do so.147.	Only a steady increase in exports of finished goods from the developing countries will make it possible for us to overcome the traditional pattern of exchange in which commodities are supplied mainly by the developing countries. In other words  that is the only way in which we can create a structure of equal rights and opportunities.148.	A steady change in the structure of world trade is also in the interests of the industrialized countries. Free trade and world-wide structural reform  instead of economic controls and protectionism  are indispensable elements of progress.149.	The Federal Government cautions against the growing trend towards protectionism  which it considers to be a serious danger for international economic co-operation  in particular the co-operation between industrialized and developing countries.150.	In all organizations to which it belongs  the Federal Republic of Germany therefore speaks out explicitly in favour of free world trade and of unimpeded and growing access to markets. We continue to be staunch supporters of free world trader even though this implies difficult processes of adjustment for some sectors of our own economy.151.	Even during the recession of 1975  we increased our imports of industrial goods from developing countries by 24 per cent and in 1976 by as much as 32 per cent. That trend has continued during the current year.152.	The Federal Republic of Germany ranks first in the world in per capita imports of semi-manufacturers and finished goods from the developing countries. It has also accumulated a foreign trade deficit in its dealings with the developing countries which do not export oil and has thus substantially stimulated their economic growth during the past few years.153.	Thirdly  we must attain more stable commodity prices. The heavy price fluctuations typical of many commodities are harmful to both sides  raw material exporters as well as raw material consumers. In many developing countries such fluctuations prevent a systematic implementation of development plans  while at the same time they cause an increase in cyclical fluctuations in the industrialized countries  thereby leading to slower growth.154.	In concert with its partners in the European Community  and in close consultation with the other Western industrialized countries  the Federal Government actively participates in UNCTAD negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities. It advocates the conclusion of commodity agreements where suitable. It also supports the establishment of a common fund as a key instrument in attaining the agreed objectives of the Integrated Programme.155.	Apart from price stabilization  the Federal Government also advocates measures for the stabilization of export earnings. Such measures are of particular importance for the poorest among the developing countries.156.	We must promote the transfer of technology to the developing countries. Technology must be accessible to all countries without discrimination. This applies equally to the peaceful use of atomic energy.157.	The Federal Republic of Germany is trying to co-operate  on the basis of partnership  in strengthening the capacity of the developing countries to absorb technology. It promotes private investment in developing countries as an important vehicle for the transfer of technology. We must step up the transfer of resources to the developing countries.158.	In 1976 the net capital influx from official and private sources into the non-oil-exporting developing countries reached a total of almost $71 billion  which is double the amount of 1973. This large increase has helped considerably to ease the impact of world recession on the developing countries.159.	During the past few years the Western industrialized countries have reached the target of a total capital transfer of 1 per cent of their national product; the Federal Republic of Germany has exceeded this target with a capital transfer of 1.18 per cent in 1975 and of 1.19 per cent in 1976.160.	It must now be our first priority to increase official assistance. The developing countries and especially the poorest among them are increasingly in need of non-repayable grants and credits on concessional terms. Despite budgetary constraints  the Federal Government has therefore raised  by more than 20 per cent its appropriation for development assistance for the 1978 budget. This rate of growth is twice that of the total budget.161.	The Federal Government takes an active part also in the endeavours to solve the problem of indebtedness of the developing countries. This problem affects some of them in particular. We therefore intend to provide  as before  assistance on a case-by-case basis.162.	Overcoming hunger and need in the developing countries is the great task of our times  and it can be fulfilled only if all countries which are in a position to do so contribute their share to this. At the Downing Street Summit Conference  held in London on 7 and 8 May  the seven major industrialized countries of the West therefore called upon the industrialized socialist countries to contribute to the necessary increase in the transfer of resources to the developing countries. In 1976 development assistance from member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance amounted to less than 25 per cent of the assistance provided by the Federal Republic alone.163.	Access to markets of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance presents a similar picture. Only 4 per cent of the exports from developing countries go to industrialized socialist countries as against close to 75 per cent to member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.164.	The industrialized socialist countries have long been integrated in world economy. They should therefore accept responsibility for a stable and developing world economy. This is also in their own interest.165.	A substantial contribution to the development process can also be made by foreign private investment in providing capital  technology  modern management methods and channels to world markets. This potential can only be used  however  if industrialized and developing countries jointly commit themselves to creating a climate of mutual confidence which will encourage a smooth and continuous flow of foreign investment.166.	This does not only imply legal security for investors. It also means that the companies established with foreign participation are ready to act in harmony with development plans and to refrain from trying to exert any political influence. In this respect  too  the Federal Republic  of Germany is committed to the principle of the sovereignty and independence of all countries.167.	In order to feed a growing world population and to supply an expanding world economy with raw materials  it is imperative that the production of food-stuffs and raw materials should grow at a sufficient and steady pace. The bulk of grain and raw material production is currently concentrated in industrialized countries. On a long-term basis  however  we shall not be able to meet the growing demand unless the developing countries themselves can steadily increase their own production. This is another significant field of co-operation.168.	One of the greatest challenges for us is the energy issue. In the remaining years of this century  the world must manage to switch from oil to new forms of energy. During the transitional period the oil-producing countries bear a special responsibility. The industrialized countries  for their part  must be prepared to exercise the necessary degree of self-discipline without which the task of restricting fuel consumption and of developing alternative sources of energy can never be accomplished.169.	Of key importance for the future of the world economy is the successful conclusion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The exploitation of the mineral resources of the high seas and the sea-bed has become the critical issue of the negotiations. We must establish an international sea-bed regime and we must do so quickly in view of the long lead-time for investments in deep sea mining. This regime must permit rational exploitation of raw materials and meet the interests of all countries-raw material consumers and raw material producers alike. It must not be monopolistic in character and must  give all interested States unqualified access to the mineral resources of the high seas.170.	Development policy must focus on man. Its first priority must therefore be to satisfy basic needs of all men. Not only must growth be accelerated; it must also be appropriately structured. It must focus on such areas where the poor live and seek a living.171.	The assumption that somehow growth also reaches the poor has proved false. Poverty must be fought directly  and we must provide the poor with the ability and the means of working productively.172.	I have singled out a few areas in which we must make real and rapid progress in our search for a new international economic order based on joint responsibility. The Federal Government will strive with all its vigour to achieve such progress.173.	We hope that our efforts will gain additional momentum from the recently established Independent Commission on International Development Issues. We are pleased that a personality of such international renown and broad political experience as Willy Brandt has agreed to head the Commission.174.	A world of partnership must also be a world of respect for human rights and their implementation. In our endeavours to make the world a more human place we must put a halt with all our vigour to the ever multiplying forms of violence. The taking of hostages has become an urgent problem for all mankind.175.	During the last session of the General Assembly the Federal Government therefore proposed an international convention against the taking of hostages.'1 Early deliberations in the Committee which has been requested to prepare the text of a draft convention have confirmed the will for objective co-operation in accomplishing this task.176.	We must continue the work we have begun with all our vigour. I request the General Assembly to extend the Committee's mandate in accordance with its recommendations. We must also make progress in the solution of the complex problem of terrorism. Terrorism in its national and international forms has become a grave danger for all who want to live in peace and freedom. We must jointly fight this danger.177.	During the past year the International Covenants on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights have entered into force. These Covenants are inseparably linked. Freedom from want is no less significant a human right than freedom from fear.178.	It is now a question of applying human rights world-wide. Here again the United Nations must continue to act as a champion. World-wide independent bodies are required. 1 reaffirm what I said last year concerning the tasks of an international court for human rights.179.	Let us always remember that the concept of human rights is the irresistible force of the modern world to which the future belongs. The implementation of human rights alone will be the yardstick by which progress in the world is measured. "
"38",1942,"DNK",32,1977,"﻿139.	The general debate at the start of the Assembly session is of special importance again this year not only because of the statements made in this hall  which attract the attention of the world public  but also because of the opportunity that the presence of a great number of members of government provides for informal contacts on some of the burning issues in world affairs. I emphasize this aspect because it is perhaps more urgent than ever that these opportunities be used with good will and imagination. In my expectations for this General Assembly  this has been a primary consideration. Therefore I am happy that the Secretary-General also has stressed it in his report this year on the work of the Organization.140.	I should like first of all to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over this Assembly. You have played an important part in the noble efforts of your country to promote understanding between East and West and between North and South. You are thus eminently qualified for the high office with which you have been entrusted.141.	Next I wish to welcome the Republic of Djibouti— our new neighbour in this hall—and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose admission we have strongly and actively supported. We all know the central position of that country in South-East Asia  and we are looking forward to the constructive contribution it can make to the work of this Organization.142.	The United Nations was conceived during the Second World War by nations upon which the war had inflicted unprecedented sufferings and which were now determined that in the future law should replace power in international relations  and conflicts between States should be settled by political and legal procedures  not by military means. Since then certain factors in international developments have reduced the applicability of classic power politics. The explosive development of means of communication now compels every State  big or small  to consider carefully the impact of its actions on world opinion. In this context the existence of the United Nations as a forum for international debate  at the same time reflecting and influencing world public opinion  is extremely important.143.	Three crucial issues in southern Africa are again before us this year in the United Nations.144.	It is the earnest hope of the Danish Government that a free  independent Zimbabwe will emerge in a very short time. Denmark welcomes the proposals for a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe which the United Kingdom recently put forward with the support of the United States. Denmark whole-heartedly associates itself with the objectives of this plan. .The proposals probably represent the last opportunity for a peaceful solution. We note with satisfaction that initial steps to carry out a peaceful settlement are now being taken within the framework of this Organization. Together with the other members of the European Community  we have expressed our support for a peaceful solution. We are firmly convinced that such a solution would be in the best interests  first and foremost  of Zimbabwe but also of the countries and peoples in that region working hard for their development. Denmark has  together with the other Nordic countries  expressed its readiness to assist  within the framework of the United Nations  in the implementation of a peaceful solution.145.	The Danish Government also supports the activity now in progress aiming at a peaceful settlement of the question of Namibia. In this connexion  too  we are ready to offer our services within the framework of this Organization so as to facilitate a peaceful transition.146.	South Africa insists on maintaining its apartheid system. It is deeply disturbing that South Africa cannot see the writing on the wall. Denmark is taking an active part in two regional studies on how increased pressure can be brought to bear on South Africa by wider economic measures and a binding arms embargo. These studies are being carried out by the nine members of the European Community and by the five Nordic countries. Denmark's policy in this respect has been stated on many occasions. The important task before us now is to agree on realistic measures which would be effective and enjoy wide international support. From this General Assembly the message to South Africa must be clear  as the representative of the United Kingdom said a while ago. South Africa faces a choice. South Africa is the one to choose between peaceful and violent change. South Africa has no other choice. Change is inevitable. South Africa has the means to bring about a change which is long overdue and indeed indispensable. This change  if it is to be achieved peacefully  must occur swiftly.147.	We have just learned about the tragic death of yet another victim of South African policy  Mr. Biko  an outstanding champion of non-violence. How many new victims must lose their lives before South Africa feels compelled to abandon this abhorrent policy?148.	As to the tragic conflict in the Middle East  the European Community has tried to offer positive contributions to the peace process. The declaration of the nine European Heads of Government of 29 June this year stressed the need for all parties to show flexibility and to work in a spirit of co-operation. As the President of the Council of the Community said yesterday  we remain convinced that a peace settlement should be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973). It is not through acquisition of territory by force that the security of the region can be assured. Security must be based on commitments to peace by all the parties concerned with a view to establishing truly peaceful relations.149.	We underline the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since 1967.150.	We also underline that the Arab side should be prepared to recognize the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.151.	A solution to the conflict is only possible if it takes into account the need of the Palestinian people for a homeland. The Palestinians  for their part  must agree to live in peace with Israel.152.	We consider it most important that all parties refrain from measures which would make the ongoing peace efforts still more difficult. We have therefore expressed our concern about recent Israeli steps to legalize new settlements in the occupied territories.153.	It is our sincere hope that the ongoing efforts to bring the parties involved to the negotiating table will soon succeed. The Palestinians should be secured participation in the negotiations in a manner to be worked out in consultation with all the parties concerned.154.	In recent years  United Nations efforts to give effect to the human rights provisions of the Charter have concentrated on economic and social rights.155.	The Danish Government welcomes this development  which underlines the close interrelationship between the work to secure respect for human rights and the establishment of a new international economic order. In Denmark we have tried to contribute actively to the promotion of economic and social human rights. This is borne out by our assistance for many years to developing countries  and by our attitude in the North-South dialogue.156.	However  the strengthening of economic and social human rights should go hand in hand with the efforts of the Organization and of Member States to attain respect for civil and political rights.157.	At the focus of the attention of the Danish Government and of Danish public opinion are the many violations of the integrity of the individual that are taking place in many countries in all parts of the world—in all parts of the world. I have in mind particularly acts such as torture  the inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners  the summary execution of political opponents and the many violations of other fundamental human rights  such as persecution on ideological  political or religious grounds. These violations are taking place  overtly or covertly  in spite of the fact that all the States Members of the United Nations have undertaken to promote  in collaboration with the United Nations  the respect for and observance of human rights.158.	Such violations  wherever they occur  are to be condemned. The fundamental principle of respect for the individual  which is a corner-stone of the United Nations Charter and a condition for lasting peace and security  must hold a much more prominent place in the consciousness of all Governments and all peoples.159.	Again  at this General Assembly  Denmark will  therefore  join in efforts to ensure that all people  without discrimination of any kind  enjoy all human rights  and that all States  regardless of their political system  recognize and respect these rights. In our view  the international protection of human rights can best be achieved by legally binding treaties and appropriate international control. We hope  therefore  that all the United Nations human rights instruments will not only be universally adhered to  but also abided by in a manner conducive to general progress towards the realization of the humanitarian goals of the United Nations Charter. Violations of human rights are not only internal matters  but problems of legitimate international concern.160.	We warmly welcome any realistic effort to combat international terrorism. World-wide co-operation in this field is essential. Denmark  like a number of other Member States of this Organization  has already acceded to several important international conventions aimed at preventing and punishing various forms of terrorism. It is our hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  established at the last session of the General Assembly  will be able to produce a result that can obtain general support. We respect the valuable contribution to the prevention of terrorism made each time a government resists the pressure of terrorists.161.	The development of military technology and the stockpile of nuclear arms of enormous destructive capacity have made ruthless military pursuit  of the great-Power interests of earlier times in all parts of the world impossible. They have not  however  ruled out the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe nor the recourse to arms to settle regional disputes.162.	Almost 10 years ago the parties to the non- proliferation Treaty solemnly undertook to halt the nuclear arms race at an early date and to proceed to nuclear disarmament. Since then  we have seen what almost looks like a race against time between diplomacy and military technology  a race in which the odds  I am sorry to say  are against the negotiators. Against this background  we take some comfort in the recent news about progress in the SALT talks. In contrast to many words and simplistic campaigning against the armaments race  these talks  the SALT talks  based as they are on the necessity of maintaining a military balance while negotiating  represent a realistic and constructive peace policy.163.	The special session on disarmament  which is to meet next year  should serve as a much needed catalyst for ongoing arms control and disarmament negotiations at the global  regional and bilateral levels  and should inspire each and every country  whether big or small  allied or non- aligned  nuclear or non-nuclear  to make realistic contributions towards the attainment of our ultimate goal: general and complete disarmament covering both nuclear and conventional arms  under strict and effective international control.164.	The special session will inevitably focus public attention on the intolerable burden which massive arms expenditure places on the economic  social and scientific development of nations. Substantial progress in the field of disarmament could release  for more constructive use  vast material and human resources which are now being absorbed for military purposes. Therefore  we support the Swedish proposal for a thorough United Nations study which would deal with the effect of military spending on all relevant aspects of the economy  and examine methods for the planned reallocation of resources for civilian purposes. In many countries—developing as well as developed— military budgets are a heavy drain on the funds needed for the solution of serious economic problems. Even in wealthy industrialized countries much remains to be done' to improve the quality of the citizens' lives. A step towards this aim could be universal and comparable reductions in military budgets.165.	The North-South dialogue has now moved on to substantive talks on the central elements of a new international economic order. Since the sixth and the seventh special sessions of the General Assembly international economic problems have been discussed extensively at the fourth session of UNCTAD and at a number of United Nations conferences. They have most recently been discussed at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  where agreement was leached on some issues. At this General Assembly and in our future work within the United Nations system we shall try to give substance to the solutions agreed upon the Conference. I pledge the full co-operation of the Danish Government in these negotiations as well as in the further negotiations on the issues in the North-South dialogue which were not solved in Paris.166.	Further progress requires constructive attitudes on the part of all concerned. In all countries—developed as well as developing—public understanding and support are essential conditions for change. This implies an awareness of the necessity to take measures and to supply the means required for achieving a new international economic order. It also implies that the developing countries will continue their work towards a more just and equitable society.167.	A complicating factor is the serious recession and unemployment throughout the developed world. This recession must be overcome  not by protectionist measures as in the past  but by improved international co-operation in the future.168.	Economic instability can ruin any country's development planning and tends to widen the income gap between nations. Greater stability must therefore be a clear goal in our efforts to bring about a new international economic order.169.	As a key element of these efforts I see measures to stabilize the commodity markets for the developing countries. In this context I find it of paramount importance to achieve substantial and satisfactory results at the negotiations on the establishment of a common commodity fund.170.	Reduction of economic vulnerability—not least in the case of developing countries—is also obtainable through diversification of the economic sectors. It is imperative  therefore  that all nations contribute to such a process by the widest possible liberalization of trade and by co-operating in the industrialization process.171.	As for new fields of co-operation I should like  as Mr. Owen did a short while ago  to refer especially to the proposal made by the Secretary-General in respect of the energy sector. We hope that these ideas among others will be included in the discussions of ways in which global energy problems can be further dealt with.172.	In our efforts to create a new international economic order  official development assistance will remain a most important factor  especially in the poorest of the developing countries. The aim should be to promote political independence  and growth not as an aim in itself but in order to advance social progress. At the same time all assistance must be offered without political conditions and with full respect for the integrity of the developing countries concerned. It is the main responsibility of the developing countries themselves to generate and plan the development process. At the same time it must be understood that one of the main objectives of the assistance offered to this process is to implement a basic needs strategy.173.	Regrettably the aid effort of some of the major industrialized countries  in the East as well as in the West  is not commensurate with their economic strength  and they often lag far behind some of the smaller industrialized countries in this respect. We appeal to all developed countries in the East and the West to reach the 0.7 per cent target which is part of the present development strategy. For its part Denmark expects to reach that 0.7 per cent target in 1979.174.	When the United Nations was founded 32 years ago  it had 50 Members. Today  the membership has almost trebled. The quantitative progress is thus impressive  and it is most gratifying to see that the Organization has been able to develop according to the principle of universality which is so essential to its functioning.175.	Representatives of all States have come to accept debate in the United Nations as an important instrument of their foreign policy. The influence of a State no longer depends only on the number of battalions it can muster  but also on the strength of its arguments.176.	The responsibility for safeguarding the security and welfare of our peoples rests upon the Governments of all Member States. Our peoples are entitled to expect effective action of us. As a universal forum the United Nations is unique. Our Governments have here the possibilities of co-operating in living up to these expectations. "

Throughout the regular meetings  our continued concerns and the exigencies of a future which we wish to build despite unforeseeable contingencies  we have had regular opportunities to measure the road yet to be travelled. From year to year  looking ahead on the path to be followed  we witness the closer concern and more attentive responsibility shown by our Organization for the aspirations of our nations  which have long been kept outside the decision-making centres of the world.235.	This sense of dynamism which has been instilled into international life increases our determination to tackle the problems which stand in the way of the necessary changes. We are in the midst of a transitional period when contradictory developments which affect inter-State relations should be regarded as signs of this difficult but long-awaited transition.236.	In particular  the persistence of hotbeds of tension  the arms race  interference in the domestic affairs of States  the economic system based on inequitable trade and exploitation  and the denial to peoples of their most elementary rights are deep-seated roots of an evil which distorts the image created by the ideals of the Charter. Nevertheless  our capacity to break away from anachronistic systems can only be strengthened by the detente entered into between the great Powers  the recourse to democratic dialogue in dealing with key issues  the affirmation of the ties of economic interdependence and the ever-deeper conviction of the world-wide nature of peace  security and prosperity.237.	The nations of the third world  who are the victims of the present order and are facing the problem of their survival  were the first to advocate dialogue with a view to setting up structures to ensure the benefits of harmonious development to all alike on the bases of respect for mutual interests and of sovereignty.238.	In this process  the non-aligned countries have played an active role and have put forward proposals for the establishment of a new international order  the necessity and urgency for which are constantly evident to all of us. It is therefore significant that the debates at this session have been organized in terms of that necessity and urgency  and that they should be presided over by the representative of Yugoslavia  a founding member of the non-aligned movement. Your great country  Mr. President  made a decisive contribution to the awakening of conscience  which  with the advent of decolonization  helped to crystallize the aspirations of the third world. In history the role of harbinger of the emergence and spread of the non-aligned movement  played with such far-sightedness and commitment by President Josip Broz Tito  will be noted.239.	Last year  the General Assembly elected as its President a convinced partisan of non-alignment  our friend Amerasinghe  to whom I take pleasure in reaffirming here our gratitude for the effectiveness and the dedication which he displayed in the course of the thirty-first session.240.	Knowing your experience  Mr. President  your tenacity and your faith in the ideals of the Organization  I am sure that your election  while confirming the universal nature of our movement in this Organization  will give the proceedings of this session a dimension commensurate with the expectations of our peoples and a significance equal to the demands of the time.241.	I cannot of course pay a tribute to the President of the Assembly without emphasizing the outstanding qualities and talents of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose perseverance  self-sacrifice and high- mindedness are a continuous encouragement to the activities of the United Nations.242.	This year the Organization has been enshrined by the admission of two new Members  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. In welcoming these fraternal countries to our ranks  Algeria pays a- tribute to two nations which have won their independence through hard struggle and which are today embarked on the even more arduous task of national reconstruction.243.	The Vietnamese people  whose struggle has brought them into a brotherhood of arms with my own people  have written  through their sacrifice and their long martyrdom  an incomparable chapter in the history of resistance to colonialism and imperialism. That nation has the right to expect of the international community today testimony of the tangible solidarity commensurate with the price it had to pay for its liberation and reunification244.	On that continent of Asia which bears the dreadful seal of the division of nations and the partition of their national territories  may peace be restored to the Indo-China peninsula and may the reunification of Viet Nam which has now been achieved favour the peaceful settlement  free of foreign interference  of the problems of divided countries  and particularly of Korea  which is so close to our hearts and so much a part of our concerns.245.	The people of Djibouti  for its part  steeped in an Afro-Arab civilization which has always rejected alienation  today is rising up in the nobility and dignity it has never lost. It too has afforded the proof  if any proof were necessary  that the greatness of peoples which by definition are dedicated to freedom is measured neither by the size of their territory nor by the numbers of their population.246.	In these last few years international life has undergone qualitative changes in the establishment of new relationships both in terms of the development of political and economic relations and in the codification of standards of law that reflect the changes that have taken place. The resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the super-Powers  their joint statement on the Middle East of 1 October and the climate which has marked the resumption in Belgrade of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe appear to be giving fresh impetus to the trend in favour of detente  although the limits of that movement continue to be seen precisely at the confines of the third world.247.	The ever more frequent use of a policy of fait accompli  the use of force and the destabilization of the three continents of the Southern Hemisphere reflects a retrograde situation which is all the more dangerous to peace and security because  in the final analysis  it will prevent the third world from exercising its natural function in the international balance of power and consequently from making detente as universal as it must of needs be.248.	Before the progress of the African liberation movement  imperialism has attempted  first of all  to call a halt  to decolonization  but that policy is brought to bear wherever its interests are most threatened.249.	While the revolutionary conscience of the peoples of Angola and Mozambique has thwarted these imperialist whims and has foiled the threats and the manoeuvres mounted against their independence  the reality of the system of oppression remains in all its force in the rest of southern Africa. That is the focal-point of the stability of the entire continent.250.	Peace in this area is necessarily contingent upon the elimination of the minority and racist regimes. We must not seek to attenuate the fundamental aspirations of the peoples of the region by drawing up arrangements which reflect rather the concern to safeguard established interests than to satisfy the will to independence of those peoples. In this context  any initiative with a view to negotiating the transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe can have no real meaning unless it culminates in effective independence. The satisfaction of its national rights  embodied in the Patriotic Front  supported by the whole of Africa and principally by the front-line countries  constitutes the central element in any just and lasting settlement.251.	The developments in Namibia are an additional source of concern to the world community. Pretoria  which persists in rejecting the decisions of international bodies  has left the people of Namibia no alternative to intensifying their armed struggle under the leadership of SWAPO in order to win their independence and to preserve their national unity and territorial integrity.252.	In Rhodesia  as in Namibia  the major obstacle to the liberation of southern Africa resides in the behaviour of South Africa. There is no need in regard to action to multiply manoeuvres in order to make people forget that not only Rhodesia and Namibia must accede to independence  but that the apartheid system itself must be eliminated once and for all. A group of Western States  it is true  is now endeavouring to negotiate the transfer of power to the African peoples. It is not our intention to discuss the merits of these initiatives which  in the final analysis  will be judged by their results. But irrespective of the value of these initiatives and the role that our Organization will be called upon to play in its decisive phase  we are concerned about the duplicity of denouncing apartheid while at the same time giving it the economic  material and military means for consolidating the policy of the enslavement of African peoples. We are dismayed by the transfer to the apartheid regime of the most sophisticated military technologies. That is why we are giving close attention to all the twists and turns of that policy  which consists of introducing and exacerbating the factors of dispersal of forces by trying to get artificial credit for the notion of ideological cleavage  for the sole purpose of securing authorized sanction for plans and retribution for manifestly anti-African enterprises. The independence of the African continent having become an international reality of weight and of quality  nothing is spared to separate Africa from its policy of non-alignment253.	To undermine its unity and keep it in a neo-colonial status  imperialism today is attacking the substance and the raison d'etre of the OAU by sowing discord among the African countries  by having recourse to destabilization  and by seeking to pit Africans against Africans  in order to distract them from their fundamental concerns. The principles which constitute the corner-stone of the structure of Africa and which have made it possible to neutralize the stratagems employed by the colonialists  and particularly the principles of self-determination  national unity and the inviolability of frontiers  have become  thanks to complicity in certain quarters  the prime target of the forces of domination and exploitation.254.	In this critical stage through which our continent is passing  the Horn of Africa is another subject of grave concern. Two brotherly peoples and neighbours are engaged in heavy fighting. The Charter of the OAU offers a series of methods for putting an end to the dispute. Algeria  together with other African countries  has not failed to appeal for a peaceful settlement of the problem conducive to the restoration of mutual trust  good neighbourliness and harmony in the region  free from all outside interference.255.	This  however  did not prevent the mutilation of the Comoro archipelago and the violation of the principle of self-determination  the unity of the people and the inviolability of the frontiers inherited from the colonial period. In this ordeal which affects the sovereignty of a people and the dignity of a continent  the Comoros have always been assured of the unanimous and unfailing support of all Africa and of the international community.256.	Who could have imagined that in Western Sahara countries which have themselves undergone colonial rule should have sought to emulate the Powers which in the last century divided up our continent? This is a precedent so grave that any complacency on the part of the international community would lead inevitably to the rule of might over right.257.	If the United Nations wishes to carry out its true mission and to safeguard the immense capital which it has accumulated in defending the ideals of peoples  it cannot do nothing when the very principles on which it is based are in jeopardy. Its responsibility for decolonization is written into the Charter: that is why it has in all relevant resolutions reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Saharan people to self-determination.258.	Recolonized in the age of decolonization  that people is facing the threat of extermination and is struggling to restore universally to the process of decolonization initially laid down by the international community  which is now gravely threatened by two Member States  aided and abetted by the delaying tactics of the administering Power. A veritable war of liberation is going on in Western Sahara  and all the elements of that kind of war are present. The negation of the right of the Saharan people freely to choose its destiny has unfortunately culminated in an enterprise of genocide; in the exodus of thousands of Saharans and in the situation now prevailing in our region.259.	Everyone here is familiar with the colonialist dialectic consisting in denying the existence of peoples  in distorting the meaning of their struggle and in concealing the excesses of the colonialists by ascribing responsibility for them to others.260.	Faced with this tragedy  Algeria has consistently appealed for a restoration of the process of decolonization and for a peaceful solution to the problem based on respect for the principle of self-determination. The United Nations itself has indicated the ways and means of putting an end to a situation which is dangerous for all the peoples of the Maghreb and prejudicial to their highest interests.. It is therefore incumbent upon our Organization to continue its consideration of the question in the context of respect for the principles of the Charter.261.	For its part  Africa  which through the OAU has forged an instrument of unity  solidarity and action to complete decolonization  has not failed to stress the gravity of this problem when it decided to devote an extraordinary summit meeting to it 262.	That must unquestionably be seen as a sign which augurs well in the search for a peaceful solution and will help the Secretary-General of the United Nations to undertake  with the assistance of the other parties concerned and interested  in particular the Saharan people  all necessary initiatives for restoring the rule of law and promoting co-operation among all the peoples of the region.263.	In any event  Algeria declares its readiness to do its share and will spare no effort to bring about a healthy narrowing of differences and a restoration of trust  concord and fraternity.264.	Without any doubt  it is in such a perspective that the various Arab and African mediation attempts have been made  all of which testify to the solidarity of our peoples as they look to a common destiny. We wish to give credit where credit is due and pay a tribute to all concerned  since  despite the manoeuvres of our neighbours and their lack of political wall  they have none the less pursued what they regard as a duty and what we perceive as a noble mission.265.	While Africa  like the United Nations itself  cannot abdicate its responsibilities to the Saharan people in their search for justice  the fact remains that the peoples of the Maghreb have a particular responsibility and bear a particular burden in this regard.266.	In the name of history  of the spiritual and blood ties that bind us  of culture and language  and of solidarity which was forged in the same struggle against colonialism  the peoples of Algeria  Morocco  Tunisia  Libya  Mauritania and Western Sahara have a common destiny  and any action aimed at preventing their progress towards that destiny is a challenge to their unity.267.	That is why the tragedy of the Saharan people is a matter of justifiable concern to all the peoples of the Maghreb  towards all of whom we are committed to practising a policy of brotherhood  co-operation and good-neighbourliness. We must therefore transcend certain narrow chauvinistic concepts in order to envisage our action in terms of a future which is necessarily a communal one and in the building of a Maghreb whole within which the Saharan people can find its rightful place and  together with the other peoples of the region  offer the benefit of its contribution  its national genius and its own individuality.268.	The principle of self-determination of peoples is a key principle of the Charter. To abide by it is not dogmatic; it does not stem from a desire to provoke others or to strike a blow at brotherhood. International law has its own requirements  and one cannot denounce those who violate it when they are our enemies and absolve others in the name of good-neighbourliness and specific bonds. It is thus in being true to itself  to its past and to its recent history that Algeria proclaims for today and for tomorrow its solidarity with the Saharan people on the same footing as with the peoples of Timor  Palestine and southern Africa. That is to say that  in this generous expression of feeling  it is in no way prompted by any animosity towards any country  least of all towards fraternal and neighbouring countries. That also means that the defence of a principle in no way justifies empty accusations. And I should like most solemnly to reaffirm here that  in this matter of Western Sahara  my country has no territorial designs and does not covet anything. To seek to make this problem a bilateral dispute is deliberately to choose  the policy of the ostrich and thus to close one's eyes to a reality which we all know to be painful and distressing.269.	For Algeria the problem of Western Sahara is an international problem  and we all view it as such. At most  our perception is all the more acute because it affects the whole region and weighs heavily on inter-Maghreb relations. To try to reduce a political problem to a humanitarian question or to try to reduce the case of the Saharan people to a mere problem of refugees would indicate a clear wish to distort the facts and to avoid the inescapable logic of our responsibilities to our peoples.270.	The problem of Western- Sahara posed in its real terms and the responsibility of various quarters being clearly depicted  our action would remain incomplete if we failed to explore all the elements of a solution capable of satisfying the aspirations of all the peoples of the region  including  of course  the Saharan people. I should like here to reaffirm that we are entirely available to co-operate with the Secretary-General  in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. He can in any case testify to that willingness since  on his behalf  Mr. Rydbeck of Sweden  to whom I should like once again to pay a tribute  has already experienced it.271.	On another level  the administering Power has proposed a regional formula for dialogue which  if carried out under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Administrative Secretary-General of the OAU  with the participation of all the parties concerned  and  of course  the Frente POLISARIO  the genuine representative of the Saharan people  could constitute an adequate framework for dialogue and  what is more  for the preparation of a just and lasting solution.272.	Our faithfulness to the principle of self-determination is only equalled by our devotion to the policy of fraternity  good-neighbourliness and co-operation. In the age of large groupings  and in the hope that this step could make a substantial contribution to the achievement of African and Arab unity  we are prepared to explore all ways of institutionalizing relations among the countries of the Maghreb within a framework which would preserve the identity and interests of all and which would take account of the unique nature of all the partners  but would not mercilessly or fatally exclude the Saharan people. I say that  despite all misunderstandings  all missed opportunities  we are immediately prepared to undertake a joint search for appropriate formulas  and to reorganize our relations within a general framework that will be in accord with the spirit of our peoples and the characters of our countries.273.	The conflict in the Western Sahara is becoming daily more murderous  and at the same time the burden which it imposes upon the region as a whole is increasingly heavy. It is precisely to prevent disturbances and dispel the clouds that we must consider here  in the OAU and within the Maghreb framework  with the participation of all the interested partners  and principally with the Saharan people  without whom no solution is either viable or conceivable  all possible alternatives to a policy which both the head and the heart refuse. From now on it is clear that a heavy responsibility will lie with any partner who is lacking in vision at a moment when it is becoming vital to rise above the present situation in order to make history.274.	Africa and the Arab world  because they are complementary in all fields and each is an extension of the other  today share a common destiny and face similar trials. The Arab peoples  like the African peoples  are waging a united struggle to eliminate the colonial and neo-colonial systems and foreign occupation. Throughout history they have woven strong and powerful bonds between them and  despite the skill of imperial strategies  they are henceforth aware that the struggles which they are waging have the same meaning  the same objectives  the same allies and the same enemies.275.	That is why Algeria itself feels deeply concerned with the strengthening of co-operation to which Africa and the Arab world have committed themselves. Just as the Arab world has made clear its adherence to that community of common destiny with our continent  so the African countries have understood that the persistence of the conflict in the Middle East is only another example of the constant concern of imperialism to maintain its positions and to protect the strategic and economic interest which it has arrogated to itself around the world through a policy based on the maintenance of tension  despoiling of territories  subjugation of peoples and the seizure of their wealth. As does South Africa elsewhere  Israel constitutes the main instrument of that policy.276.	The latest measures taken by Tel Aviv for the installation of new Zionist settlements in Jordan  and its constant provocations against Lebanon  are aimed at consolidating its aggression against the Palestinian people and its homeland and the fait accompli it has carried out in the other occupied Arab territories. My country is convinced that such a policy cannot be condoned indefinitely by a passive or deliberately dispassionate attitude. Nevertheless  we note with interest the broad international consensus which has emerged for the Palestinian cause and for its justice and the legitimacy of the rights of the Palestinian people  incontestably represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization.277.	As in the case of the Evian talks between the French and the Algerians  then represented by the National Liberation Front  only direct negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization can open the way for a just and lasting solution to the primary cause to which the Middle East problem must constantly be brought back: in other words  the restoration to the Palestinian people of their fundamental rights and the recovery of their historic homeland.278.	That being so  Algeria will nevertheless continue to act in solidarity with the other Arab countries in order to achieve by all possible means the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people and the recovery of the other territories occupied by Israel.279.	While the world community firmly supports recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  it is certainly revealing that the United States of America has finally understood that it cannot install itself in an exclusive position in the Middle East  and that other Powers  if only because of their very nature  also have obvious responsibilities to bear in the maintenance of peace and international security. We are far from sanctioning any idea of trusteeship exercised by any Power  but if the efforts of the United States of America can be influential in the process of restoring peace to the Middle East  then it is quite clear that  if they are joined with those of the Soviet Union  in the spirit of the recent joint statement  they could become decisive. At all events  the Arab peoples  having learned to test their friendships  are now more than ever convinced that their salvation  their freedom and their dignity are essentially based upon the policy of self- reliance. Once these temporary problems are overcome  I am convinced that the Arab world  with its formidable potential and privileged position at the cross-roads of continents and civilizations  with its historic vocation  will once again resume its historic role in bringing peoples together and fostering co-operation among them.280.	In this same Mediterranean basin  where the situation is still explosive  the problem of Cyprus remains unchanged. The negotiations between the two Cypriot communities  conducted under the aegis of our Secretary-General  have unfortunately not yet achieved the hoped-for results. We continue to consider that in this regard the resolution adopted at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly constitutes a continuing valid basis for the satisfactory solution of the question. Such a solution should guarantee to each community its rights  its identity and its security  while maintaining the political unity  territorial integrity  independence and the non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.281.	Nearly four years ago  when the industrialized countries were feeling the boomerang effect of their own policies  for so long based upon negligent waste of natural resources  the countries of the third world addressed a clear and urgent appeal to them  from this same rostrum  to bring about a peaceful revolution in international relations  in order to foster true co-operation between States based on equity  sovereign equality and mutual interest.282.	Analysing the underlying causes of the crisis at the sixth special session and the twenty-ninth regular session  the General Assembly of the United Nations stressed the contradictions which are inherent in the present system of economic relations  and warned against the confrontations which this system inevitably engenders  because it is based upon relations which do not correspond to international political reality or the requirements of a balanced development of the world economy.283.	Thus  invited to choose between dialogue and confrontation  the international community could in fact only choose the one way that would offer fresh prospects of bringing about development of the world economy in the light of the needs of each nation and each individual and their rights and legitimate interests.284.	The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States in this respect offer specific elements for an alternative that would make it possible to establish more equitable relations and-why not? — relations of greater solidarity inspired precisely by the ideals and principles which constitute the philosophical foundation and political raison d'etre of the United Nations.285.	Determined advocates of dialogue as the possible means of bringing about a concerted change in international relations  the countries of the third world have despite the urgency and gravity of their problems done their utmost to ensure success for the seventh special session. They were convinced that the spirit of openness and commitment which prevailed on that occasion would progressively win the day over reservations and hesitations.286.	In accepting  when considering and tackling problems  a certain hierarchical system which took into account the economic situation resulting from the crisis of the industrialized economies and a reasonable arrangement for a smooth transition in the implementation of temporary solutions to bring about the new order  they clearly demonstrated their will to engage in dialogue.287.	Conversely  it appears that with the passage of time the feeling of resignation which accompanied the industrialized countries' adherence to the consensus which emerged around the new order already presaged their concern to gain control over this concept in order to strip it of its true significance. The goal sought by those countries was doubtless to save time in order to patch up the breach that had been opened up by the petroleum exporting countries and in order to attempt to isolate those countries from other developing nations by describing the responsibility for the crisis to them. This attempt to bring about division was aimed at snuffing out the demands of the third world and neutralizing the formidable potential means of action conferred upon it by its natural resources and new political weight.288.	Thus from the very beginning it was feared that the motivations of the parties in the negotiations only concealed divergent strategies despite the professions of faith of the industrialized countries  which had apparently become converted to the idea of a new order.289.	In fact  this ambiguity has not ceased to characterize all the stages of negotiation in recent years. In particular  that explains the results of the Paris Conference on International and Economic Co-operation.290.	In fact  everything leads one to believe that for our partners the objective remains the preservation of the essential foundations of the present order. Doubtless they accept that the world economy must be adjusted to the new circumstances  but such adjustments  if limited to empirical and fragmentary measures  would be contemplated only to the extent that they contributed to the strengthening of the established order.291.	The profound crisis which has been shaking the economies of the capitalist countries  since the end of the 1960s  continues  contrary to all the facts  to be attributed to external and temporary factors  while the difficulties of the developing countries are attributed mainly to the increase in the price of oil and the nature of the internal policies of those countries. This analysis attempts to shirk the historical responsibility of the system in creating under-development and preventing all structural change Thus the measures aimed at correcting  through the appropriate machinery  unequal trade patterns are rejected as contrary to the rules of a market which they try to picture as an objective regulating force and the instrument for ensuring the equitable distribution of resources.292.	If the rules of the market are thus often invoked to reject constructive and innovative proposals from developing countries  the same rules are ignored as soon as it is a question of easing dominant positions and privileges.293.	That is why  even if the industrialized countries agree that a structural shortage of energy is emerging over the short-term  they still refuse to come to the right conclusions as regards price  the instrument which is nevertheless the appropriate one for rational management and distribution whenever there is a shortage. Liberal economic theory itself teaches that only a regular increase in price can prepare the way for an economic solution based on substitutes  since it promotes the development of alternative resources.294.	Similarly  if they refer to the principle of comparative advantage to justify maintenance of the present international division of labour  the industrialized countries ignore those same principles in the name of transient or geopolitical considerations when it is a matter of justifying protectionist barriers and their abusive use of safeguard clauses presented as so many exceptions to the rule.295. In this respect  the failure of the negotiations on the renewal of the Multi-fibre Arrangement illustrate the resumption of protectionist policies and shows how precarious was the progress achieved in the past296.	If it was necessary to judge the North-South dialogue from the point of view of its contribution to the restructuring of the world economy  one would be tempted to say that it’s obvious merit was essentially that it enabled us better to identify the problems and to clarify positions.297.	The specific agreements to which that dialogue led are  with a few exceptions  anything but a confirmation of results already achieved in other international bodies  particularly the Second General Conference of UNIDO in Lima in 1975  the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 and the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi in 1976.298.	On the other hand  these points of agreement or this convergence of positions sometimes concerning important questions such as assistance for development  agriculture  world food security and the common fund  would be improved if they were strengthened and completed in coming negotiations.299.	As regards energy  the most significant progress was the abandonment of the action of recent years in favour of a growing awareness of the true problems posed by the conservation of energy and the preparation of a less threatening future.300.	While international co-operation in the field of energy is desirable it is obviously not possible except on the basis of strict respect for the sovereignty of every State and the principle of mutual advantage. In particular it implies that the industrialized countries will undertake to open their markets to manufactured goods  to provide additional amounts of development financing  and to guarantee non-discriminatory access to their technology  including their nuclear technology.301.	Lastly  is there any need to list the important fields in which there is still much to be done? Here  there are several themes which I think should constitute the main issues for future negotiations in the appropriate bodies of the United Nations system.302.	Real reform of the international monetary system: consideration of the legitimate interests of the developing countries in multilateral trade negotiations: the creation of a joint commodity fund; the adoption of a code of conduct on the transfer of technology; the solution of the problems of indebtedness of the developing countries; the promotion of the industrialization of the third world -this list is not exhaustive—are so many objectives which the international community must set for itself within a reasonable period of time.303.	The establishment of the new international economic order is undoubtedly a fundamentally political objective.304.	Therefore  the technical framework  albeit excellent in all respect in Paris thanks particularly to the marked efforts and the constant attention of the French Government and to the remarkable competence and devotion of the two Co-Chairmen  Mr. Manuel Perez Guerrero and Mr. Allan MacHachen  cannot take the place of the political will of States  which itself can only be fully expressed in this body which brings together the international community as a whole.305.	This year a feature of international life has been the proliferation of more or less dramatic proposals having varying chances of success. They have been put forward apparently to exorcise the deep unease underlying relations between States. Time-tables have been announced  international meetings have been planned  and projects have been advanced in a sudden  pressing desire to solve the most long-standing problems. This is the case in southern Africa: it is the case in the Middle East; and it is the case with the transformation of international economic relations.306.	Clearly  it has become customary to say without emotion  in speaking of international problems  that they will be complex  not to say insoluble  so long as States exist  in an environment where opportunity and risk go hand in hand  where might jostles right  and where mistrust and fear are still natural reflexes in the face of intimidation and violence. In the delicate stage which we are now passing through  changes are obviously necessary. We must accept this and facilitate their occurrence because they themselves are a promise of the settlement of the problems linked with emergence in the national arena of a third world that was for too long exploited and exiled from the mainstream of history.307.	Our Organization has been able in a difficult context to assume a role which no other body can assume in its place; that of setting objectives- at the level of general interest and offering the alternative of dialogue and negotiation to the dangerous temptation of solutions by force. It is called upon to evolve and to adapt in accordance with its determination to accomplish its vocation. It can only survive and be consolidated through the necessary combining of our efforts.  "
"40",2080,"ECU",32,1977,"﻿1.	 I am happy to express to you  Sir  the satisfaction of the Government of Ecuador upon your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-second session. That decision represents an express recognition by the Assembly of the dynamic international career of Yugoslavia  as well as of your own qualities.2.	I also wish to join in congratulating Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for the efficient and impartial way he led the deliberations of the General Assembly at its last session.3.	My praise goes also to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose judicious re-election is the best proof of the wide support and general trust which his tireless efforts have earned him in the search for international peace  understanding and co-operation.4.	I should also like to extend a cordial welcome to the two new Members of our Organization and wish them well on the road followed by free peoples: Viet Nam  which has reached complete independence after a relentless and heroic struggle over the last few generations  and Djibouti  now attaining full self-government  the administering Power having discharged its responsibilities towards it. The presence of these two States among us brings the United Nations closer to the ideal of universality which my country has always  at all times  most whole-heartedly supported.5.	In the field of foreign relations  every day brings more evidence of the fact that political questions are closely linked to socio-economic matters. One can rightly state that there can be no peace in the world unless at the same time States are willing  on the one hand  to co-operate in solving  the problems stemming from international tension which are always a threat to mankind and a possible cause of armed conflict  or worse still  of a nuclear holocaust  and  on the other hand  to decide to work unceasingly in order to set international economic relations on a foundation of justice and equity and thus contribute to a reduction of the appalling gap between rich and poor peoples. While it is true that peace is the essence of order and the basis for the development of the nobler qualities of the individual  it is also the result of a desire for justice which must inspire all countries  large and small alike  for none can feel removed from the problems which are at the root of international tension  in political as well as economic matters.6.	The United Nations is the contractual expression of this decision. As such  it must be involved in the review and negotiation of every question  whenever collective action proves to be the most appropriate way of stimulating the will to find solutions and thus paving the way towards peace and progress for mankind. For this reason  Ecuador has always sought to strengthen the world Organization  aware as it is of the fact that its fundamental task  as required by the Charter  is to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends  these being the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security; the relaxation of international tension  based on the solution of existing problems by peaceful means; the matter of disarmament in general and the limitation of arms purchases; the achievement of effective international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian nature; and the furtherance and promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.7.	Within the world Organization  to which Ecuador once again pledges its support  my country will continue  moreover  to follow a policy of friendship and co-operation with all others  on the basis of the principles of mutual respect and solidarity in dealing with the problems of mankind.8.	The question of disarmament  one of the constant sources of concern to the United Nations  has been the focal-point of its debates and the object of the aspirations of all peace-loving peoples of the world.9.	It is in the area of general and complete disarmament that the United Nations commitment to improve conditions for mankind is of the greatest importance; yet it is also the area where the least progress has been registered. The peoples of the world view with alarm the fact that a sum of more that $334 billion is spent on destruction every year  funds which could be put to much better use in improving the quality of life. The arms race  both nuclear and conventional  is an expensive aberration whose price  paid in terms of lives and universal regression  is the senseless offering that mankind makes to death and destruction.10.	The new and deadly weapons  born of the fertile imagination of scientists  are designed to wipe out all trace of life by making it impossible for the civilian population to find shelter from them; yet these weapons carry the ironic advantage of sparing property.11.	Ecuador believes that it is essential for the international community to give due attention to all the problems which are or could be a cause for the appearance of tensions or for a breach of the peace. The community's peace-keeping activity must prevent conflicts from worsening; it is everyone's responsibility to preserve and maintain international peace and security; it is the common duty to ensure that disputes arising between countries are settled reasonably and justly.12.	While it is undeniably true that the major Powers carry the prime responsibility in this matter  it is nevertheless disquieting to note their growing tendency to handle questions of disarmament on a bilateral basis: this is a problem that affects all members of the international community and concerns their security interests. The small and medium-sized countries cannot remain indifferent and passive in matters of disarmament: such matters are not the preserve of specific Powers  or of the exclusive  but not excluding   Atomic Club . The future and the very survival of mankind are at stake  and no one has been assigned the role of warden in deciding the fate of mankind.13.	That is why people attach particular importance to what is happening in the United Nations. For this reason  Ecuador attaches particular importance to the next special session of the General Assembly on disarmament and sees it as a great opportunity to direct the efforts of all nations towards the search for solutions which will expedite the negotiations that have been aiming at general and complete disarmament under effective international control.14.	For all these reasons  Ecuador has given close attention to the report prepared by the Group of Consultant Experts on the economic and social consequences of the arms race and of military expenditures . Acting with deep pacifist conviction  it has supported the resolutions pertaining to the banning of incendiary weapons and the need to put a stop to nuclear testing  to the banning of the use of chemical as well as bacteriological weapons and also of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction. Ecuador has supported the purposes and objectives of the Disarmament Decade and will continue to do so unconditionally.15.	By virtue of its equatorial location  my country views with particular interest the scientific progress in the field of outer-space exploration; this opens up new prospects for the improvement of man's life on this planet. Ecuador hopes to become a member of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and asks for the Assembly's support in order that its hopes in this regard may be fulfilled. We have already participated in the Committee's work as observers. In its Legal Sub-Committee this yearEcuador once more stated its reasons for declaring  together with other equatorial States  its will to exercise its sovereignty over the segments of the geostationary synchronous orbit which are located above its continental  maritime and insular territory. We are determined to maintain this position despite any obstacle that may be put in our way  in regard to this matter of natural resources such as the geostationary orbit. I am bound also to state at this time that such an orbit is a separate and different entity from outer space  the latter- being a concept for which the States have not yet found a valid and satisfactory definition.16.	A few days ago my country celebrated with Chile and Peru the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Maritime Zone which the three nations signed in Santiago on 18 August 1952; This Declaration proclaimed  as a norm of the international maritime policy of the signatories  that each of them wields exclusive sovereignty and extends its jurisdiction over the sea to a distance of 200 miles  the purpose being  first and foremost  to preserve the resources of the maritime zone for the benefit of their respective peoples. We are pleased that those principles proclaimed in Santiago have received universal support and that the countries of the entire world have made them an irreversible reality. Ecuador will continue to maintain its well- known position  as stated in all forums and especially at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  that it wishes to reaffirm its claims in this regard: they have become a national reality  established and applied for a quarter of a century  and they are in no way contrary to the jus communicationis  as it is practised by all countries around the world.17.	On the question of the Middle East  Ecuador expresses its most sincere hope that Arabs and Israelis will gather as soon as possible around the negotiating table in Geneva. The tension in that part of the world has been most acute and has lasted for too long; the chances that this situation will degenerate into a major conflict increase with each passing day. Occupation by force does not create any rights; therefore the territories held must be returned promptly  and the work done to establish Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab zones must be undone. At the same time there must be full recognition of the State of Israel  created by the United Nations  just as the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  independence and sovereignty and to an effective geographical location must also be recognized.18.	The time has come for all people of Mediterranean culture to live together in peace  sharing the opportunity for progress in co-operation with all in the service of the people's interest; therefore it is essential that a global and just settlement of this problem be reached within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly.19.	On the question of Cyprus  my country hopes that both Cypriot communities will reach an agreement  free from any external pressure or interference  that will enable them to live together in brotherhood and in peace. Ecuador pays tribute to the memory of the late Archbishop Makarios  President of Cyprus.20.	My country condemns racial discrimination  which is a problem that has been overcome in our midst  and it energetically condemns apartheid as a crime against humanity. It further believes that the attitude of defiance and disregard for the United Nations resolutions on the part of South Africa creates a situation which threatens the integrity of the system of international law.21.	Ecuador is concerned at the tense situation prevailing in southern Africa  which makes for a permanent state of insecurity and anxiety  not only in the whole area  but even at the world level. The continued illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia flouts the principles of the Charter and defies the resolutions of the world Organization. Ecuador therefore stresses once again the urgent need for strict compliance with Security Council resolution 385 (1976).22.	My country is also following with close attention the developments in Zimbabwe. Faithful to its principles  it disapproves the continuing attitude of the white racist minority which  for many years  has prevented the majority of the population from exercising its right to decide its own future. It is therefore essential that new measures be taken to solve the problem and that Member States show the necessary political will to apply strictly the resolutions of the Security Council which provide for sanctions against that regime.23.	A few days ago  the mandated officials of the American States met in Washington to solemnize by their presence the signature of new instruments concerning the Panama Canal. The negotiations that led up to this event represent a positive step forward towards the solution of one of the problems most adversely affecting relations between nations in the hemisphere. The President of the Supreme Governing Council of Ecuador  commenting on this historical and auspicious event  said: Besides putting an end to a serious international problem  the signing of the new treaties is a demonstration of the fact that through fair and honest negotiations  as well as through persistent peaceful dialogue  it is possible to settle the problems and disputes still outstanding in Latin America. 24.	Just as peace and security are inseparable  and breaches or threats of breaches thereof  wherever they may come from  affect and concern all members of the international community  so the disputes that divide these nations are a legitimate cause for concern not only for the parties directly involved  but also for most nations  particularly for those who live in the same region or continent  where a greater impact is felt from the harmful effects of straying from the path of co-operation and the potential consequences in terms of breaches of the peace that inevitably arise from those disputes that remain unresolved.25.	The  spirit of Washington   particularly noteworthy because of the support it received from the whole of America in the solution of the question of Panama  must continue to inspire all those involved in other outstanding problems on our continent  in order to strengthen the atmosphere of full trust  perfect harmony and sincere co-operation that must exist among all peoples who build their future on the soil of the Americas.26.	Ecuador therefore seeks  through a frank and cordial dialogue initiated with Peru  a goodwill agreement that would effect a satisfactory solution to its territorial claim  in line with the requirements of its national honour and of its destiny in the Amazon river basin.27.	Respect for human rights and human dignity  both nationally and internationally  is a principle which is ingrained in the Ecuadorian nation.28.	Ecuador deems the promotion of human rights to be a matter that does not exclusively concern each individual State  but involves the responsibility of the formally organized world community.29.	My country believes that individual Member States  as well as the world Organization and the other international organizations  must see to it that human rights are fully observed; this excludes violence  torture and terror  and also poverty and its consequent subhuman conditions. We consider that the all important quality of human rights lies in their very universality. It should be possible to arrange  in the United Nations  for the yearly presentation of a report on the situation with regard to human rights; there would thus be a general critique  or a general expression of appreciation and encouragement  as the case may be— violation or observance—for the particular country' concerned. However  the present practice of preferential treatment  with obvious bias in some cases and significant silence in others  cannot continue without prejudice to the system.30.	In any case  the subject of human rights is not in any way negotiable  and it must not. therefore  be used as a means of applying pressure for obtaining advantages in other fields of international relations  such as security  or economic and technical co-operation.31.	Full protection of the human being is only possible through unrestricted observance of his civil  political  social  economic and cultural rights on the national level and  on the international level  through the establishment of a new international economic order  which will give effect  with equity and justice  to the safeguards enshrined in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.32.	My country submitted its report on human rights to the appropriate organs of the international system  whose competence it recognizes. They in turn have shown satisfaction at the way human rights are observed in Ecuador and at the implementation of the legislation which protects them. They have also shown their satisfaction in respect of our plan for the legal restructuring of the State  whose implementation is progressing normally  and which will enable the Ecuadorian people to return to a constitutional regime in the near future.33.	Ecuador reaffirms its firm decision in favour of the full implementation of the new international economic order and regrets that for lack of an agreement in the first half of the Decade  the world should have found itself witnessing dangerous confrontations that may affect the entire world population  unless the developed countries implement the measures laid down for reaching the specific objectives of the International Development Strategy.34.	My Government endorses the principle that requires international economic relations to be based on the sovereign equality of all States  with the full and effective participation of all countries in finding the solution to world economic problems  and on the right of each country to adopt the economic and social system which it deems most appropriate. In that context  we ask for the speedy establishment of a fair and just price relationship between the prices of raw materials and of manufactured goods  while at the same time we encourage the influence of the producers' associations that are pursuing the same ends.35.	Ecuador hopes to see international co-operation applied to the elimination of discriminatory practices against producers' associations in countries that export raw materials.36.	The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States is an international instrument which makes it possible effectively to protect natural resources  which are the lifeline of future generations  and helps control the entry of foreign capital and technology  with full regard being given to the sovereignty and the laws of each State.37.	Ecuador is aware of the problems caused by the shortage of energy which affect the world today  and of the projected cumulative effect of such shortages in the future; it therefore notes with interest the proposals of the Secretary-General to make a technical study of this factor of human progress  since my country is in the process of acquiring the technology and other necessary elements to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  as befits its tradition and its international commitments.38.	On the other hand  my country observes with concern the progress of negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities within the framework of UNCTAD. The length of the negotiations relating to the commodities listed in the Integrated Programme is in itself evidence of the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries which  despite their protestations of goodwill  have not taken any significant steps to resolve  even partly  the current international trade crisis. Ecuador hopes that the negotiations on the Integrated Programme's common fund will be brought to a favourable conclusion and expects to see a consolidation of the required machinery to set such a programme in motion.39.	My Government appeals to the stronger countries  asking them to show the necessary political will in the negotiations which are due to start next November  on the establishment of the common fund for financing commodity buffer stocks  which will benefit not only the weak countries  but also the world economy as a whole.40.	Ecuador earnestly requests the political support of the international community to help bring the negotiations on the sugar and banana agreements  in particular  to an early conclusion  since it was noted  during the negotiations that took place in Geneva and Rome respectively  that the industrialized countries did not give the support necessary for the drafting and signature of such instruments.41.	Looking back on the results of the negotiations that brought together industrialized and developing countries  particularly the North-South dialogue held during the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  it is disheartening to see how limited the results were in terms of basic global policy matters that might have opened better prospects for international economic relations. There can be no isolated policies applicable only to certain aspects of development  nor can there be only transitional measures that are mere palliatives to hunger  poverty and the unequal distribution of wealth  ever present in the world today.42.	The North-South dialogue has not yet ended. Though it started in Paris  it will continue in its natural and universal forum  at the United Nations  which was established for consultation and negotiation and the search for global solutions by consensus likely to guide economic relations and encourage co-operation on the basis of justice.43.	It is the responsibility of the present General Assembly to define a clear mandate and establish a forum for the negotiations that are to follow those initiated in Paris and bring them to a successful conclusion.44.	My country has full confidence in the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations; above all  it considers that the Economic and Social Council must be strengthened so that it may really become the most important operational arm of the international community  upon which the hopes of the needy peoples are founded. The Council must undertake specific tasks in order to rise to the great challenges of our time without dissipating it's action through subsidiary bodies. Its role must be strengthened constantly as the co-ordinator of action and the policy director of the United Nations system  faced as it is with the broad array of action by the specialized agencies of the system. Full use has not yet been made of the possibilities available under Articles 62  63 and 64 of the Charter.45.	In this regard  a matter of great concern is the total absence of representation by the Latin American countries at the top levels of the specialized agencies  and this does not meet the criteria of universality or of equitable geographical distribution at levels of real significance.46.	Ecuador believes that the dynamic and respected presence of the international community is felt in the developing countries through the operational activities of the United Nations. Consequently  it endorses the process of strengthening of UNDP and of its function of co-ordination  in support of the plans formulated by Governments in exercise- of their sovereign rights; it also feels that the Resident Representatives should also be representatives of the Secretary-General.47.	A serious cause for concern to Ecuador is the current of opinion that holds that resources should be reduced for the countries which have reached the midway point in the process of development  without withdrawing the sources of support from the most backward countries on the scale. Such a thesis cannot be accepted if it means withdrawal of international co-operation from the whole of the Latin American region is the very moment when it is making its most determined effort to find its way to well-being  with full utilization of its natural and human resources  while the technological gap keeps widening alarmingly  separating the advanced countries of the industrial world and those of our region which still depend on markets that offer unfair prices for our raw materials. Ecuador will resolutely oppose any action that implies technological neo-colonialism aimed at withdrawing resources from the Latin American region  on the pretext of concentrating those resources entirely on the world's poorest countries.48.	Meanwhile  the undertaking by the major countries to contribute 1 per cent of their gross national product to the transfer of resources to the developing world  has still not been implemented  save for two or three rare  honourable exceptions. The major countries still remain deaf to this call for justice which requires such a transfer to be made for the safeguard of world peace  under the new international economic order. The aid received by the developing countries helps the great nations who supply this aid to discharge their duties of co-operation in our interdependent world. Thus it is that Latin America  for instance  has started to transfer to other countries  particularly to those that have most recently reached independence  the results of its experience of one and a half centuries of independent life and 32 years of persevering action within the United Nations system.49.	Finally  I believe that it is necessary to underscore the activities relating to the drafting of a code of conduct for transnational corporations and the work of the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations  of which my Government has taken particular note. Ecuador confirms on this occasion that it is convinced that an instrument of such importance should be fully binding in law.50.	Ecuador places its full trust in the United Nations  and in its responsibility in the matter of peace  understanding  international co-operation and the safeguards of coexistence for all countries  large and small. The world Organization offers the best  if not the last  historical opportunity for the survival and progress of the human race  and all countries—not only the great Powers—must use their energy and apply the full force of their will to achieve understanding  without wasting time over matters of procedure  in order to meet the closely interwoven  multiple challenge of insecurity  aggression and under-development  and thus bring about in our generation the realization of a world of justice arid peace.

"41",2125,"EGY",32,1977,"﻿80.	 Mr. President  it gives me pleasure to begin by offering you sincerest and heartfelt congratulations on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly  which is of great importance in the history of the United Nations. There is no doubt that your election is an expression of unanimous appreciation of your outstanding efficiency and experience. It is at the same time a tribute to your friendly country and its great leader  President Tito  whose struggle and achievements represent a brilliant chapter in the history of human endeavour.81.	I should also like to commend the tremendous efforts exerted by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and his concern for advancing the credibility of the Organization  seeking to ensure an active and effective role for it in the service of the cause of peace  progress and the positive co-operation of peoples. As the Secretary-General stated in his report on the work of the Organization:  It is dangerous if the Organization becomes complacent  set in its ways  unresponsive to new ideas or irrelevant to contemporary issues.82.	It is with happiness and pride that I welcome the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as Members of the United Nations family  a membership which crowns the struggle of those two friendly peoples for their national independence and self-determination. No one doubts that these two countries will contribute actively and positively to the enhancement of the Organization's role and to the fulfilment of its mission.83.	The independence of those two peoples is a clear indication and a reminder to us all here of the inevitability of the triumph of the will of peoples still struggling for the right to self-determination and to eliminate subjugation and domination. I should like to mention specifically here the Arab people of Palestine and the brotherly African peoples in Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa.84.	Our meeting here at this time gives each of us an opportunity to present the broad lines of his country's foreign policy and the role of his country on the international scene as it sees it  as well as its views on the vitalquestions affecting world security  peace and prosperity  whether those questions be political  relating to the balance between countries; or economic  relating to the life and future of peoples; or social  relating to the dignity of the individual and group  and to ways of preserving this dignity in a sound and healthy environment and an atmosphere favourable for development in the interests of this generation and for ensuring a happier future for the coming generations.85.	The General Assembly is probably aware that Egypt voluntarily shoulders a great responsibility. It is a responsibility which stems from its unique strategic position as a link between the continents  a bastion of peace in a region which has been and still is exposed to plots and conspiracies  and a torch of civilization in the heart of the Arab world and in the northern part of the great African continent. This prompts Egypt to defend Arab and African interests against any aggression against the Arab  African or non-aligned peoples  to whom we are bound by unity of principles  policy and interests as well as by u common view of the role of the peoples of the third world at present.86.	All this requires considerable sacrifices on the part of the Egyptian people  who make them willingly. With their historical awareness from time immemorial  the Egyptian people have come to realize the unity of the human struggle against oppression  domination and exploitation They have come to realize that repelling any aggression against a brotherly people means defending their own existence  values and civilization.87.	This pioneering role naturally means that it is necessary for Egypt to be zealous in maintaining and safeguarding its independence and making certain that it is not marred by anything; that its will is free and is /inspired only by right  justice and peace  Such free will can emanate only from the collective conscience of the nation to which it belongs and can rely only on its own ability to give  on the solidarity of its sister countries in all situations  and on their willingness to stand by it  whatever the sacrifices may be.88.	It is no mere coincidence that Egypt was among the pioneers of non-alignment or that it suffered a great deal for its resistance to alliances  spheres of influence and attempts to dominate. It became the prop and pillar of independence movements in the Arab world and on the African continent  movements which led those peoples to the path of victory and liberty. Egypt sought to lead freedom-loving peoples everywhere.89.	Hence  President Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat was concerned to ensure that the policy of Egypt should emanate from its heritage  its soil and its values  should be guided by its interests and the interests of those that stand by it  and should pursue a policy based on peace  freedom and brotherhood among all nations and peoples. The first prerequisite for an independent will is that the people should have the upper hand and that no Power should have a special privilege that contravenes the principle of equality and mutual co-operation among countries  or makes the will of one party subject to the will and influence of the other.90.	That is not an easy matter  because the preservation of independence and free will entails tremendous responsibilities and consequences. The exercise of independence also requires great vigilance and a delicate balance  since we live in an era of complexity and interdependence  and no one can live in a vacuum or aloof from events in the world  even if he so desires. The big challenge facing us all today is not one of inwardness or isolationism  but of openness and the ability to deal with all without complexes or undue sensitivity and without contravening the national will or the supreme national interest.91.	It is on the basis of this concept that Egypt follows a policy of openness everywhere in the world  in the east and west  and in the north and south  and is willing to deal with and react to all without fanaticism or discrimination  as long as they adhere to the principle of international legitimacy and as long as they are ready to respond truly to Egypt on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in domestic affairs or in matters relating to sovereignty and the free will of our people. Egypt's policy in this respect is clear  stable and unwavering. Egypt adheres to principles  respects pledges and establishes its international relations on objective bases that are easily recognizable  comprehensible and feasible. In short  any country ready to respect its international obligations and to adhere to the rules of legitimacy can establish healthy and good relations with Egypt to the mutual benefit of both countries and for the ultimate benefit of the international community.92.	Bearing all this in mind  Egypt participated with great interest in the North-South dialogue held in Paris between December 1975 and June 1977 with the object of considering and reviewing the foundations of a new international economic order.93.	Egypt  along with other developing countries  considers that the problem of development cannot be solved in isolation from other international economic problems. These problems must therefore be looked into as a whole and their solution tackled in an integrated manner. There exists an obvious and inevitable interrelationship between the problems of development and those of trade and finance. Furthermore  international trade and development assistance should serve the objectives of industrialization and of the transfer of advanced technology to developing countries  it is also imperative that we continue the dialogue to reach agreement on the measures necessary to combat international inflation  which is a phenomenon indicative of a serious disease that has spread to the economies of developing countries at a crucial stage  when those economies can hardly sustain fluctuations  or the feverish and uncontrolled rise in development costs.94.	We believe that developing countries can  among themselves  create a momentum towards greater international economic co-operation. I wish  in this connection  to refer particularly to the positive results of the First Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States  held in Cairo from 7 to 9 March 1977  which was in effect the first serious and practical application of the principle of economic co-operation among developing countries.95.	The African continent  which for so long was the victim of imperialistic conspiracies and foreign exploitation  at present is witness to dangerous developments. It is therefore incumbent upon us to confront these developments with vigour and firmness if we are to succeed in sparing the African continent further suffering and conflict. I wish to refer briefly to those developments.96.	First  foreign intervention  instead of disappearing with the ebb of colonialism  is reappearing under various pretexts again in Africa  though disguised in other forms. The fact still remains that all foreign intervention in Africa is unacceptable  for it goes against the interest of the peoples and can only lead to an escalation of conflict and factionalism as well as to the creation of new areas of tension. Intervention always aims at the creation of a climate that guarantees its perpetuation and growth. Hence it becomes like an infiltrating malignancy that cannot be uprooted without difficulty  nor can its grave consequences be easily eliminated.97.	Secondly  the racist regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa  notwithstanding world public opinion and its unanimous condemnation of their policies and practices in violation of human rights and in breach of the principles recognized by civilized nations  are persisting in their policies of aggression  intimidation and terroristic atrocities.98.	These two regimes are adamant in their irresponsible behaviour and refuse to recognize the right of peoples to self-determination. I believe that we all agree that the international community cannot stand idly by faced with this untenable situation  a situation where a man lives as an alien in his own homeland  subjugated by those who have usurped his rights. We must be honest with ourselves and hence we must t be committed to securing the total isolation of the illegal Smith racist regime  in conformity with Security Council resolution 409(1977)  adopted in May 1977. We also have to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 385 (1976) on Namibia and the termination of the illegal presence of South Africa in that Territory. We are in duty bound to stand firm in the face of the aggressive governing regime of South Africa and to put an end to its crimes  the latest of which was the assignation of an honest freedom fighter  who was cruelly and savagely tortured.99.	It is an axiom of history that the peoples of the Middle East  the cradle of civilizations and the place of origin of divine religions  have for ages lived in peace  harmony and brotherhood. There was no place for rancour or bigotry. Coexistence and interaction were the fertile soil from which civilizations burgeoned and where all differences between peoples vanished. The Middle East was in fact a melting-pot of historical perspective. Two fundamental phenomena prevailed: plurality as a basic manifestation of the civilization of man and his evolution  and tolerance as a prerequisite for the continuance of humanity.100.	Yet  all of a sudden  this ideal situation was disturbed when  from outside the area  an adverse wind blew  sustained by the ambitions and conspiracies of those who had colonized and exploited the countries and the peoples of the area. The methods and objectives of the colonizers coincided with those of a racist movement originating outside the area. Both parties were bent on aggression against a whole people in order to usurp their rights  to threaten their very existence and to impose upon them a forced exile. That aggression was further extended to include other countries in the area  to the point where their people felt menaced in their lands  their values  their heritage and their civilization.101.	That is what happened in the past; it is what is happening today and what some quarters think will continue to happen in the future  in defiance of the lessons of history. It has imposed on the Middle East a unique situation: nothing less than a continuous state of war that has lasted for more than 30 years/ It is like a volcano which erupts at regular intervals  with all that that entails in human suffering and danger and misery for the people. In this respect it is worse even than those global wars that have erupted in certain parts of the world in certain periods and later petered out. A state of war such as that prevailing in the Middle East creates a material and psychological climate that is detrimental to stability and an obstacle to progress and prosperity: everything depends upon the unknown. The Middle East has accordingly been destined to a continuous sapping of its human and material resources and to a regrettable waste of energy and potential. Consequently  and as a result of a situation created by the unholy alliance of Zionism and imperialism  an unhealthy atmosphere prevails in the area  where hopes are shattered and fear and rancour are intensified. The situation in the area is further aggravated by the increasingly aggressive intentions of the alien  racist Zionist entity  whose appetite for aggression increases with every right it usurps and every territory it occupies.102.	That is the truth of the situation in the Middle East and the root of all past  present and future trouble in the area. It is therefore inevitable that if the situation remains stagnant an explosion will occur  and that explosion will dwarf all previous ones and no one in the world will be safe from its devastating material  spiritual and moral consequences.103.	Let it be clear that the Arab nation has potential that can be mobilized and deployed in any conflict that may be forced on it  notwithstanding the recognized Arab endeavour to replace conflict and the state of  no war  no peace  in the Middle East with a peace based on justice.104.	No one can have any doubt that the Arab countries will stand hand in hand and respond as one at the right time and will in the most opportune manner repel any aggression against it  regardless of its source. It is only a question of time.105.	We are entitled to ask whether such a situation can continue  and until when  and whether it is admissible to say we are incapable of dealing with it. We may also ask about the party responsible for all the tension  violence and suffering. Does responsibility lie with the party that has since the dawn of history lived in peace with others  or does it lie with the party that has made of aggression a philosophy and of occupation a national claim linked to historic rights-the party that relates racism to divine belief? A glance at the events in the Middle East since 1947 and even earlier makes it evident that one party has taken it upon itself to launch aggressive war at regular intervals and to prepare for such war under a heavy smoke-screen of duplicity and hollow propaganda  deluding itself that it has succeeded in fooling the world. In this false belief it claims that its aggression is actually self-defence  that its expansionism is motivated by the need to ensure its continued existence and that occupation and the uprooting of a whole people is essential to the coexistence of peoples and nations.106.	We are entitled to ask whether the aggressor has learned anything from the lessons of history and from the experience of other countries which have been exposed to similar storms. How can the aggressor make coherent its contradictory claims—for instance  the claim that it desires to live in peace  and its insistence upon occupation and expansion? Is it admissible that it claims we should acquiesce in its  right to live in peace  while it is still occupying our territory and refusing in a manner unprecedented in history to acknowledge the rights of a whole people? What kind of coexistence is based upon occupation and domination? Are we expected to recognize those who do not even recognize the basic principles of law and human rights?107.	Israel's leaders never cease to speak of peace  but they are not sincere in their intentions. They claim they seek coexistence and that the transition from a state of war to normal relations can be completed overnight. Even in this empty propagandists exercise they offer no peace; in effect they propose the establishment of abnormal relations under conditions of occupation and expansion and the violation of rights. The worst thing .about this behaviour is that it insults our intelligence as well as our ability to distinguish between right and wrong. If the Israeli leaders were genuine in their call  those among them who pay lip-service to peace would not have permitted themselves to declare daily that they insist on annexing territories and ignoring the existence of the people who have been  and still are  the owners of the land and have established rights there.108.	If Israel truly advocates peace  I challenge its Foreign Minister to stand here before the representatives of the peoples and nations of the world and declare from this very rostrum Israel's willingness to withdraw completely from occupied Arab territories and to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State on the land it cultivated and on which it built its civilization for thousands of years.109.	It may be recalled that General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 on the partition of Palestine  provided for the establishment of two independent States in Palestine  an Arab State and a Jewish State  two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the Mandatory Power had been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948.110.	Thirty years have passed since adoption of that resolution  upon which Israel's leaders and philosophers based the  legitimacy  of their State and its continuation. How can one part of the resolution be implemented while the other is completely ignored?111.	Given the existence of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  how can Israel deny the right of a people to establish its own independent State just as other nations and peoples do? Year after year since 1947 the General Assembly has recognized the right of this people of its territory  to national identity and independence. Is it not entitled to demand the exercise of its right to self-determination  independence and repatriation? Who is Israel to deny the right of the Palestinian people to have their own State on Palestinian territory?112.	No matter how long Israel procrastinates and persists in oppression it will be unable to prevent the establishment in Palestine of an independent Palestinian State in which the Palestinian people can exercise their sovereignty without restriction and continue to make their great contribution to civilization  working for rapprochement between nations and serving as a link between civilizations  thus spreading tolerance and brotherhood among all.113.	Even more flagrant than this Israeli rejection of the right of the Palestinian people to establish their independent State is the insistence of the rulers of Israel on imposing their guardianship and their will on the Palestinians. Those rulers rejected a decision taken by the people to select their own representatives to speak on their behalf  protect their interests and express their aspirations. Such a situation is unprecedented in history because it means that Israel  following its occupation of the territory of the people of Palestine  now claims the right to control the minds and the collective conscience of the Palestinian people. Israel imagines that it can select those who should represent the Palestinians and defend their interests  and reject the freely chosen representatives to whom has been entrusted the task of leading the national struggle.114.	By this strange behaviour Israel is claiming for itself a right never claimed by any other country  however strong or dominant  now or in the past. If we were to use the same logic in dealing with Israel we could say that we did not recognize the Israeli Government as the representative of that people and we could insist on selecting other representatives. In fact  we would have more right to do that because the rulers of Israel who speak in its name today have a history dark enough to cast upon the entire society the stigma of having abandoned all human values and embraced theories which violate the most evident human rights. Thus we have more reason to object to their representation on the basis of their record of aggression and terrorism and their racist practices.115.	To whom is Israel objecting? Is it objecting to the Palestine Liberation Organization  whose National Council announced on 20 March 1977 that it would continue the political struggle to achieve the objectives of the Palestinian people and expressed its desire to participate in all conferences  forums and international efforts concerned with the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Zionist struggle for the national rights approved by this august Assembly since 1974? Is not the Palestine Liberation Organization the same Organization that stressed the importance of establishing relations with Jewish democratic and progressive forces within and outside the occupied territories?116.	With whom does Israel want to deal  assuming that we grant it permission to select its own opponents? Does it wish to deal with marginal elements which have no authority?117.	I should like to say this to Israel and its rulers. All this is going to serve no purpose  and will prove futile. You have failed in your attempt to ignore the fact that the Palestinian people exist  just as you have failed to conceal this fact from the world. Similarly  you will find yourselves completely unable to ignore the fact that there are legitimate and freely accepted representatives of the Palestinian people  who have reiterated this confidence in them every time they have had to select representatives and vote. The Arab nation has endorsed that choice and that vote at the highest level of leadership  and it was given unanimous support at the Arab summit conference held in Rabat from 26 to 29 October 1974. That Arab decision is final and it was reaffirmed by this Assembly when it adopted  at its twenty-ninth session  those historic resolutions inviting the Palestine Liberation Organization to participate in the deliberations of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine   supporting the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people and giving the Palestine Liberation Organization observer status.118.	Israel's aggression has not been confined to the territory of the Palestinian people. Israel is now trying to exacerbate the situation in southern Lebanon and to use that situation as a pretext for interfering in the affairs of that sister country  which has been suffering for so long as a result of foreign ambitions and interference. I should like to warn Israel from this rostrum that any exploitation of the situation in that area will have the gravest consequences for Israel  in addition to the great damage it may do to the search for peace.119.	When we call attention to the fact that any toleration of aggression and extremism can only produce an escalation of aggression  we do not speak idly or in a vacuum; we are not putting forward unproved theoretical assumptions but are talking about a contemporary situation with which we are living and from which we derive our concept of the events and developments which take place. Suffice it to mention here the Israeli measures to change the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied territories despite the  depressed will and unanimous decision of the General assembly. I need not go into the details and the extent of those measures because the members of the Assembly are only too familiar with them and have stated their position on them individually and collectively. However  I should like to point out briefly the significance of those measures and the serious results which may ensue if they are allowed to produce the effect for which they have been designed.120.	As the Assembly knows  those Israeli measures are three-pronged.121.	First  there is an attempt to give legality to the Israeli settlements established on the West Bank. The Israeli cabinet issued a decision on 26 July 1977 giving legality to three new settlements created on the West Bank-namely  Hal Odmim near Jericho  Ofra near Ramallah and Elon Souria on the road to Nablus.122.	Secondly  there are the measures to impose Israeli regulations on the Arab population in the territories occupied since 5 June 1967 under the guise of ensuring equality between the Arab population and citizens of Israel. This is  of course  only a flimsy pretext  because everybody is aware that Israel treats an Arab as a person who has no right to life  work or choice. This measure made clear Israel's true policy  which is based on annexation and territorial expansion. There could be no stronger proof of this than the statement of the official spokesman of the Israeli Government who responded to the criticism of the decision by saying: You cannot annex to Israel territory that belongs to the Israeli people  because this territory was originally theirs. You do not annex your own territory. What further proof of Israel expansionist intentions is needed?123.	Thirdly  there is the establishment of new Jewish settlements on the West Bank. On 17 August 1977 an official Israeli source declared that it had been decided to create three new settlements on the West Bank. This decision means that settlements established by Israel in the occupied territory since June 1967 now total 85  distributed as follows: 37 settlements on the West Bank; 25 settlements in the Golan Heights; 18 settlements in the Sinai peninsula; 5 settlements in the Gaza sector. Israel has not been deterred from persisting in this strange policy by the fact that this Assembly has condemned these Israeli measures on more than one occasion. This Assembly  which is the true representative of international unanimity  has declared those measures to be void and without legal validity either now or in the future. I should like to refer in particular to the resolution concerning the City of Jerusalem adopted in July 1967 and resolution 31/106 A adopted in 1976  in which the Assembly strongly deplored various Israeli policies and practices of this kind  especially the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and the transfer thereto of an alien population. The resolutions reaffirmed that all measures taken by Israel to change the physical character  demographic composition and institutional structure of the occupied territories were ill and void.124.	It is evident from those two resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and from the statement by th3 President of the Security Council on 11 November 1976s that the international community condemns considers that they have no legal validity and reaffirms that the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the occupied Arab territories.125.	The latest Israeli measures provide an opportunity for all countries without exception to declare their rejection of those measures and of the arguments adduced to defend them. I should like to refer in particular here to the firm statement made by President Omar Bongo  the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  and the official statements issued by the Governments of the Asian and European countries and the countries of North and South America  as well as to the statements of all my colleagues  the Foreign Ministers  who participated in the general debate.126.	The timing of the announcement of those new measures by the Prime Minister of Israel was indeed strange and calls for examination. Mr. Begin chose to announce them on his return from his visit to the United States  well aware of the publicity that they would receive  in order to portray himself  falsely  as a saint and a messenger of peace.127.	For all these considerations  Egypt has requested that this serious situation be examined  for the purpose of taking new collective action to deter Israel from these practices  which have been condemned by the world community. Therefore  on behalf of Egypt  I should like to submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution  the text of which will be distributed later today.128.	We  the Arabs  are seeking peace. We are seeking peace in the perspective of our historic role. We seek no aggression and we make no unfounded claims. We seek to ensure rapprochement between peoples and we realize that the real challenge facing us is the challenge of progress and prosperity  which basically is the challenge of overcoming the most basic economic problems. We are attempting to do this while preserving our national independence and our free will  bearing in mind the need to maintain the delicate balance between interdependence  on the one hand  and the preservation of the culture  heritage and values of the people  on the other.129.	We firmly believe that the Middle East area should remain an area of peace and coexistence in which everyone can enjoy his freedom  liberty  right to life and progress  free from fear and oppression.130.	We are also ready to assume our responsibility under the Charter to maintain world peace and to contribute to the welfare of the world  for we believe that the international community is one family where co-operation  understanding and coexistence should reign. God the Almighty has said in the Koran:  I have created you as one nation and made of you tribes clans so that you may get to know each other better.131.	It is against this spiritual and civilized background that President Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat presented his peace initiative on 16 October 1973-when Egypt and the Arab world had reached the height of their victory-for a just and durable peace in the area. It is against this background that the Arab nation has maintained its pledge to peace despite the adverse and negative reactions of the other party. This only serves to prove that that party cither is not ready or is unwilling to meet the challenge of peace.132.	The Assembly may also recall that Egypt opened the Suez Canal for international navigation on 5 June 1975  in order to facilitate and pave the road towards peace  despite the fact that Israel has attempted to impede the achievement of peace and to place obstacles in the path of all peace-seeking efforts.133.	Egypt is convinced that the achievement of peace is not only a duty  but a necessity. Peace is possible and attainable provided that Israel decides in the final analysis to accept the challenge of peace and all that it entails in terms of responsibility and the requirements of a constructive approach. The elements of peace are the following: first  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the Arab territories occupied since 5 June 1967; secondly  the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the territory of Palestine  the right to .return of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination; thirdly  the right of every State in the area to live in peace; fourthly  the provision of the necessary guarantees for all peoples of the area to live in security on their own land and to enjoy their own property. We do not object to any collective or bilateral guarantees  including any guarantees provided by the United States for Israel  on condition that they do not constitute a threat to Arab national security.134.	On the other hand  we are willing to examine all forms of guarantees  whether in the form of buffer zones  demilitarized zones  the establishment of United Nations forces  the reduction of forces or arms in areas adjacent to the borders  or even the use of modern early-warning systems for the detection of any developments that would endanger peace and security. The guarantees could also include political commitments provided by States Members of the United Nations.135.	Fifthly  in connection with the whole aspect of guarantees  I should like to stress that real peace cannot be ensured unless there is agreement on the following points.136.	The first point relates to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. We believe that a nuclear threat from any source will jeopardize the prospects of peace in the Middle East and would make peace only an empty word. How are we to feel safe with the knowledge that Israel  in co-operation and collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa  is determined to become a nuclear Power? This indeed is not a manifestation of the desire for peace but only indicates the continued aggressive intentions of Israel  based on the fallacy of military superiority.137.	I should like to declare solemnly from this rostrum that if Israel ever obtains nuclear weapons  no one could expect us to stand idly by in the face of that development  which would create a grave situation militarily  politically and morally. Thus  we insist in the context of a peace agreement that Israel should adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  for it is inconceivable that Israel should be the only State in the Middle East not acceding to that Treaty. Egypt  for its part  having already signed that Treaty  is willing to abide by it.138.	The second point is the necessity to regulate conventional armaments-in the event of a just and lasting peace—since a race in this field is likely to increase tension and thus increase the possibilities that the situation will explode in the future.139.	The third point is that under no circumstances can the present Israeli immigration policy be continued. We believe that the continuation of such a policy of open-door  unlimited immigration from all parts of the world could only trigger further aggression and expansion at the expense of the Arab countries.140.	Israel realizes the difficulties it is now encountering in attracting new immigrants and providing them with accommodations. Israel should draw the proper lessons from that. We maintain that  if Israel wishes to enjoy a normal status and to be accepted  it must refrain from instigating the citizens of other nations to leave their own countries of origin on the pretext that they are living in the Diaspora and outside the Promised Land. At the same time  Israel is denying the Palestinian people the right to return to their country of origin.141.	Sixthly  there is no alternative to the return of Arab Jerusalem to those who have a right to it territorially  historically and culturally.142.	The challenge facing us is obvious  with no uncertainty or ambiguity  and the choice for Israel is clear. The challenge is very clear arid obvious and the choice for Israel is evident  with no room for deception. Israel must either lean towards peace and choose to be a normal State in the region  in which case it must terminate its aggression against Arab rights and end its occupation of Arab territories  or it must confront a united Arab nation  which has the backing of a world that has discovered the false nature of Israel's claims and the danger which its intentions involve.143.	For our part  we shall continue to pursue the course of peace  but without the slightest neglect of our defensive capabilities  which provide the foundation for our pursuit of peace. It is with objectivity and impartiality that we express the belief that there is a golden opportunity for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the area and for putting an end to violence  war and destruction. If we miss this golden opportunity it may not present itself again at any time in the future.144.	We shall work persistently and continuously for the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  which shoulders the task and responsibility of representing the Palestinian people. We cannot imagine a solution to the problem in the absence of the Palestinian people  for their cause is the origin and core of the conflict. We would be deceiving ourselves if we thought for one moment that we could impose on that people the persons who should represent them. We would also be deceiving ourselves if we thought for a moment that we could deny them participation in the political efforts after having been accepted- for the first time in the history of the conflict-as part of this process and to be bound by its principles and rules.145.	We support any formula that would help the participation of representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the Geneva Conference on an equal footing with the rest of the parties. We disapprove of any formula that would lead to anything contrary to that  including the proposal for a unified Arab delegation which  in our view  is of no benefit unless the Palestine Liberation Organization participates with the other parties on the same level. In other words  that idea is rejected  if the purpose behind it is to get around that organization's established right to represent the Palestinian people.144- Egypt and the whole Arab nation are truly grateful to this Assembly and deeply appreciate the constructive support that we have received from its firm stand and concrete actions  which go beyond mere words and verbal support. Egypt undertakes and pledges to seek United Nations participation in every step and to refer to it whenever there is any development in the situation  since that is where the responsibility and the decision lie.145.	If Israel's rulers had any historical awareness  they would have realized that the first objective they should seek is free acceptance  based on choice and conviction on the part of the Arab nation amidst which they live.146.	The Arab nation is prepared to accept those who are prepared to be bound by the legitimacy and supremacy of law. At the same time it rejects those who place themselves above the law or who take the law into their hands  toy with it as they please and convert it into a law of the jungle whenever they find it convenient.147.	We accept coexistence  plurality and interaction between opinions  beliefs and cultures. That is the challenge.148.	We reject occupation  expansion  the acquisition of territory by force and the violation of rights.149.	We accept  for the first time  the call to create normal conditions under which the Palestinian people can give expression to their capabilities and talents. Therein lies the key to the situation  and to the drive towards peace.150.	We reject the claim that the Palestinian people are doomed to live in a new Diaspora in the twentieth century or in the darkness of the Middle Ages.151.	You have stood by us in our just struggle for peace and liberty  and we cherish that fact with all appreciation and gratitude.152.	Tomorrow the sun of freedom will shine  dissipating the darkness of colonialism and racism.  "
"42",2195,"ESP",32,1977,"﻿141.	 Mr. President  my first words will be words of welcome and of farewell. Welcome to you  Mr. President  whom I am honoured to congratulate on your election to the presidency. Your long and brilliant leadership of the delegation of Yugoslavia in the United Nations justifies our hope that you will accomplish an outstanding and brilliant task in guiding the work of this General Assembly.142.	May I also address words of farewell and cordial gratitude to Mr. Amerasinghe  the representative of Sri Lanka in this forum  under whose illustrious and skilful guidance the work of the last session of the General Assembly and of the Conference on the Law of the Sea progressed so satisfactorily.143.	We have among us two new Members-Viet Nam and Djibouti. We warmly welcome and congratulate them  and express the desire of the Government of Spain to establish relations of friendship and co-operation in all spheres with them.144.	It is for me a particularly pleasant duty to reiterate our tribute of admiration and gratitude to our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who brilliantly executed his duties during his first term of office  and it is for Spain a certain guarantee of the accomplishment of the important tasks that this Organization must face that Mr. Waldheim was re-elected to a post of such lofty responsibility for a new term of office  during which we are sure that he will flourish and achieve much  as is guaranteed by his competence  prudence and impartiality.145.	Since the general elections held in my country on 15 June for Spain a new era of international dimensions has opened up.146.	The Government  in defining its foreign policy  has had very much in mind the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations  this Organization which is dedicated to the maintenance of international peace and security and to promoting co-operation and friendly relations among all countries within a framework of justice and freedom.147.	In this context  together with our active participation in the Western and European world  what is particularly important is the realistic and fruitful reaffirmation of the close links my country maintains with Iberia-American nations and those in the Mediterranean area. All of this is part of the pursuit of universal objectives defined in three kinds of action: the promotion of detente and disarmament  the defence of human rights and the establishment of a fair and equitable international economic order.148.	The state of international relations is hardly a cause for optimism. But we would be making a serious mistake in our assessment of the potentialities of this Organization were we merely to adjust our words and deeds to a passive recognition that nothing can be done. It would be unfair to consider that the present situation does not already represent considerable progress compared with previous situations through which we lived and suffered.149.	From this point of view  the action of the United Nations  which is still imperfect and still subject to the pressures of the great Powers  to the fears of the small Powers and the selfishness of all  is considerable. As far as Spain is concerned  and having mentioned the important inspiration of the Organization in our actions  I should like to refer particularly to the moments when  in the course of the past year  co-operation between my country and the United Nations was particularly clear.150.	On 28 September 1976  I had the honour of signing  in the presence of the Secretary-General and on behalf of the Government of Spain  the United Nations Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. On 27 April of this year  on the occasion of his visit to the United Nations  the President of the Government of Spain delivered to the Secretary-General the instruments of ratification of these Covenants. This represented an important step in my country's relations with the United Nations  in a direction which Mr. Adolfo Suarez described when he expressed  the importance the Government of the Monarchy attaches to respect for and application of inalienable and irrevocable rights  and reaffirmed: . . my -country's determination to expand international action to the utmost so that these human rights  of which this Organization is so rightly the spokesman and catalyst  will increasingly become a fundamental principle in relations among nations. In the same context  we must include Spain's accession to 1LO Conventions 87 and 98  which guarantee freedom of trade unions.151.	Proper respect for and due protection of human rights constitute  and will continue to constitute  basic principles of my country's law and policy.152.	Action undertaken by my Government  together with this Organization  to safeguard human rights must be viewed as the expression of a political will. From that standpoint  I should like to state that any initiative conducive to improving respect for human rights throughout the world will always find firm support in Spain.153.	Various circumstances have contributed to making the year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly one that can be described as the year of human rights. This was not the result of organized action or of a joint international initiative. Various forces which play a decisive role in the world scene today have helped to bring human rights continuously  and often polemically  to the forefront of international relations during the past 12 months.154.	These polemics are in turn included in the most general scope of what constitutes the essence of detente. For some    detente would be meaningless outside the framework of a process for the progressive affirmation of human freedom. For others  the emphasis placed on it and the corresponding description of interference in internal affairs would seriously endanger other sectors of global negotiations involved in detente.155.	For our part  I should like to state our deep conviction that human rights cannot be parcelled out. Full respect for them must emerge from the joint affirmation of the values of freedom and justice. We believe that justice will develop best in an atmosphere of freedom.156.	The fact is that today  and in what we feel is a positive way  the idea is gaining ground that human rights must be a basic factor in international relations. Violation of human rights  as has been demonstrated in many cases  is a factor of instability and insecurity in international life and  consequently  the decision as to the desirability or otherwise of implementing those rights is not a matter for individual States alone.157.	Consequently  Spain will tirelessly and continuously strive to ensure that the human person and his rights command primary attention and respect in every corner of the world  North and South  East and West. But Spain will also seek to ensure that this issue is understood in all its complexity. It is a matter of safeguarding freedom  but also of doing away with the dialectics of economic and political domination which  while preventing the normal development of men and nations  also make difficult the establishment and maintenance of material conditions in which freedom can be asserted and developed.158.	Year after year  in the general debates of this Assembly  we observe with concern that the same focal- points of conflict exist and that the same tensions remain unresolved.159.	In the first place  the situation in the Middle East continues to be a danger to the peace and security of the entire world  and particularly threatens the stability of a region  the Mediterranean  of which my country is a coastal State. For this reason and because Spain has always defended the just causes of the Arab Nation  my country had hoped that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East could have met this year.160.	Those hopes seem to have been shared by our Assembly which last year adopted resolution 31/62 calling for the early convening of that Conference. But the facts were otherwise  since the Conference cannot be held unless the parties concerned in the conflict are prepared to comply with the United Nations resolutions and particularly the resolutions adopted by the Security Council.161.	We continue to consider as unalterable the premises for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East to be respect for the right of existence of all countries in the area  within secure and recognized borders; the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied since the war of 1967; and recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.162.	In this connection  the Government of Spain is concerned about the continuation of certain practices which affect the territories that have been occupied since 1967  and particularly the establishment of Israeli settlements in those Arab territories  all of which constitutes a serious barrier to a just and peaceful solution.163.	The maintenance of normal and friendly relations with all countries of the world is a principle of our international relations. A start towards a solution to the Middle East would enable us to give effect to this desire and contemplate a future of normal relations with all the countries in the area.164.	The situation in southern Africa also seriously endangers peace and security and constitutes an open defiance of the entire international community. The apartheid system  the persistence of the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia and the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa are three aspects of the same reality of oppression and injustice which has prevailed for such a long time in that part of the world  and where the situation is progressively deteriorating.165.	The Government of Spain joins the international community in condemning every aspect of the policy of apartheid  including the establishment of the so-called  bantustans .166.	The Government of Spain is following with keen interest and supports efforts intended to attain the prompt and peaceful independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia with majority Governments.167.	Another critical area of tension on the African continent is that in the Maghreb regarding the decolonization of Western Sahara. Under circumstances known to all  Spain put an end once and for all to its presence and to its responsibilities in the Territory on 26 February 1976  specifying its position in the communication addressed by the Permanent Representative of my country to the Secretary-General on that same date. Nevertheless  we are following with grave concern the development of events in that region.168.	Spain trusts that formulas may be found which will facilitate the elimination of tension in the zone and will lead to stability and peaceful understanding in Maghreb within the framework of a just and lasting solution of the problem of Western Sahara. Spain considers that such a solution should be sought in agreement with the parties  by harmonizing their respective and legitimate interests and taking into account the expression of the will of the people of the Sahara.169.	May I recall  that in its resolution 3458 B (XXX)  which took note of the Declaration of Madrid of 14 November 1975 the General Assembly reaffirms ... the inalienable right to self-determination  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of all the Saharan populations originating in the Territory .Likewise  General Assembly resolution 31/45 adopted on 1 December 1976  in reaffirming this principle  called on OAU to seek a solution to the problem.170.	We are aware of the risks involved in the present situation in the region. Spain  motivated by the peaceful aims which are at the root of our foreign policy  and in a desire for friendship  good neighborliness and co-operation with all the countries of the area  makes an appeal for concord and dialogue between the parties which my country would be prepared to promote in so far as it is possible for us to do so.171.	In the same spirit it is the intention of my Government to co-operate in any humanitarian efforts of an international character that may be undertaken and for our part we shall take every step possible that may contribute to detente in that particularly sensitive area.172.	The question of Cyprus must be included also in the catalogue of situations of unresolved tensions. We do not wish to nor could we dictate solutions which must come from the freely expressed will of the population of the island. But the interests of the international community lie in promoting understanding and freedom without the participation of elements alien to that population and always for the sake of maintaining the sovereignty  integrity and independence of a State Member of this Organization.173.	A fundamental concern of the international community must be to consider the conflicts and their basic causes and to direct our efforts at pacification precisely to eliminating the causes of conflicts. We view with the utmost concern the particularly grave effects which the arms race has on the maintenance  and the spread of centres of conflict. Political and economic interests intervene and nourish conflicts which  while no solution of their basic causes is found  grow progressively more serious as a result of the indiscriminate use of increasingly sophisticated and deadly weapons. Thus there is a vicious circle of actions and reactions  the final effects of which cannot be foreseen.174.	Security and disarmament must be combined and must gradually replace the increasingly unrealistic notion that security to be such must be armed. This idea will always lead to a search for absolute levels of security which in turn will always mean absolute degrees of insecurity  thus creating an endless arms race seeking an unattainable parity. These observations are true for both nuclear and conventional weapons. Perhaps it is superfluous to insist  once again  on the gigantic deviation of productive resources required for the arms race. We need unarmed security because then the possibilities of war or confrontation are of necessity reduced  but we urgently need also to see to it that disarmament leads to fruitful and firm solutions. That would enable mankind to reach worthy levels of development in an acceptable framework of security.175.	On the basis of these considerations  Spain always looks favourably on every effort made bilaterally or multilaterally  within the United Nations or outside  which are carried out to halt the arms race. My country will always pay particular attention to any negotiating forum which seeks this objective  whether with regard to the limitation of strategic forces  the reduction of forces in central Europe  the possible discussion of similar measures for other geographical areas or  particularly  the convening of a world disarmament conference. Our final objective is and continues to be gradually to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control. We should like every aspect of disarmament to be considered in a global framework which would exclude all propaganda but would at the same time be realistic and cover all the causes of possible conflicts in all their complexity and ultimately the fundamental elements of security.176.	Spain considers that the initiative taken with regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is a constructive one  but we would prefer that the concept of horizontal proliferation should no longer be used in a discriminatory manner and at the same time should be matched with tangible results in regard to the concept of vertical non-proliferation.177.	My Government awaits with confidence the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  in the Preparatory Committee for which Spain has been participating very actively. Along this same line of thinking I should like to express the interest we feel in establishing and maintaining denuclearized zones such as the one in the Indian Ocean. In this concept there is the chance of a gradual regional approach to general and complete disarmament and a real possibility of the concept's spreading through clearly defined regional zones.178.	There are today examples of the regionalization of security  as it is encouraged by this Organization  that are worth taking into account and  if possible  imitating. I should like to refer particularly to the results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which will resume its work in Belgrade during the first days of October this year. The Conference  whose sessions were held at Helsinki and Geneva and will now be held at Belgrade  gives us a good indication of the possibilities and limitations of regional agreements on security items. The Conference  because of its composition and mechanisms  is a forum for equal non-discriminatory participation by large  medium and small-sized countries and the results already obtained doubtless assume a reasonable basis of security for all the countries participating in it. This basis was clearly made possible by a balanced and realistic consideration of the factors which fundamentally constitute security. Spain  which has always expressed its profound belief in the virtues of the Conference  will continue to participate in it actively  with hope and with realism.179.	In this context I should particularly like to refer to all of the aspects encompassed by the security of the Mediterranean. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in this respect represents a fir and very promising attempt which we trust will be continued and expanded in this and at future sessions of the Conference  as well as by means of the corresponding bilateral and multilateral contacts. We could not. conceive of a solidly cemented European security unless  at the same time  security in the Mediterranean were part of it.180.	This Organization still has to consider colonial situations which have not been resolved and to which Spain attaches particular importance  I refer to the cases of the Malvinas Islands  Belize and Gibraltar.181.	The negotiations now being conducted between Argentina and the United Kingdom on the Malvinas Islands may be described as moderately encouraging. In these negotiations a sincere will to consider all questions and interests at stake has been demonstrated  without the minimum requirements of each of the parties constituting a barrier to a promising spirit of conciliation and understanding. We hope that the dispute over Belize will similarly come to a successful conclusion through a justly negotiated and peaceful settlement.182.	As for Gibraltar  the United Nations has repeatedly defined its doctrine  urging the opening of negotiations to put an end to the colonial status of the Rock. My country has made constant efforts to start these negotiations  and we continue to hope that the United Kingdom will demonstrate the will to negotiate which this Organization has so insistently called upon it to show. For my part  1 should like once again to reaffirm Spain's inalienable claim to sovereignty over that territory. At the last plenary session of Spain's Congress of Deputies devoted to a debate on foreign policy  all the Spanish political factions expressed themselves in favour of the reintegration of Gibraltar with Spain.183.	Let it be clear that we are prepared to co-operate with the United Kingdom on the question of Gibraltar in its entirety  taking  into account the interests of its inhabitants and facilitating the integration of the Rock with the surrounding area  as the progress of negotiations allows.184.	Finally  within the framework of regional agreements  Spain is pleased that the treaties concluded between the United States and Panama have been signed  paving the way for a satisfactory solution of the question of the Panama Canal.185.	The international configuration of the world today has been shaped on a bipolar pattern  which  imposing itself on other ideological confrontations  divides the world into two compartments: the industrially developed countries on the one hand and the less developed countries on the other. The world economic crisis which broke out at the end of 1973 contributed to the diversification of that bipolar situation into new and complex realities. Mankind's major challenge is its ability to provide a world-wide solution to the economic problems which afflict it. A strengthening of the framework of interdependence and solidarity among nations  going beyond any desire for domination  and acknowledging the difficulty of economic independence  is therefore a pressing question. That great adventure  perhaps the greatest of our time  is called co-operation which  as the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs has said  deserves continuous  constant and creative effort.186.	The international community  acting through various agencies and particularly through the United Nations is clearly aware of the urgency and gravity of the matter and of its pressing needs.187.	International co-operation has been the subject of meetings in various occasions  particularly at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly. We shall soon take up the task of defining the objectives for the third United Nations development decade.188.	Yet the data available to us  which have been compiled in the Secretary-General's reports  show that a disquieting situation remains  the essential feature of which is the fact that the difference in the income levels of the developed and the less-developed world has continued and has even grown. This picture is profoundly unsatisfactory and calls for continuous action by States  by international institutions and by this very General Assembly of the United Nations  in seeking a more rational conservation and distribution of available resources  thus facilitating the achievement of proper levels of subsistence and well being for the people of the whole world.189.	We must at the same time work harder individually and collectively to change the world economic structure and move towards the establishment of a new international economic order. To do this  we must first ensure fluidity and flexibility in international trade and finance. Any measure likely to prevent the establishment of international barriers must be supported by the international agencies. Secondly  we must seek to stabilize the terms of trade in raw materials and finished products  and to ensure that adequate and safe markets will enable the developing countries to stabilize their balance of payments and thus be in a position to plan their economic development on a longer-term basis.190.	As regards raw materials  in seeking adequate regulation of commodity markets  greater co-operation in the over-all use of energy resources-the very essence of development-must be secured. In this respect  my Government is convinced of the value of the proposal by the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  concerning the establishment of an international energy institute within the United Nations  and we shall duly support the study and the development of this concept when necessary.191.	In fact  the problem of energy resources is one with which my country is particularly concerned  having suffered intensely from the effects of the crisis. It is well aware of the difficulties and efforts involved in raising and maintaining its national product and its standard of living. That does not prevent us from participating actively and with interest in the international action devoted to that great undertaking which is world co-operation.192.	We have participated in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation among the industrialized countries  between which there are marked differences in economic potential. At that Conference  Spain supported further negotiations to establish a permanent fund for commodities and announced its contribution to the special fund to assist the countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis. I should like to emphasize that  although the results of the North-South Conference were limited  that Conference took a realistic approach to the world's economic problems and in any case it defined the dynamics of a dialogue  which we consider to be positive.193.	But the Paris dialogue showed its limitations  confirmed by the fact that towards the end of its last session the General Assembly was unable to evaluate the results of the Conference. The dialogue must go on now in every forum and particularly in the United Nations.194.	Spain has also joined the International Fund for Agricultural Development and will make a contribution to it.195.	Spain has recently become a member of the Governing Council of UNDP  and we intend actively to participate in technical co-operation with the countries and areas which need it. We give priority to items requiring Mediterranean co-operation and in this context we have co-operated very  actively in UNEP. We note with satisfaction the efforts of the international community to promote new forms of co-operation  so adequately reflected in the series of conferences recently convened by the United Nations  on specific items such as population  food  industrialization and the conference held this year on water and on desertification. Above and beyond the major ideological systems or political divergences mankind faces profound problems which directly affect its survival. It is a question of a more equitable structure for the over-all distribution of resources and of the available wealth. It is a question of making our universe habitable  clean and orderly in terms of human needs and the free development of every human being. We must attack and prevent pollution and have air and water which will make human life less difficult. Ultimately we must collectively participate in designing a world in which human abilities can freely develop and where needs will be adequately met. This gigantic and urgent task requires a combination of political  economic  technical and legal efforts.196.	The United Nations devotes a major part of its endeavours to these needs  and I should like to refer in particular to the progress attained at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.197.	The spirit of the Conference and its desire to attain a new and balanced maritime order taking into account the legitimate interests of all countries and of the international community as a whole must lead to satisfactory solutions. It is not for nothing that its aim is extremely ambitious and was conceived to be universal. The major question of the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  conceived as being irrevocably the common heritage of mankind  constitutes a test for that ever more intense international co-operation we seek. In this the great industrialized countries  the lesser industrialized countries and the developing countries must find harmonious formulas which will contribute to a new world economic order.198.	Among the most important questions under discussion  I should like to refer particularly to a problem that is vital to my country that of access to the living resources of the exclusive economic zone of other States for men accustomed to fish there in accordance with rights established by history or by custom. Spain has actively participated in the Conference seeking  as it will continue to do  to maintain a formula which will adequately safeguard the rights of all States and the interests of the international community as a whole.199.	Lastly  I wish to mention the importance which my country attaches to the negotiating and peace-keeping role of the United Nations in the international community and the need for all States Members to work for the institutional improvement of the Organization by way of Charter reform.200.	Among other measures  we consider of particular interest the strengthening of the Security Council  the establishment of a permanent system of peace observation and the possibility of establishing a permanent world economic commission within the framework of the Economic and Social Council.201.	My country  has this year participated actively in the important tasks of the special committee to review the Charter of the United Nations. It attaches great importance to the work of that Committee and hopes that among its proposals will be found a course of action to make the work of this Organization more flexible and its effectiveness greater.202.	Spain will always seek to serve the lofty purposes of this Organization and the Assembly can be sure that we shall never fail to co-operate with it to ensure that the international community  of which this Assembly is the most genuine representation  may make progress and achieve results along the path of peace  understanding and co-operation.203.	We live under the aegis of solidarity. We live united. Let us act united.  "
"43",2267,"ETH",32,1977,"﻿99.	Mr. President  on behalf of my Government and myself  I would like to extend to you warm congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your wide experience  your re- known judgement your well-known qualities as a diplomat and your dedication to the ideals of the United Nations augur well for the success of this session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is also a recognition by the international community of the constructive role which the Government and people of Yugoslavia  under the illustrious leadership of President Josip Broz Tito  are playing in world affairs. The warm fraternal relations that exist between Ethiopia and Yugoslavia  both of which have a common heritage of bitter struggle against fascism and identical aspirations to promote the ideals of the non-aligned movement  are an additional source of satisfaction to my delegation.100.	I wish also to place on record our appreciation of the accomplishments of your distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Amerasinghe  who presided over the last session of the General Assembly with a high standard of leadership and objectivity.101.	It is also my privilege to express my Government's sincere and profound joy in welcoming the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations.102.	The admission of the Republic of Djibouti to the United Nations family gives us particularly great satisfaction. The Government and people of Ethiopia pledge their whole-hearted support and co-operation to the brotherly people and Government of the Republic of Djibouti in their task of nation-building and the preservation of their hard-won independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. My Government strongly believes that Djibouti's vigilance in safeguarding its independence and territorial integrity will positively contribute towards the maintenance of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa.103.	The international community has every reason to rejoice at seeing the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at long last gain its rightful place in this Organization. The membership in the United Nations of the gallant people of Viet Nam  whose determination  steadfastness  perseverance and immense sacrifices determined the outcome of the bitter struggle for freedom and independence  is well deserved. It is therefore with a deep sense of emotion that I extend my warm congratulations to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on its admission to membership in the United Nations.104.	The Ethiopian delegation drew the attention of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly to what it then regarded as disquieting developments in the world. We indicated that time was running out for the United Nations  precisely at a period when time was of the essence for the speedy solution of a number of complex problems confronting mankind. We also suggested that an impasse was being reached because of the tendency to use the United Nations as a platform for sterile confrontation rather than a medium for innovative co-operation. The present situation hardly justifies a better assessment.105.	In our view  the world body is still increasingly gripped by a sense of helplessness leading to a high degree of cynicism. On the one hand  resolutions come pouring out of every session of our Assembly; high principles are enunciated from this podium and the Charter is quoted time and again-seemingly with great reverence. But  on the other hand  habitual violators of those same resolutions and principles of the Charter go unpunished  and new violators emerge in the knowledge that the United Nations can do nothing to them. As long as that cynical tendency continues  the world body will remain immobilized and mankind will be the poorer for it.106.	One of the violators of the Charter—and  indeed  the most persistent of them all-is the South African Government. Built as it is on the odious system of apartheid  that regime has been allowed to violate every principle of the Charter and  thanks to its imperialist backers  has succeeded in getting away with it. Over the years  the South African Government has perfected its abhorrent racial system of apartheid and single-mindedly used it for oppressing the African majority in that country as well as in Namibia. The repeated calls of the international community to the apartheid regime to crimes against the African people have for a long gone unheeded. People .have been massacred  resources plundered  and aggression against neighbouring States committed; and yet the United Nations has not succeeded even in persuading South Africa's friends to stop their economic  military and diplomatic support of that racist regime.Such utter helplessness on the part of the United Nations has only emboldened the apartheid regime in its barbarous acts of systematic extermination of African nationalists. The recent cold-blooded murder of Steven Biko in a racist prison is still fresh in our minds. Even through death  he and the other martyrs have advanced further the just cause of their oppressed compatriots.109.	In Namibia  South Africa has continued its illegal occupation despite the definitive ruling of the International Court of Justice terminating South Africa's fictitious right to administer the Territory. In that case also  with the help of its imperialist supporters  South Africa has managed to defy world public opinion by utilizing manoeuvres ranging from outright arrogance to sham reasonableness. After the apartheid regime's diabolical plot to establish an interim puppet government through the so-called Turnhalle Conference was totally rejected by the people of Namibia as well as by the international community  that regime has now embarked again with the close collaboration of its friends  on yet another scheme  purportedly to achieve a peaceful resolution of the problem. But I should like to make it clear that  whatever deals are being worked out  they will not be acceptable to Africa unless they conform to the guidelines set out in the recent resolution of the OAU adopted at Libreville  Gabon. Furthermore  we consider the full participation of SWAPO  the authentic representative of the people of Namibia  at all stages of the negotiations for any arrangement as absolutely necessary. Similarly  any arrangement which will be arrived at must be acceptable to SWAPO.110.	On Zimbabwe  our position is just as firm. The racist regime of Ian Smith has lasted for far too long. Its continued existence is not only an affront to the basic rights and dignity of the people of Zimbabwe but is also a serious threat to peace and security in the region. The international community should not therefore be satisfied with mere condemnation of the racist regime's repeated acts of aggression against neighbouring African States. Rather  the world body  especially the Security Council  must ensure that aggression is punished. While welcoming proposals for establishing majority rule  provided all aspects of those proposals conform with the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe  Ethiopia reaffirms its total support for and solidarity with the liberation movements in Zimbabwe.111.	In our deliberations on the colonial and racial questions of southern Africa  we believe that we should be guided by the principles enunciated in the Maputo Declaration in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  and the Programme of Action for the Liberation of Zimbabwe and Namibia  both of which were adopted by the Maputo Conference in the spring of 1977  as well as those enunciated by the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos last August.112.	Moreover  in the face of the continuing obduracy of the racist regime in South Africa and Zimbabwe  Ethiopia firmly believes it is high time that the Security Council should  at long last  rise to the challenge and enforce comprehensive mandatory sanctions against those two international outlaws.113.	My delegation also notes with regret that no tangible progress has yet been made to resolve the Middle East problem. The situation in the area thus remains as explosive as ever. The ingredients necessary for any durable peace in the region-including Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories  the rights of the Palestinian people to a homeland and  concurrently  the right of every State in the area to independent existence-are already recognized in the relevant United Nations decisions. My delegation therefore ardently hopes that  with a view to a speedy implementation of those decisions  the current efforts to reconvene the Geneva negotiations on the Middle East will produce positive results.114.	Ethiopia's firm position with regard to scrupulous respect for the unity and territorial integrity of non-aligned Cyprus remains unchanged.115.	In the area of disarmament  it is regrettable to note that significant progress has not been achieved over the last year. The most recent worth-while achievements in the field of arms control have been those of a decade ago. Since the l%0s progress has been painfully slow  while expenditure on armaments has been increasing enormously. Resources that could be used for development are still being diverted to the production and stockpiling of ever more destructive weapons. N1 delegation ardently hopes that the forthcoming spec session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament will focus on these and related problems and generate a new and effective impetus towards genuine disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  since nuclear arms at present pose the most serious danger for the future of mankind.116.	In the economic sphere  the relations of the developing countries with the industrialized countries are still suffering the consequences of the existing unjust and inequitable world economic order. At a time when exploitation has to give way to co-operation and when domination has to be replaced by interdependence  it is regrettable to see that the industrialized countries are still upholding past practices in the interests of preserving their privileged status. We believe that it would be to their long-term advantage to remedy the injustices of the past and face the realities of today  for a world divided between conspicuous wealth and abject poverty cannot provide an atmosphere conducive to peaceful coexistence.117.	Unfortunately  the industrialized countries are still not prepared to engage in a serious effort at eliminating global injustice and inequality. For almost three decades developing countries have been demanding a fundamental revision of international economic relations. It is regrettable to note  however  that developed countries are rather unwilling to respond to that justified demand by committing themselves to solving the pressing problems of the developing countries. This is clearly demonstrated by the lack of concrete results in the negotiations conducted both within the United Nations and in other forums.118.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation or the so-called North-South dialogue  which was held in Paris  did not produce any tangible result after 18 months of protracted negotiations. Similarly  the fourth session of UNCTAD adjourned without much success  thus further frustrating the expectations and aspirations of the developing countries.119.	Evidently  the present world economic order is incapable of redressing the inequality and injustice that characterize the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have- nots"". Hence  a thorough restructuring of the words economic order is an imperative of our times. The new international economic order  which must be based on the principle of shared prosperity  justice and common benefits  should recognize the fact that the problem of development is the joint responsibility of the industrialized and the developing countries.120.	In the field of trade  developing countries must be assured of their due share of benefits through free access for their commodities to the markets of the industrialized countries. The prices paid for their products must be equitable and remunerative. The new order should also provide some mechanism for alleviating the crushing burden of debt-servicing. In short  it must enable the third world to maintain self-sustained development. Similarly  to the extent that collective self-reliance through co-operation is one way of promoting socio-economic transformations  developing countries should reorient their efforts towards strengthening co-operation among themselves.121.	My delegation is no less convinced that the solution of the crucial economic and social problems facing the international community today will have a most salutary effect on universal respect for the fundamental rights of all peoples. We believe that while the masses  the most preponderant majority inhabiting the planet earth live in squalid misery and abject poverty  the international community can hardly be satisfied in promoting only the marginal aspects of the rights of that majority.122.	It is within this broader context that Ethiopia views the need for universal respect for basic human ""rights. We are deeply concerned about human rights precisely because one of the strongest driving forces which brought about the Ethiopian popular revolution of 1974 was undoubtedly the deplorable state of human rights which prevailed in Ethiopia under the feudal regime. By concealing from the Ethiopian people and the world at large the fact that  in two of our administrative regions alone  more than 200 000 Ethiopians were dying of famine  that oppressive regime  in its pursuit of vainglory  deprived my compatriots of even the right to life itself.123.	One of the greatest achievements of the Ethiopian revolution was  therefore  to emancipate the Ethiopian masses from the degrading servitude  methodical oppression and exploitation under which they had languished for so long. The demolition of the feudal structure in Ethiopia liberated millions of serfs  tenant farmers and workers from the servitude to which they had been subjected by restoring ownership of all lands and all major means of production and distribution  as well as the principal financial institutions  to the Ethiopian people. Similarly  such progressive measures as the new labour legislation and the proclamations establishing peasants' and urban dwellers' co-operative associations have created conditions whereby  for the first time  the Ethiopian people as a whole can enjoy fundamental liberties and be assured of the protection and development of their rights as free men. By establishing the Provisional Office for Mass Organization  the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia is also advancing the Ethiopian people towards the full exercise of their democratic rights.124.	Thus the new social and economic structure we are building in Ethiopia is directed not only at ensuring marginal aspects of fundamental liberties but  to an even larger measure  the economic and social rights of Ethiopians as a whole  without any distinction whatsoever. The content  direction and objective of the progressive changes which are taking place in Ethiopia  as well as our continued commitment to a non-aligned foreign policy  are clearly spelled out in our Programme of National Democratic Revolution  which has the full support of the Ethiopian people.125.	Over and above the reaction that such far-reaching changes inevitably generated on the part of vested interest groups of the old order  there was that of some external forces  averse to progressive change  which also chose to react negatively to our popular revolution. At the very moment when Ethiopia was making a maximum effort to rid itself of the sordid legacy of feudalism and to build a new political  social and economic order on solid foundations of equality and justice  thereby ensuring fundamental human rights for all Ethiopians  certain outside forces apparently thought that  by their concerted effort  they could reverse that historic current of change. Not content with frantic and hostile activities directed against the Ethiopian revolution  one of these forces is now engaged in naked aggression against Ethiopia  its unity and territorial integrity.126.	Over a period of nearly two years  the Government of Somalia has been infiltrating its regular troops into Ethiopia  for the deliberate purpose of committing an aggression short of a full-scale conventional war. These troops  which were heavily armed with sophisticated weapons such as missiles and anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons  had carried out systematic and extensive terror and sabotage in eastern and south-eastern Ethiopia. These infiltrators  while inflicting considerable loss of life  have also wrought immense havoc on the economy of the area by destroying villages  towns and major communication facilities  including the only railway line in the region  as well as agricultural settlements and other development projects established by our own efforts and through international assistance. The Government of Somalia will have to bear full responsibility in this respect.127.	Realizing that the troops thus infiltrated had failed to achieve its expansionist objectives  the Government ofSomalia embarked upon> a full-scale and open war of aggression on Ethiopia on 23 July 1977  using tanks and combat aircraft. As a result of this  a savage war is now raging between the invading Somalia forces and the defending Ethiopian troops inside Ethiopian territory.128.	Despite the preposterous claims of the Somali Government that the present war of aggression is actually being waged by a so-called ""liberation front""  the whole world now recognizes that this ingenious fabrication is quite ridiculous. Somalia's persistent denial of involvement in the undeclared war it has itself initiated and is relentlessly prosecuting is obviously motivated by a desire to conceal the extent of its atrocities. This in itself  far from diminishing its accountability  would only compound the crimes it is committing against the Ethiopian people and the peace and tranquillity of the region.129.	By its present aggression  Somalia not only has violated the cardinal principles of the Charters of both the OAU and the United Nations  but has also trampled underfoot a more recent decision of the General Assembly adopted at its twenty-fifth session. A brief quotation will suffice to amplify my point. In paragraph 5 of its resolution 2734 (XXV)  on the strengthening of international security  the General Assembly solemnly reaffirmed  among other matters:""... that every State has the duty to refrain from the threat of use of force against the territorial and political independence of any other State  and that the territory of a State shall not be the object of military occupation resulting from the use of force in contravention of the provisions of the Charter ... and that every State has the duty to refrain from organizing  instigating  assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State.""130.	It is common knowledge that the root cause of the present aggression is none other than the expansionist ambition of successive regimes in Somalia. Over the years  successive Governments and leaders of Somalia have publicly reiterated this ambition  which is enshrined in the Somali Constitution and on the Somali national flag in the form of a five-pointed star. While the two points on the Somali flag represent the former British and Italian colonies  the rest are supposed to symbolize eastern Ethiopia  the Republic of Djibouti and the northern region of Kenya. One may very well wonder about the grounds on which this lust for other people's land could be based. Essentially  it is based on the untenable and absurd assumption that any land on which ethnic Somalis live must be part and parcel of the Republic of Somalia and that therefore the Government in Mogadishu does not recognize international treaties  United Nations resolutions and or OAU decisions pertaining to inviolability of state frontiers.131.	In this context  it is relevant to recall certain basic facts. The history of the Horn of Africa  especially of the last 400 years  has been a history of successive ""waves"" of migrations from the lowlands to the more fertile highlands  new groups displacing earlier ones. In these successive migrations  the Somali tribes are late arrivals in the region. In their migrations to and expansions in the Horn  they displaced the original inhabitants of the region  who live today in Ethiopia and in the rest of East Africa. Indeed  at the beginning of their appearance on the scene  the Somalis were largely restricted to the northern part of present-day Somalia. In time  however  they pushed in different directions  particularly to the south  and took over the Benadir Coast. Because of ecological conditions of the country  this expansion to the south and in other directions has taken place over a long period and  even now  is apparently a continuing trend.132.	The population of Somalia  being largely nomadic  has never in history known the confines and restrictions of national frontiers. The only boundary known to them has been the furthest limit to available pasture. It is on the basis of this nomadic habit that the Government in Mogadishu lays its claims to the territories of its neighbours and pursues their realization through armed aggression.133.	If Somalia's attempt to annex eastern Ethiopia is based on the assumption that there is a Somali minority within Ethiopia  then such a reasoning  apart from being a calculated misrepresentation of the polytechnic nature of the Ethiopian polity  is apt to create a dangerous precedent exposing Africa  and perhaps even the rest of the world  to the forces of violence and instability.134.	The fact remains that there is not a single African country which does not have distinct ethnic groups straddling its borders. For example  the Bakongo are to be found in Zaire  Congo and Angola; the Ewe are divided between Ghana and Togo; the Yoruba between Nigeria and Benin; the Ben Amir between Ethiopia and the Sudan; the Masai between Kenya and Tanzania; the Hutu between Burundi and Rwanda; and so on. Similar examples can also be extensively cited outside the African continent. Therefore  if one were to be swayed by the irrational argument of the Mogadishu authorities  it means that the map of the entire world would have to be redrawn on the basis of ethnicity.135.	As if its racist claim to other countries' land  which is no different from Hitler's Anschluss  were not enough  the Somali Government has based its foreign policy on systematic denunciation of international agreements and decisions. Thus  over the years  Somalia has consistently rejected the series of treaties that have defined its borders  the Trusteeship Agreement that clearly endorsed the relevant treaties delimiting the boundaries of Italian Somaliland  and resolutions of OAU and the non-aligned countries in respect of boundaries  as well as the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the draft articles on succession of States in respect of treaties.136.	By rejecting the international boundary agreements signed prior to its independence on the ground that it had not participated in their formulation Somalia has in effect denounced the Trusteeship Agreement  which is clearly based on those same boundary agreements. The boundary agreements  together with the Trusteeship Agreement  are the only basis for its subsequent emergence as an independent State. Clearly Somalia could not be a party to the boundary agreements for the simple reason that it did not exist as a State prior to 1960. Notwithstanding Somalia's position the fact remains that the United Nations recognized the international agreements when drawing up the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration. In the words of Article 1 of the Agreement:""The territory to which this Agreement applies is the territory formerly known as Italian Somaliland  hereafter called the Territory  bounded by the Somaliland Protectorate  Ethiopia  Kenya  the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Its boundaries shall be those fixed by international agreement""—I repeat  ""Its boundaries shall be those fixed by international agreement""—""and  in so far as they are not already delimited  shall be delimited in accordance with a procedure approved by the General Assembly.""137.	When drawing up the Trusteeship Agreement the United Nations therefore not only recognized the validity of the international boundary agreements but also determined that the only outstanding issue was one of border demarcation. Yet Somalia wishes to change this simple issue of boundary demarcation into a territorial one.138.	Somalia's rejection of OAU decisions is based on the even more untenable premise that its dreams of expansion predate the establishment of the OAU. It is on this ground that Somalia refuses to accept the validity of OAU resolution AHG/Res.16 (I) of July 1964 which states  inter alia  that the OAU:""Considering that border problems constitute a grave and permanent factor of dissension ""Considering further that the borders of / 'can States  on the day of their independence  constitute a tangible reality ""Solemnly' declares that all Member States pledge themselves to respect the borders existing on their achievement of national independence.""139.	Thus Somalia would attempt to obstruct every effort by the OAU to play a constructive role because  according to its reverse logic  the Organization would always be younger than the dispute it would endeavour to settle.140.	Apart from its rejection of all international agreements  Somalia also maliciously attempts to portray Ethiopia as a ""black colonialist"". This  of course  is a deliberate distortion of history  designed to provide a rationale for Somalia's expansionist ambitions concerning Ethiopia. That Ethiopia through the centuries had to struggle against successive waves of colonialism is well known and recorded. The fact that it has by and large succeeded in holding on to what has always belonged to it surely cannot be invoked against it. Ethiopia  while maintaining its national independence  has however been a victim of colonial encroachments and intrigues.141.	In the face of the colonial scramble for Africa Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia wrote a circular letter to the European Powers on 10 April 1891 in which he specifically stated: ""If the powers at a distance come forward to partition Africa between them  I do not intend to be a silent spectator.""142.	Somalia's distorted interpretation of that letter has been heard very often. However  the explicit and implicit content of Menelik's letter was simply a clear warning to the Powers that he would resolutely defend the independence and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. As subsequent events have amply demonstrated  it is obvious that Menelik had neither the intention nor the dubious distinction of dismembering other African countries.143.	Distorted and malicious interpretations of his intentions notwithstanding  indeed Menelik did not remain a silent spectator. As it came to pass  five years later Italian colonialism launched its aggression against Ethiopia. Menelik kept his word by defeating the Italian colonialists at the historic battle of Adowa in 1896  thus dealing a blow to the myth of the invincibility of European colonial forces.144.	In its obsession with expansionism and the promotion of the illusion of Greater Somalia which it had inherited from its colonialist mentors  the Government of Somalia spares no effort in every forum to portray Ethiopia's demographic composition as if it were a negative phenomenon. Somalia does this with a view to manipulating this poly-ethnicity of the Ethiopian people for its own ends. There is no doubt that such a design is doomed to failure.145.	Like so many other nations  Ethiopia is proud of the religious  ethnic  linguistic and cultural diversity of its people—a diversity which is an asset  especially as it embarks upon progressive national reconstruction and development in conditions of freedom  justice and equality.146.	Not least important is the fact that the Mogadishu Government has often invoked the principle of self- determination to serve its own expansionist purposes. The principle of self-determination was enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations for the sole purpose of promoting the legitimate rights of peoples under colonial domination to freedom and independence. One beneficiary of this principle has been Somalia  which now wishes to distort its content and meaning to suit its expansionist designs. I should like to emphasize once and for all that the principle of self-determination was never conceived  nor is it meant to serve  as an instrument for the dismemberment of existing independent States.147.	As far as Ethiopia is concerned  because of the complementary nature of the resource endowments of the two countries  His Excellency Lt. Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam  Chairman of the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia  repeatedly reiterated previous proposals to the Somali authorities that we co-operate to develop the resources of the region for the mutual benefit of both countries  that we build a common infrastructure to help promote trade and that we jointly develop the Juba and the Wabi Shibelle river basins  which have their headwaters  in Ethiopia. Furthermore  in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and in the hope of speeding up the growth and development of the area through co-operation  the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia further proposed a confederation with Somalia. But Somalia's response to our peaceful and constructive proposals turned out to be the launching of a military offensive.148.	It is self-evident that in the face of the unprovoked aggression by the Somali regime the Ethiopian people have no choice but to rise in unison and repel that aggression as they have repeatedly done in the past when others have sought to violate their dignity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.149.	The Ethiopian people are comforted by the fact that their inherent right to defend the independence  unity and territorial integrity of their country is upheld by international law. It is this legitimate right to self-defence which they fully intend to exercise until all the consequences of Somalia's aggression are obliterated.150.	Somalia's aggression must be repulsed not only because it is directed against the honour and dignity of the Ethiopian people  but also because it seeks to set a dangerous precedent of instability in the African continent by attempting to transform national frontiers into ethnic boundaries. Somalia's aggression must be resisted because it is launched in utter contempt for the sacred principles enshrined in the charters of the OAU  the United Nations and the non-aligned movement. The determined effort of the Ethiopian people to safeguard the territorial integrity of their country is  therefore  not only a fully justified act of self-defence but also an act to uphold the sanctity of these fundamental principles.151.	The OAU as the competent regional organization to deal with. African problems  continues to be seized of the issues involving Somalia's aggression. In this regard  the General Assembly is well aware of the decision taken at Libreville  Gabon  last August  by the good offices committee of the OAU. By reaffirming the principles of territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  that decision has rejected Somalia's policy of expansionism. Ethiopia continues to have full confidence in the efficacy of the OAU and believes that that regional organization should be afforded every opportunity and all co-operation to resolve the problem in accordance with the provisions of its Charter and the relevant decisions of its principal organs.152.	If I have dwelt at some length on the brazen aggression being committed against my country by Somalia  it is because we believe that it is our duty to apprise the international community of all aspects of the hostilities now raging in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia  as a foundingMember of both the United Nations and the OAU is a nation unequivocally committed to the scrupulous respect of all the fundamental principles of international law that govern the conduct of States in their relations with each other and  as such  in its commitment to peace it is second to none.153.	Ethiopia has always preferred to solve its differences with others through peaceful means rather than by resorting to force. But when  as in the present case  naked aggression is committed against it in contemptuous disregard of the principles of civilized conduct  then no alternative is left to it other than the obligation to act in determined self-defence. That is what the Ethiopian people are now actually engaged in. The international community will no doubt recall that the Ethiopian people successfully defended the honour of their country against Fascist aggression four decades ago. Prepared as they are to make every sacrifice in defending their national unity and territorial integrity  the Ethiopian people are once again determined to discharge their historical obligation of legitimate self-defence in accordance with the charters of the OAU and the United Nations.

"44",2313,"FIN",32,1977,"﻿1.	Mr. President  I wish to convey to you the congratulations of the Finnish Government on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We greet you as a statesman with wide experience in European and United Nations affairs. You also represent a country that has greatly contributed to security and co-operation in Europe as well as to international co-operation globally by its active role in the movement of the non-aligned countries. Your election  furthermore  marks a year when important negotiations serving both these ends take place in Belgrade.2.	I am also glad to welcome the two new Members of the United Nations  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti.3.	It is customary in this general debate to review the main international events since the latest session of the General Assembly. In my statement I shall concentrate on what the Finnish Government believes are the main trends in the world today These can be put in three words: detente  disarmament and development. Each depends on the other; none can progress in isolation.4.	The principal purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security  but this is not a static concept; today it is more dynamic than ever. It comprises economic and social development and increased respect for human rights. As the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the Organization  the practical problem in this process has been to find a working balance between national sovereignty and national interests on the one hand and international order and the long-term interests of the world community on the other. Over the years the search for this balance has had its moments of hope as well as of disappointment. But the search must go on. The Finnish Government for its part continues to lend its full support to the world Organization in this important.5.	The agenda of the world community remains overwhelming in size and urgency. Thus in the minds of many optimism may seem unwarranted. Yet there are encouraging elements. The international community is becoming increasingly aware that the problems facing it can only be solved by showing determination tempered by patience and tolerance.6.	Such determination has been shown in one of the essential areas of international detente—the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.7.	In full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  is a unanimously adopted set of provisions aimed at reducing tensions as well as establishing friendly and active relations between its participating States. In our experience the Final Act has already proved to be a useful instrument in strengthening security and promoting international co-operation.8.	The importance of this process to the world community at large should not be underestimated.9.	I should like to reaffirm in this forum the commitment of the Government of Finland to do its share to promote this process. We look forward with confidence to the first follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which in a few days will begin its deliberations in Belgrade in order to take stock of the progress made until now and to plan future action.10.	The interconnection of international security and international co-operation is the central element h relations between nations. The strengthening of security through co-operation is not just one option among others; it is the only option open. Nor is it a process that takes place by itself once an international framework such as the United Nations is given. On the contrary  it requires indispensably the active participation of all nations. The great Powers have a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  but lasting results can only be achieved with the full participation of all States  big and small  each according to its political profile.11.	It has been generally orally accepted that détente and disarmament are two intertwined process long run the survival of detente is condition;	progress in disarmament. One proof of this is that whenever have disarmament issues been negotiated as international as today. Some progress on a number of disarmament issues has been made  but. many remain impatient at the meager results of arms limitation. 12.	Because of this it has become popular to blame the arms race on the major Powers and on them only. While this may give an easy excuse for those who want to continue their local arms races  the international community can ill afford such simplified explanations. Regardless of its quantitative or qualitative dimensions  the arms build-up is the result of complex political  economic and technological processes.13.	New developments in weapons technology  particularly in the strategic and nuclear fields  have caused concern both on the global level and in many regions. The deployment of new types of weapons may give rise to a new round of the arms race. To avert this impending danger the world community must organize itself to increase its control over these processes and developments. Thus  the joint search for disarmament should be seen as a joint search for security. The Government of Finland expects that this search will be carried out thoroughly and realistically at the forthcoming special session devoted to disarmament.14.	After these observations a word is due on one of the most pressing disarmament issues- the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Finnish Government continues to believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  is a solid foundation for further efforts in this field. Those disappointments that have been encountered in the efforts to contain the spread of nuclear weapons do not lie in the alleged weaknesses of the non-proliferation Treaty. Rather the reason is in the failure of the international community to use the Treaty as an effective instrument against the dangers of proliferation. The prospect of nuclear explosives in South Africa is a telling reminder of the danger of nuclear proliferation.15.	Adherence to the non-proliferation Treaty is a contribution to the security of all States concerned. This should also be reflected in the terms applied in international co-operation and trade in nuclear materials and technology for peaceful purposes. The fundamental of the non-proliferation Treaty will become eroded if States that have not pledged themselves to refrain from using peaceful nuclear facilities for military purposes can benefit from international nuclear co-operation. Therefore  one of the key tasks of today is to strengthen the non-proliferation Treaty and make the commitment to non-proliferation fully universal.16.	While we must continue to work for detente on a global scale  we are still awaiting a break-through in the main conflict areas of the world. One of the most difficult obstacles is the white minority rule and its repression of the vast majority of the people in southern Africa. This cannot be tolerated. There must be a change and there will be a change. The essential question is whether this change takes place through consent rather than bloodshed and violence.17.	With this in mind  the Nordic Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Helsinki earlier this month expressed the readiness of the five Nordic Governments to offer then- services within the framework of the United Nations with a view to facilitating peaceful solutions in Namibia and Zimbabwe. They also established a working group to investigate the possibilities of a joint action programme for further economic measures against South Africa. The Assembly will recall that earlier they proposed that the Security Council should transform the voluntary arms embargo against South Africa into a mandatory arms embargo. They also stated that it would be a significant action if the Security Council made a decision aimed at preventing new foreign investments in South Africa. Those positions stand.18.	In southern Africa we are approaching a situation where the credibility of the United Nations and its very capacity to live up to the Charter are seriously undermined. If the present opportunities for peaceful solutions are not seized  we shall face a situation where the world Organization collectively and Member States individually will have to review their stands in order to protect the basic principles of the Charter.19.	Over the last year  declarations by Arab and Israeli leaders containing a tone of moderation and realism have given the international community reason to hope for the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. Mutual distrust has  however  so far seriously hampered the efforts  to get the negotiating process involving all parties to the conflict under way. The momentum which nevertheless has been achieved should not be allowed to lapse. Therefore  it is particularly important that none of the parties now takes steps which are perceived as adding to the obstacles and thus leading ultimately to further frustrations and perhaps a serious international crisis.20.	The Finnish Government continues to support the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. They create conditions for peace-building that should be fully utilized by the parties concerned.21.	Peace-keeping operations place a heavy financial burden on the Organization and on troop-contributing countries in particular. It is therefore necessary that the General Arguably should devote special attention to the consideration of the whole question of peace-keeping financing. This question should be examined not only in relation to the future but also as a problem which places the present peace-keeping operations in serious jeopardy.22.	The efforts to reshape the world economic and social order are parallel to the quest for detente and disarmament and pursue the same goals. Indeed  they are just different facets of global interdependence. Success or failure in one has profound effects on the other; the continued diversion of material and human resources to military ends is a conscious choice against development and contrary to the stated aims of the United Nations.23.	As a recognition of this fact the Nordic countries have proposed that within the framework of the special session on disarmament a new comprehensive study on the link between disarmament and development be undertaken.24.	Much to our regret-but not unexpectedly-the resumed session the General Assembly  was not able to arrive at any consensus assessment of the results of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation. This should  however  not discourage the Assembly. Progress on a number of issues was achieved. It is also encouraging that a will to negotiate prevailed. The problems of economic and social development are of such magnitude and such vital importance to the entire membership of the United Nations that we must pursue the negotiations together until we reach satisfactory results. In this we must show determination and courage.25.	We are now facing a twofold challenge: to preserve a favourable negotiating atmosphere between the North and the South and to make vigorous efforts to build on the groundwork laid in recent global conferences. We must do everything possible to prevent a sliding back to a collision course-the price for all of us but especially for the least developed and the most seriously affected countries would be too high. A period of stagnation such as the world economy is now experiencing creates immense pressures. Solutions to these problems can only be found in international co-operation. We are too interdependent to afford confrontation.26.	The other part of the challenge consists of making maximum use of the results of the negotiations which admittedly have been limited so far. Three important milestones mark the road ahead: the Integrated Programme for Commodities with its common fund  the solution of the debt problem of the developing countries and the increase of official development assistance. These issues are all of critical significance to the developing countries  and Finland will fully support the search for solutions in these areas. In order to move more effectively towards the target for official development assistance Finland has decided to set a medium-term target of at least doubling the present level of its official development assistance.27.	Along with attacking the three most immediate challenges to which 1 just referred the United Nations must also respond to a longer-term challenge towards securing the establishment of the new international economic order. I am referring to the formulation of a new global development strategy. That should essentially be aimed at achieving what in the 1960s and 1970s remained an unattainable goal: the substantial raising of the material and cultural level of the poorest segments of the world's societies. It must imply a frontal attack on mass poverty. It must strike a balance between the growth needs of nations and the right to a life in security and dignity of the individual human being. Furthermore  it is not possible in our view to speak about development only in terms of growth and quantitative resources. Development must also mean a qualitative change in society  in the lives of its members. They will respond by engaging their will and energy in the development process. In particular  the participation of women must be activated in full equality with men in accordance with the world programme of the United Nations Decade for Women.28.	In this connection  I should also like to say a few words more generally about the approach taken by Finland to human rights as an issue in international affairs. Our own values in this field are based on the Nordic traditions of freedom  solidarity and justice. By ratifying the International Covenants on Human Rights and numerous other instruments in the United Nations system we have demonstrated our belief that human rights are a matter of importance for peace and good relations between States. It must be strongly emphasized that this applies to all human rights-civic and political  as well as economic  social and cultural rights. Some of the burning political problems of the world  such as those related to the situations in southern Africa and the Middle East  are also at bottom human rights problems. Social and economic development as a whole can be regarded as an effort to promote human rights.29.	International work in this field can best be carried out on the basis of common  accepted codes of conduct; no purpose is served by attempts to impose one set of values on another. Efforts to find common ground are therefore of primary importance. We see a great task for all countries in promoting and implementing human rights  both nationally and internationally. Success in this task will help to strengthen the rule of law and to build a durable world order in peace and security. 	"
"45",2358,"FJI",32,1977,"﻿148.	Mr. President  though the general debate is drawing to a close  it is still appropriate for me to associate myself with previous speakers who have congratulated you most warmly on your election to preside over this session.149.	In congratulating you  Sir  I am most mindful of the outstanding manner in which your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  presided over the deliberations of last year's session. It is appropriate  too  to pay a tribute to his contributions to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  where his expertise and diplomatic skill have been invaluable.150.	It is always a pleasure and a source of great satisfaction to welcome new Members. On this occasion I welcome to our membership the Republic of Djibouti. We also welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to our midst  and we are hopeful that their membership will enrich the United Nations.151.	On a sadder note  we should like to be associated with the expressions of condolence to the people and Government of Yemen on the untimely death of President Ibrahim Al-Hamdi.152.	When we met last year there was an atmosphere of optimism and expectation. The Middle East situation  Cyprus  southern Africa and the North-South dialogue were but four of the major issues on which there were hopes that solutions would be found Yet in retrospect it was perhaps too early and premature to be so optimistic. For  after all  those problems have exercised the minds and the attention of the international community for a number of years  and it is apparent  on reflection  that to expect settlement overnight would have been unrealistic. Yet the world  and especially the developing world  is not to be blamed for its optimism  for in our view a settlement of these outstanding world problems would  we hope  release energies and resources for the solution of important and pressing problems  problems which beset every developing country  namely  how to improve the living conditions of our people  who for years have been condemned to an existence characterized by hunger  malnutrition  diseases  poor water supply  poor housing and illiteracy.153.	Despite continuing efforts to achieve a just and durable peace in the Middle East  the situation had remained stalled and uncertain until very recently. Much has been done since the Assembly met last  and the prospect of an early reconvening of the Geneva Conference augurs well for the settlement of this explosive situation. Yet these efforts have been marred by what appears to be inflexibility of attitudes. Moreover  the legalization of settlements in-lands occupied since 1967 has merely added more fuel to the fire.154.	We  for our part  maintain our position that Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 provide the over-all framework for further negotiations. In this regard  the right of all the States of the region  including Israel  to exist in peace within secure and recognized boundaries must be emphasized along with the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a homeland. In our view  these constitute important elements the recognition of which should  we hope  greatly enhance the prospects for lasting peace and security in that region.155.	In the case of Cyprus  we also find that the continuing efforts being made towards resolving the communal difficulties  regrettably  have not as yet yielded any positive results. We are very conscious of the important role undertaken by the United Nations in an effort to encourage an early resolution of this problem. We should like to express the hope that continuing consultations and negotiations will lead to a solution that will be in harmony and will be consistent with the wishes of the people of Cyprus.156.	The United Nations since its inception has played a vital and active role in the field of decolonization. The near universality of membership of this Organization is testimony enough of this Organization's efforts and contributions in this field. However  despite this unprecedented effort some 12 million people remain in bondage  including those of southern Africa. Zimbabwe and Namibia remain under colonial domination  and despite the best efforts of the international community progress towards a just and equitable solution remains slow and painful. We hope though that the recent Anglo-American initiative will bear fruit by enabling the people of Zimbabwe to achieve majority rule as soon as possible.157.	As if those two territories are not enough to tax the efforts of this Organization  the scourge of apartheid continues to dominate and permeate the entire life of South Africa. It is difficult to comprehend the mentality of those who espouse this particular philosophy. Men who otherwise are rational seem completely immune and insensitive to any feeling of realism and balance in their espousal of the cause of apartheid. We continue to hope that the South African regime will mend its ways before the world witnesses another holocaust of frightening proportions.158.	But  while the international community has devoted time and efforts to southern Africa  we believe the Assembly needs to be reminded that there continue to be remnants of colonialism in other parts of the world  notably in the South Pacific. While some of the colonial Territories are moving towards full internal self-government and independence  others remain tightly in the grip of their metropolitan masters. There is very little indication as yet of willingness  let alone readiness  on the part of the metropolitan Powers concerned to prepare these Territories for independence should they so wish it. There appears to be a conscious and deliberate effort to wean these Territories away from ever thinking about independence  and any movement towards self-determination is discouraged if not suppressed. On the other hand  some dependent Territories have been so inundated with help from their colonial Powers that the people of those Territories have not been encouraged to be self-reliant and thereby realize their full potential. A dependency syndrome has become so deeply embedded that these people know of no other choice but perpetual dependency. Moreover  the presence of military troops ostensibly for internal security purposes appears to be out of proportion to real needs.159.	If this is not enough  some of those Territories have been and are continuing to be used for the testing of nuclear devices  despite repeated protests by the countries of the south Pacific for the cessation of those tests. It is a matter of regret and a great disappointment to us that to date there does not appear to be any significant change in- the attitude of those conducting such tests. At the same time  we hope that our differences on this issue  which to us is a matter of principle  will not be a constraint on the development of mutual co-operation on matters of common interest.160.	Colonialism does not express itself merely in the acquisition of overseas territories. That type of colonialism is fast dying out. It would be naive though to think that colonialism is completely dead. It has merely taken on new forms  new manifestations  which in some instances are more pernicious and more pervasive in their effects than territorial acquisition. A new form of colonialism has of late reared its head and we in the south Pacific  and more particularly my own country  have experienced with some concern this new phenomenon. I refer to the deliberate and calculated interference by foreign trade unions in the internal affairs of my own country. Speaking about this phenomenon  my Prime Minister  the Right Honourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said:""No nation can long preserve its democratic ideals  or pursue economic progress  where the law of the land is flouted and the law of the jungle takes its place. No sovereign independent country  however small  can retain its national pride if it does not resist to the uttermost all attempts to encroach on its own internal affairs by foreign interests. It will be a sad day if we have achieved independence From political colonialism  if we are beginning to free ourselves from commercial colonialism  only to suffer from the colonialism of foreign trade unions: a colonialism of trade unions  moreover  which expected the Government to interfere with the process of law against those who had unlawfully obstructed our officials and police"".161.	But let me add that the Governments from which these trade unions operate dissociate themselves from these acts of interference. What is frightening  though  is the arrogance which they allow these trade unions to act with impunity. We fear that if this type of behaviour is not curbed  small countries  especially those of us who are dependent on trade by sea  can be subjected to victimization of the most deplorable type The question we should like to pose is  Is there no limit to the freedom in which individuals or groups of individuals can or are allowed to take action which is or may be detrimental to the welfare of others? We reiterate our concern in this matter  having particular regard to the importance of observing the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of a country and to the respect due to the sovereign independence of a State.162.	Fiji looks forward to next year’s special session on disarmament. We are hopeful that the special session will eventually 16ad to curbs in the development  manufacture and sale of arms. We share the view and expectation that this will lead to the release of resources which will be made available to improve the lives of the world's poor and the deprived. Small countries have little influence on this matter. All we can do is to add our voice to the collective voice of mankind in expressing our concern that resources which could and should be put to better uses continue to be used for the production of instruments of war and mass destruction. We believe that whatever resources are released from the development and production of arms should be added to what is already being made available for development purposes. Our concern for disarmament is made the more urgent because of the continued use of the south Pacific for the testing of nuclear devices. In this regard  we welcome the current initiative by the United Kingdom  the United States and the Soviet Union to reach agreement to ban underground testing. We also express the hope that other nuclear Powers will join this initiative. We hope too that agreement will be reached on a comprehensive test-ban treaty in the near future.163.	We are of the view that a just and beneficial regime for the oceans is essential to world peace. Failure would seriously impair confidence in global treaty-making and in the very process of multilateral accommodation. However  a comprehensive treaty on the law of the sea would mark a major step forward in the equitable exploitation of the resources of the sea. A co-operative and equitable solution can lead to new patterns of accommodation between the developing and the industrialized countries. It could give added momentum to the dialogue between the industrial and developing countries. We appreciate  of course  that each nation has its own vital interests to protect in the negotiations on the law of the sea.164.	For us in Fiji  and indeed in the south Pacific  the successful conclusion of the current Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is urgent and vital. We are not blessed by nature with any great land mass  nor with very many natural resources. We are a sea-going people. Our lives  our livelihood and our culture are intimately woven and mingled with the sea. We live by and with the sea. Most of our proteins are derived from the sea. In terms of economic development we see our future in the continued exploitation of our marine resources. No country  however  can hope to develop its sea resources in isolation. Indeed  for many countries represented here it is the sea which provides the direct links between us. As a member of the international community  we are committed to work towards a total package for the law of the sea and the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty. Consequently  we have followed and will continue to follow the proceedings of the Conference on the Law of the Sea with great care and attention. Within the south Pacific  the countries in the area have  through the South Pacific Forum  decided to establish a regional fisheries agency to help us in the management of our sea resources. In this regard  Fiji expresses the hope that the countries which now exploit the marine resources of the south Pacific will recognize this agency and support it  thereby ensuring that the people of the south Pacific will derive the maximum benefit from the exploitation of the marine resources around them. The returns of such exploitation to the people of the south Pacific have to date been minimal.165.	Our concern for the successful conclusion of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is also a reflection of our concern for a genuine restructuring of the international economic order to ensure that developing countries are not perpetually condemned to a hand-to-mouth existence. We continue to be amazed at the reluctance of the industrialized countries to accommodate the wishes of the developing countries. While we recognize that there are difficulties  what is painfully obvious at the same time is the frightening wastage of resources by the industrialized countries. Demands are induced  and only too often most of what is produced is allowed to go to waste. Yet if agreement is to be reached  we believe that dialogue must continue. Although the North-South dialogue came to an inconclusive end  it is our feeling that only by continued dialogue will we ever hope to reach agreement. We know that this demands patience. We know that this requires skill and dedication on the part of those involved.166.	While there have been difficulties in the North-South dialogue  there has  however  been some movement in the relations between some industrialized and some developing countries  notably the European Economic Community and the African-Caribbean-Pacific countries. We believe  with all its limitations  the Lome Convention is indicative of what can be done.167.	The mounting cost of imports of both manufactured goods and petroleum products -has stretched the meagre resources of most developing countries to the breaking- point. In this regard  the small island countries of the Pacific have been among those worst hit by this problem. We are bereft of natural resources. We have small land areas. We are far from our markets. Our agricultural commodities are subject to wild fluctuations in price. We are vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods  which appear to occur with monotonous regularity. We have received considerable help from both multilateral and bilateral sources. We are particularly grateful to the various organs of the United Nations system and to our near neighbours  New Zealand and Australia. However  we have the feeling that our part of the world is the forgotten part  and that whatever help we receive tends to be given with reluctance.168.	It is our view that the needs of island communities deserve greater attention than that given to date. We do not believe that these islands want help in the form of charity. We are not beggars or parasites. What we would like is help to assist us in developing whatever resources we have so that we could live with dignity.169.	We feel  too  that the criteria designating countries to be classified as least developed need to be re-examined and that island territories should be or ought to be automatically classified as such unless they have extraordinary resources. Again there is a lack of balance in this regard and the classification of least developed countries has been heavily weighted in favour of certain countries. At the same time  developing island countries which have been able to improve their standard of living through careful management have been unduly penalized because their per capita income is high. It is our view that assessing a country's need for help purely on the basis of per capita income can be grossly misleading. Only too often a very distorted picture emerges which does not in any way conform to reality. Nowhere else has such a distorted picture been so damaging as in the case of island communities. We would hope that specialized agencies and others would take another look at this issue. We can only invite the attention of other island communities  particularly those of the Caribbean  to work with us on this matter.170.	In concluding this -statement  I am conscious of the heavy burden which this Organization carries. My delegation expresses the hope that this session  under your distinguished leadership  will mark a turning-point in the work of the United Nations for world peace  security and justice. The late President John F. Kennedy  in addressing the United Nations on 25 September 1961  summed up the hope of this Organization with optimism when he said: however close we sometimes seem to that dark and final abyss  let no man of peace and freedom despair. For he does not stand alone. If we all can persevere  if we can in every land and office look beyond our own shores and ambitions  then surely the age will dawn in which the strong are just and the weak secure  and the peace preserved.""

"46",2404,"FRA",32,1977,"﻿154.	 Mr. President  there are many reasons why my delegation welcomes your accession to the office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Allow me first of all to greet you as a former colleague  since you were the Permanent Representative of Yugoslavia when I was head of France's Permanent Mission in New York. Your strength of character and sound political instincts  your acknowledged competence and the esteem in which you are held make me certain that you will conduct our work here with unchallenged authority.155.	Yugoslavia has created a special place for itself on the international scene: as a founder and leading member of the group of non-aligned countries  an active member of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  as well as of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  and the initiator of the special session on disarmament to be held next year. Your country clearly perceives the problems of the day  whether in the context of East-West relations or the North-South dialogue. France is especially pleased with the fresh opportunity our two Heads of State will soon have to strengthen still further the ties of friendship and co-operation which link our countries.156.	I am equally pleased with the brilliant re-election of our Secretary-General  whose outstanding qualifications have been rightly endorsed by that renewed expression of our confidence.157.	The current world situation is neither good nor reassuring. With the exception of the positive outcome of the lengthy Panama Canal negotiations  none of the major disputes under consideration in our Organization has made genuine progress towards a settlement. Human rights continue to be violated in several countries  including countries which were once proud of their liberal and humanistic traditions. It is high time that the texts formally adopted in this area guide the conduct of Governments.158.	Moreover  the difficulties that our economies have been experiencing in recent years may well lead too many nations to look inwardly in the vain hope of evading the rule that governs today's world-the rule of interdependence.159.	In the face of these persisting tensions  threats and uncertainties  it is more necessary than ever to turn away from fatalistic philosophies. For France  detente arid dialogue cannot be mere slogans.160.	France initiated the policy of detente in Europe convinced of the merits of that policy  and we will not give it up. We will pursue it without yielding an inch on the most basic points  which are our country's security and independence  and respect for human rights. We will follow it without falling prey to doubts  even understandable ones  which could undermine the foundations of detente.161.	These are the principles of the joint declaration signed on 22 June of this year at Rambouillet by the President of the French Republic  Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing  and the President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Mr. Leonid Brezhnev  during his state visit to France. These are also the principles that will determine our attitude at the forthcoming Belgrade conference.162.	With regard to the North-South dialogue which France initiated in the form of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  we believe that the results of this unprecedented meeting are far from negative. Differences did of course appear in the reactions it elicited. This is only natural at the preliminary stages of so vast an undertaking. The final report  drawn up by the experts  however  shows that the Conference made real progress over previous talks in several areas; this was true in the area of raw materials  for one  where the principle of establishing a common fund represents an important step; and also on the subject of the transfer of resources  thanks to new financial commitments by the industrialized nations; and in the area of African development  especially in the context of the 10-year programme to develop transport and telecommunications which will have the backing of the developed countries. Useful talks were held on other important issues such as indebtedness  export earnings  investment and energy.163.	It is now up to us to continue our efforts according to procedures on which we agree. The new world economic order cannot simply be decreed; we will have to build it step by step. By the same token  the dialogue between North and South  which is so important for the world  must be a continuing process that takes into account the interests of everyone  and therefore implies a commitment by one and all.164.	At this point I will reiterate that it is up to the socialist countries to make their contribution to this ambitious undertaking. The difference between our philosophies and systems should not veil the interdependence which has become the law of our planet.165.	We are all experiencing this interdependence with growing awareness in the area of our planet's natural resources  especially energy resources. Those who have these resources have the right to a fair price for them  without  however  exposing the world economy to disorders of which they  too  would be victims. It is the imperative duty of those who live in affluence to eliminate waste. The future of our entire community requires us to manage our energy resources in common  whether they are oil  other fossil fuels  new energy sources—which have yet to be fully explored-or nuclear energy  which we must put to the service of a peaceful future.166.	Growing energy needs and a desire to diversify energy-supply sources have forced many countries to turn to nuclear means. The price we pay for this must not be proliferation of nuclear weapons  which would put humanity in mortal danger  it is in this light that we should view the international co-operation which has already been started by my country  for one  and which is aimed at reconciling the requirements of non-proliferation with the need to use more nuclear energy.167.	The negotiations under way on the law of the sea will be a decisive test of whether we are capable of using our scientific know-how and adapting our laws to a higher level of organization. We are not simply dealing with exploitation  however more rational and equitable it may be; we are also concerned with preserving all the sources of life at the international as well as national levels.168.	Such major undertakings cannot be completed while States and peoples live in the shadow of threats and domination  injustice and disunity.169.	That is why France  drawing on its experience  is continuing its co-operation with the Soviet Union and the countries of the East at the European level; that is also why France is still determined  despite the crisis  to achieve with its partners in the Community the ambitious goals of European construction. The nine members of the Community are asserting their collective identity more and more in international bodies by expressing common views on many subjects  as they did during the Conference onInternational Economic Co-operation. By the same token  the day before yesterday  the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs  current President of the Community  explained the position of the nine countries on many items on the agenda. France is convinced that political co-operation among the members of the Community makes a significant contribution to our work.170.	But the determination Europe has shown in overcoming its old quarrels  making detente prevail and embarking on the path of co-operation is far from being expressed in other areas of the world.171.	The situation in the Middle East unfortunately illustrates this point. All of us  and France above all  welcomed the return to peace in Lebanon with the deepest satisfaction. President Sarkis is to be commended for his steadfast efforts to restore authority and see that the unity  integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon are restored. France  which had been set on rendering assistance to a people dear to it  believes that now more than ever the existence of an independent  united  free and prosperous Lebanon is indispensable for the equilibrium of the region. The very disturbing situation in the south of the country shows none the less that the security and stability of Lebanon depend heavily on the course of the conflict in the Middle East.172.	We are unfortunately still far from a settlement. The desire for peace that I had noted during my visits to the region several months ago have so far not been enough to commit the parties to the path of negotiation. The entrenchment of positions may compromise the efforts under way  and thus gravely affect the stability of the States and the very future of the peoples of the Middle East. And yet the principles which must shape any settlement are not only known but are now accepted by the international community.173.	The first principle is the evacuation by Israel of the territories occupied in 1967. Peace cannot  in fact  be founded on conquest  on the occupation of territories  or on a fait accompli.174.	The recognition of the rights of the Palestinians to a homeland is the second fundamental principle. To refuse to grant a people which is displaced or living under an occupation regime the right to a homeland where it can fully express its national identity would be to ignore the fact that nothing lasting can be founded on irredentism. which would doom to failure all attempts at a settlement.175.	The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in our meeting halls  together with our conviction that it is essential for the Palestinians to be associated with the negotiations which will decide their fate  underscores the degree to which this crucial aspect of the conflict is now recognized. It is time that the Palestinian people were granted the opportunity to live in a system and under conditions of their own choosing; it is time this opportunity was included in the terms for a global solution.176.	I also want to repeat that recognition of the existence of all the States in the region  including Israel  within secure  recognized and guaranteed boundaries  is another mandatory requirement of any settlement. After so many cruel wars  a genuine peace  implying normal relations  has to be found for this region so that the resources and talents of all sides can finally be employed to promote development and prosperity.177.	It is important  however  that no one should jeopardize the desired outcome by making gestures that lead nowhere and belie the will to negotiate which has been otherwise clearly displayed. Several measures recently taken by Israel in the occupied territories have given us cause for grave concern. Actions such as these do more than violate international law and the resolutions of the United Nations: they create a climate unconducive to negotiations to a time when the other States have expressed their readiness to seek peace agreements.178.	At the eastern end of the Mediterranean another de facto situation persists. Efforts to find a settlement to the problem of Cyprus continue to meet with suspicion and resentment. The death of President Makarios - and I should like to pay a tribute here to the memory of that patriot and statesman-should not delay our quest for the goal to which we are still committed: namely  to bring about a reconciliation between the Greek and Turkish communities  and to preserve the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We hope that the Secretary-General will continue the mission entrusted to him by the Security Council two years ago  and that the bases for a comprehensive settlement will be actively explored with his assistance and that of his Special Representative without pre-conditions and without regard for the de facto situation.179.	It is hard to imagine what other reasonable approach might be substituted for the current efforts: the present method of giving the communities themselves responsibility for drawing up the terms of a settlement corresponds to the particular nature of a dispute that could only be aggravated still further if it were extended. While the solution sought by the negotiators will have to take into account the strong individuality of the parties concerned  it will also have to contain a satisfactory answer to the important problem of the refugees and provide for a reasonable territorial settlement through significant adjustments in the present line of separation.180.	Africa  to which France is linked by so many ties  has been the special focus of my Government's concerns this year. Our position rests on the following principles. First  it is for the African countries themselves to resolve their differences and accordingly reject any interference that would make Africa an arena for external rivalry. Secondly  the solidarity that exists between France and Africa is practiced with full respect for the sovereignty of all States. Thirdly  the security and stability of the continent  the best guarantee of its development  will not be assured so long as the questions of southern Africa remain unsolved  be it Namibia  Rhodesia or the odious system of apartheid.181.	In the case of Namibia  first of all  my country  which is taking an active part in the efforts currently being pursued by the five Powers that are members of the Security Council  believes that free elections should be held under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all the political organizations in the Territory  including the South West Africa People's Organization.182.	As far as Rhodesia is concerned  by stubbornly refusing to allow the black population of Zimbabwe to exercise its political rights  the rebel Government in Salisbury is bringing a growing threat to bear on the entire region and is undermining the security of Mozambique and Zambia. France supports the action taken by the United Kingdom and the United States in conjunction with the countries and liberation movements concerned.183.	Since the South African regime is based on the unacceptable system of apartheid  the risk of worsening tension which may disintegrate into racial war continues to grow. These grave perils were reason enough for the Conferences in Maputo  and Lagos   at which apartheid was unanimously condemned.184.	If decisive progress is not achieved in solving these questions and if the necessary changes are not made  South Africa may well become increasingly isolated in our community  with the consequences that would inevitably result from this. In addition to the voluntary ban on arms sales which our countries  including France  have successively imposed  a code of conduct for companies with subsidiaries  branches or representation in South Africa was recently adopted by the nine countries of the European Community.185.	South Africa was allegedly planning a nuclear explosion. The South African Prime Minister made a statement in which he said that his Government did not plan to acquire nuclear weapons. I have taken note of this. As I said last month  if that were not the case  it could jeopardize all the current peace efforts  and we would be obliged to react.186.	At this point I should like once again to dispose of a ridiculous allegation to the effect that a very common type of electronuclear plant  which has not even been built yet  has supposedly served or could have served in the manufacture of atomic weapons by the Pretoria regime. France and several other industrialized countries are building and exporting dozens of reactors for the peaceful production of nuclear energy which is needed throughout the world. As far as South Africa is concerned  the strictest controls are stipulated and precautions have been increased. The problems of proliferation with which we must concern ourselves are too serious to be left to malice and stupidity.187.	In addition to these persistent sources of tension  armed conflict has flared up among African countries themselves elsewhere on the continent. It is at the conference table  in the framework of its own institutions and through the efforts of its own mediators that Africa traditionally settles its problems. We hope that this will continue to be the case. Disunity in Africa on the procedures to be followed and appeals for massive outside help  whether for troops or weapons  would soon make the Africans pawns in	struggles. The motto  Africa for the Africans  implies respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  the right of these States to security in the framework of their own political options and the rejection of all outside interference.188.	This principle has guided and still guides France in its relations with all the African countries. The process of decolonization  which we began on that continent nearly 20 years ago  was recently completed when Djibouti acceded to independence following a referendum and elections that the Organization for African Unity  the United Nations and the League of Arab States witnessed as being democratic. My country  which has already established ties of co-operation with the new State  hopes that it will avoid becoming embroiled in the ambitions and confrontations swirling dangerously around it. It is with very great pleasure that I welcome here the presence of the delegation from Djibouti  which is making its debut in the international community.189.	France feels and shows solidarity for countries it has been closely associated with through history  and we are fully prepared to demonstrate the same solidarity in the Comoros- Misunderstandings are still evident in the interpretation of certain decisions regarding the island of Mayotte. The inhabitants of that island have opted by vote in favour of a future different from that of their neighbors. The status of the island does  however  leave them the possibility of stating their position about their future on another occasion. France will not stand in the way of any course of action  provided it is followed with mutual regard for the rights of the parties.190.	France respects the sovereignty of each African State and has joined in the development effort of the countries of the continent  but we strongly decry the tragic fate of two French nationals killed on 1 May in Zouerate and six others kidnapped while carrying out peaceful work to benefit the economic progress of Mauritania. The taking of hostages directly contravenes international conventions; and it is to be condemned even more because so far  despite the efforts of our Secretary-General and the International Red Cross  it has been impossible for us to obtain the precise information needed to reassure fully their families. We cannot allow men and women dedicated to peaceful work to be brought into conflicts unrelated to them. I formally request the international organizations and Governments that are in contact with those who kidnapped our compatriots to assist us in obtaining their release.191.	In endeavoring to explain France's position on the major sources of tension today  I have been obliged to omit references to situations in other areas of the world which have been less in need of our Assembly's attention. I should like  nevertheless  to repeat here my delegation's best wishes to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which has finally joined our Organization. The sponsorship France gave this country shows how important we believed it was to obtain its contribution to our work.192.	 In spite of our commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  we cannot remain silent in the face of the news reaching us from Kampuchea. In the name of the friendship France feels for the Khmer people  I express the hope that this StateMember of our Organization will respect the fundamental rights of the human being as set forth in our Charter.193.	I could not conclude these brief remarks about the Asian continent without praising the very good relations my country enjoys with the People's Republic of China  a country that holds a unique place in world affairs commensurate with its historic and human dimensions.194.	I should now like to take up a subject that has traditionally been one of the central themes of the discussions and work of our Assembly. My Government has always believed that the arms reduction effort is vital for peace in the world  for the development of States and the prosperity of peoples. It intends to make a positive contribution to the preparation of the special session to be devoted to this subject in May 1978: first of all because for 20 years my country has constantly spoken out in favour of general  complete and controlled disarmament  and we intend to continue to work in this direction; secondly  because our defence has been organized on the basis of our profoundly peaceful policy with the sole aim of preserving our independence and guaranteeing our security; and lastly because France is located in a region of the world where  despite a manifest spirit of detente  means of destruction continue to grow and to be perfected.195.	We cannot resign ourselves to the apparently inevitable build-up of nuclear and conventional weapons  and we cannot fail to deplore the senseless squandering of resources that could be put to better use for development. In 1976 $350 billion was spent on arms.196.	We cannot remain indifferent to the intense competition among certain Powers  resulting in a perpetual increase in their overcapacity for mutual destruction.197.	Lastly  we cannot observe without concern the constant perfecting of technologies and of the most sophisticated means of destruction and death.198.	The effort to reduce arsenals is therefore one of the priorities of our era  and we must not be satisfied with mere appearances.199.	Of course for years there have been attempts to prohibit or limit certain types of weapons. Banning means of destruction that have not yet been produced  or agreeing to phase out gradually weapons of apparently dubious or  marginal military importance  stems from praiseworthy intentions. But because measures such as these are still partial  they can only give an illusion of disarmament and do not make any substantial contribution to the reduction of weapons or to the greater safety of the international community.200.	By the same token  the efforts of the two superpowers to ensure a balance in their strategic relationship  however desirable these efforts may be  should not in and of themselves be confused with the over-all disarmament effort.201.	As anyone can see  the problem of verifying commitments is fundamental in the quest for arms reduction and greater safety.202.	For there to be disarmament  there must be a genuine reduction of arsenals. The major Powers should take a part in this common effort consistent with the part they have played in the last 30 years in overarming the planet.203.	For there to be disarmament  not only nuclear weapons but also conventional weapons must be included.204.	Disarmament must be genuine  that is  it must produce a significant reduction in the level of weapons  both quantitatively and qualitatively  and must begin first with those countries whose arsenals pose the gravest threat in our world and are out of all proportion either with those of other Powers or with what is needed for world strategic balance.205.	It must be general and complete; that is  it must not allow for discrimination in favour of any one State  geographic area or type of weapon.206.	It must be gradual and balanced; that is  it must be carried out under the same safety conditions for all parties and must help reduce factors of instability.207.	It must also comprise effective measures of control and verification. It is essential in this respect for the United Nations to be able to take a real part in this task  without which no progress can be made. In fact  there can be no disarmament without trust  and no trust without control  and no control unless it is independent  that is to say  international.208.	How should these necessarily very general principles be applied?209.	We will obviously have to discuss this in detail at the special session of the Assembly in May 1978. It is difficult to separate questions of procedure from questions of substance. We will therefore of necessity have to ascertain which forums are best suited to deal with the matter of disarmament. It-is not the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. All of us here are familiar with the limitations on the work that can be accomplished there. The reasons for this are well known. I will not go over them again.210.	When the time comes  France will present its proposals on all these questions with a view to the discussions of the special session of the Assembly. As the President of the French Republic said on 24 August  the overarmament of the world  requires urgent and resolute action . The United Nations community in its entirety must come to grips with this problem.211.	I said a moment ago that the world situation was neither good nor reassuring. There was probably little need to give examples; how many of us can say that we feel safe from the scourges of economic crisis  hunger and war? In this difficult world  no one is spared.212.	It is also up to us to see that man is the ultimate beneficiary of all our action and that human rights are better respected. France  which has given asylum to nearly 100 000 political refugees  was one of the first nations to believe in the need to proclaim human rights. We are soon to ratify the covenants solemnly adopted on this subject by the international community. We cannot help being disturbed at seeing so many Governments retreat behind emergency legislation  establish unequal systems  or practise oppression of entire peoples. No injustice will bring us any closer to the goals of our Charter  which will remain a dead letter unless all our Members agree to move forward within the law.213.	Interdependence is a fact in our international society  but it can also be the bas>s for great undertakings which  if mankind stands together  will lead us to greater freedom  dignity and well-being.214.	This  must be the ambition of each of our Governments  for we know full well that our collective institutions  the principles to which we have all adhered by being here  and the noble goals which we set for our meetings and conferences  ultimately depend on the determination of sovereign States.214. The lessons of history and loyalty to its principles have led France  while exercising its independence  to propose two important concepts for our times: detente and dialogue. One describes the relations which should be fostered between the East and the West; the other suggests fruitful negotiations between the industrialized North and the developing South. Both fall within the framework of the collective effort that brings us together and corresponds to the legitimate expectations of our peoples. France will bring to this effort all the wealth of its creativity and determination."
"47",2519,"GBR",32,1977,"﻿97.	First  Mr. President  I should like to offer you my congratulations on your election. The United Kingdom delegation looks forward to working under a President so experienced in the work of the United Nations.98.	I should like also to extend a welcome to the two new Members of this Assembly  Djibouti and Viet Nam.99.	The constant struggle to close the gap between aspiration and performance in the United Nations was described 22 years ago by the then Secretary-General as making the difference between civilization and chaos. Today  this gap between aspiration and performance remains and the danger of chaos is ever present.100.	The United Nations has from its inception championed all the most fundamental human rights: the right to live without hunger or disease  in peace  free from conflict and the fear of nuclear or any other kind of war.101.	Appalling and well-documented events naturally focus great attention world wide on the abuse or absence of political  civil and legal rights; and on violations and degradations of the integrity of the person  though the sense of outrage over Chile and Uganda  to take but two examples  has not yet been matched by effective international action. But the global challenge of chronic poverty  malnutrition and disease ensures that we cannot escape our responsibility for economic and social rights.102.	Between 1952 and 1972 the gross product of the advanced industrialized nations increased by $1.82 trillion. The aggregate product of the under-developed world in 1972 was less than a third of this increase. This statistic is shocking enough. The reality behind it is even more so. It is generally agreed that more than 400 million people have an insufficient protein supply. About 70 million of them are immediately threatened by starvation. In some of the very poorest countries there is a 50 per cent infant mortality rate  and the development of people's brains is literally stunted by protein and calorie insufficiencies. Most of the world's poor only have access to unsafe water. They are  therefore  chronically vulnerable to schistosomiasis  and to filariasis  the leading cause of blindness. In some areas of conflict the disruption of basic social and medical services poses a challenge to world health. We risk a recrudescence of smallpox in the Horn of Africa and a re-emergence of the tsetse fly in east and southern Africa.103.	The human needs of the developing world are an inescapable challenge to us all and a central element in any foreign policy based on human rights.104.	To establish a fairer and more rational international economic order  both developed and developing nations must work together as equal partners. The dialogue  if it is to be successful  must be seen as a long-term sequence of negotiations on specific issues. The Governments of the industrialized democracies are at present under tremendous domestic political pressures to reduce rapidly high rates of unemployment. We need a greater frankness and realism in the dialogue. The present world recession has hit both developed and developing nations. The developing nations will easily become cynical and despairing if the developed world's actions run counter to its rhetoric. Those of us who represent the industrialized democracies are not entitled to use our economic difficulties as an excuse for abdicating from the dialogue. We must all try to ensure that we develop a long-term strategy which is credible and corrects the effects of some of the short-term decisions which we may feel compelled to take. If we continue into the future the present allocation of resources  we will only perpetuate the existing imbalance between the developed and the developing world.105.	One of the benefits we all derived from the work we did together at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation was a realization of the crucial role that collaboration with regard to energy must play for all sectors of the world economy. It is for this reason that I warmly welcome the Secretary-General's recent proposals for some institutional development within the United Nations framework for the discussion of energy. Its exact form will have to be discussed further—whether an institute  as the Secretary-General has suggested  a new agency  or some other body.106.	The United Nations is rightly devoting a high priority—nearly 40 per cent of its net regular budget-to economic and social activities. Britain  in addition to its own European Community aid programmes  contributed in 1976 some $85 million to the United Nations work in the economic and social field.107.	In my judgment  despite the immense problems which still face us  in the crucial areas of poverty  hunger and disease  the United Nations has shown itself to be an effective and practical instrument. The institutions of the United Nations have also made a major technical contribution towards a more orderly international environment in  for instance  the fields of labour relations  posts and telecommunications  shipping and civil aviation.108.	But in reducing conflict in the world  in achieving peace and in restraining the armaments race  the United Nations cannot claim that its performance has anywhere near matched its aspirations. It is worth examining the distribution of the total financial effort of the United Nations.109.	The United Nations here in New York  together with the all-important autonomous agencies  spent last financial year some $2 200 million. Of the total United Nations financial commitment  only 8 per cent went on what can be summarized briefly as political  diplomatic and peacekeeping activities. If words uttered and words written were anything to go by  those activities would occupy a far higher position in our order of priorities than any other United Nations activity. Why do we write and speak so much about this area and yet spend relatively so little on it  for the consequences of conflict are grievous for millions?110.	It is a regrettable fact of life that in institutional terms the maintenance of world security is the most neglected activity within the United Nations. Health  hunger and poverty are issues on which Member nations are prepared to concede an institutional competence and role for the United Nations. But  with few exceptions  security is seen as the preserve of national Governments. We are prepared to see our doctors  agriculturists  sociologists and economists working together and pooling their expertise within a United Nations institutional framework. But we are reluctant to see our generals and our admirals and our strategic thinkers working within such a framework on behalf of world security.111.	We are all familiar with our own national security problems. But there is all too little understanding of each other's security problems  fears and objectives. We are  as an international body  unable to foresee areas of dispute and to act in time to prevent open conflicts from breaking out. We are unable to act speedily to damp down a dispute in its early stages. The United Nations  if it is involved in a conflict  is usually involved late  and with reluctance.112.	The United Nations is the only forum in which the whole international community is represented. It has the right and they duty to be involved in disputes which threaten peace and stability whether on a regional or on a global scale. But to date it has lacked the necessary authority and commitment  which can only be given to it by Member States for a truly effective security role.113.	In the United Nations we are reluctant to make even modest commitments to international security arrangements. But it is also true that the amount of resources devoted to peace-keeping matters is only a fraction of those employed in the United Nations as a whole  and that the role of the United Nations in peace keeping has in the past received far less attention than its deserves both in speeches from this rostrum and in various committees of our Organization. These facts alone highlight the low priority we give to this area of our Organization's activity.114.	Now  the over-all record of the United Nations in the field of world security is one which we should be prepared to analyse critically  particularly now that the cold-war era and confrontation diplomacy are over and when the super-Powers themselves now exchange detailed information on the most sensitive security issue of all  namely  strategic nuclear weapons. What is needed is for the United Nations to stimulate a specialized and constructive dialogue between Governments on every aspect of world security in a way which would improve the ability of the international community to respond quickly and effectively in situations where action by the United Nations is required. If such a dialogue had been in operation today  we would have been far better able to examine some of the detailed security problems which now confront us all in Africa.115.	The present limitations  as well as the value of the United Nations in its peace-keeping role  are clearly demonstrated by the situation in the Middle East and Cyprus where the United Nations has made a massive  sustained  but all too frequently unappreciated  effort over the years to keep the peace.116.	In the Middle East  the world still faces the most serious of all potential conflicts. The recent resurgence of fighting in southern Lebanon is a sad reminder both of the urgency of finding a solution to the Middle East conflict as a whole and of the difficulties which the Lebanese Government faces in restoring peace and security in that country. One might have thought that here was an obvious situation in which the United Nations could and should have played a more prominent role. For a number of reasons  which we understand  this has not so far been the case. Nevertheless  the assistance of the United Nations remains a possibility  should the present effort of those in the region fail to yield the success for which we all hope. The United Nations has been involved diplomatically in the whole question of the Middle East since 1947. Its involvement in security arrangements through UNEF and UNDOF has cost more than $269 million. In the current financial year it will cost $98 million.117.	The United Nations presence in the Middle East has been at times controversial. But in my view there would have been even greater conflict without it.118.	In the debate about occupied territory  security issues are of central importance and of deep and genuine concern. Hitherto nations have tended to equate security solely with the possession of territories. This is no longer the only relevant security factor. Sophisticated electronic devices can now give a military security which nations had hitherto believed could only come from the physical occupation of territory. The monitoring techniques already in place in Sinai have made possible a measure of disengagement and lessened mistrust between Israel and Egypt. Confidence-building measures  in the shape of demilitarized zones  zones of limited forces  surveillance and early warning systems  and microwave links  could all be an essential component in any final settlement. The United Nations has a role to play  either by supervising and operating these devices or  even more importantly  by promoting an informed public debate on the underlying technical security issues. Now  Mr. Simonet  speaking for the nine member countries of the European Community  has set out our views on the main ingredients of a negotiated settlement  and I do not intend to recapitulate those here this afternoon.119.	The danger of United Nations peace-keeping involvement  initially to hold the ring  is that it can become an excuse for political inactivity or a substitute for serious negotiation. In Cyprus  as in the Middle East  the United Nations peace-keeping forces have reduced hostilities and provided time in which serious negotiations could and  in my view  should have taken place. The meetings between the late Archbishop Makarios and Mr. Denktaf  which led to the resumption of the intercommunal talks  appeared to offer the prospect of some progress. The mission undertaken by Mr. Clark Clifford to Cyprus  Greece and Turkey in February and March has also played an important part. But so far the current intercommunal talks have shown sadly little progress  and the situation has  if anything  deteriorated in recent months. The United Nations  in the person of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative Mr. Perez de Cuellar  has acted with tremendous skill between the parties. But the present United Nations commitment in Cyprus cannot be taken for granted. In the last 13 years the existence of UNFICYP has cost Member States  by way of voluntary contributions  some $200 million. Furthermore  UNFICYP is now seriously in deficit to the tune of some $50 million. The United Kingdom has contributed $45 million in men and in logistical support. This year our contingent  numbering 800 men  is the single largest contribution. The United Nations does not enjoy infinite resources  as the Secretary-General's recent appeal for further contributions to UNFICYP made plain.120.	The United Nations cannot therefore in either Cyprus or the Middle East be used indefinitely as a cover for a stalemate in negotiations. It cannot continue to be seen as a refuge of last resort—a permanent crutch for remaining in a state of  no peace  no war . What the United Nations can do is both to establish the political framework within which negotiations between the parties can take place and  through harnessing the initiatives of its Member States and acting as a catalyst for their ideas  to help to provide the impetus needed to break out of the present stalemate.121.	I turn to southern Africa.122.	It has become increasingly clear that only negotiated settlements which are internationally acceptable and which have the full support of the United Nations will end the violence and achieve stable government by majority rule. This is the hope for a future Zimbabwe and Namibia. In considering how Britain could best exercise its responsibilities in Rhodesia the British Government faced up to the fact that Britain alone could not ensure a peaceful transfer to a majority rule. We also recognized that  though the Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ had a legitimate and major interest in the future of Zimbabwe  neither organization had an institutional framework which could help to provide the stable climate and international recognition for free elections.123.	It was equally clear that  while Britain has legal responsibilities—which we do not seek  and have never sought  to evade—some additional catalyst to make the transition from war to peace  from illegality to legality  was necessary for an internationally acceptable settlement.124.	The United Nations is already deeply involved in the problem of Rhodesia through the various sanctions resolutions. So United Nations involvement is not a new issue of principle for the Security Council. It is probably a realistic constraint on the power of initiative of the United Nations that progress in the Security Council is not responsible unless there is a clearly perceived support from the countries of the region in question for the course of action proposed.125.	We believe that the draft resolution which my Government will submit very shortly in the Security Council has such support. The draft resolution will provide for the appointment by the Secretary-General of a representative to enter into discussions with the British Resident Commissioner designate and with all the parties  with a view to establishing in detail the respective roles of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia during the transition to majority rule. The draft resolution will  we believe  provide the necessary basis for the cease-fire negotiations referred to in the documents which were presented to the Security Council on 1 and 8 September. No final settlement can be agreed or brought to the Council until these essential preliminary negotiations are completed.126.	Now  it is a truism that the Organization is only what its Members make of it. It is precisely because the British Government is acutely aware of the paradox of the United Nations role—on the one hand  indispensable in the search for peace  and on the other  limited in what it can achieve on its own initiative-that we have framed proposals for Rhodesia which acknowledge the vital importance of a United Nations role in guaranteeing an impartial and orderly framework for negotiations  arid in helping to supervise fair and free elections.127.	Our proposals also reflect the blunt truth that peace on the ground is unobtainable unless there is first agreement between the parties who are conducting the fighting. The lesson of United Nations involvement in the Congo and in Cyprus is that a peace-keeping force has little chance of doing its job if  around it  rival armed forces are building up their strength and are determined to use it. This is why the five front-line States and OAU have an important role in helping to achieve an independent Zimbabwe. They have supported the liberation forces in their struggle for freedom  but they have always maintained that it is for the people of Zimbabwe to determine who is to be the future president and who should form the government on independence.128.	Over Namibia the five Western members of the Security Council  including my own country  took an initiative. Negotiations are still in progress  so it is hard to be specific  but we are all under no illusions that  without the support of the United Nations  no settlement can be achieved there which will command the support of the international community  end the violence and allow for a majority-rule government to be freely elected.129.	Now  southern Africa  over the next few months and years  will be the focus of growing tensions. There is at the moment a controlled anger among the majority of the population. The risk that this anger will develop into urban violence is considerable. Those of us here in the United Nations who uphold the essentially peaceful values of a pluralist democracy will come under growing challenge to support violent change. But if we cannot become the advocates of violence and at the same time stay true to our beliefs  our responsibility to the world is to show  beyond any shadow of doubt  that change can be brought about by peaceful means  whether we are talking of Rhodesia  Namibia or South Africa. If we turn our backs on the path of peace—a path of peace—a path which still lies open—then once again the barrel of the gun will be seen to wield more power and influence than reason. Peaceful persuasion and pressures can still achieve results. Violence is the last resort. To advocate it alone is to threaten the whole system of values on which the United Nations rests  and which we are all pledged to sustain.130.	These considerations apply with particular force to the situation in South Africa. South Africa will not be allowed to avoid its responsibilities. It sustains and supports the illegal regime in Rhodesia; it has allowed United Nations sanctions to be systematically undermined since 1967. Within South Africa  apartheid is abhorrent to us all.South Africa faces a choice between a democratic and orderly evolution and an inevitable descent into bloodshed and violence. The choice which South Africa makes may present a challenge to all of us  as Members of the United Nations. Rhodesia is not just an issue for Britain or for the United States  whose support has been so important to my country; it is not just an issue for the freedom fighters  the nationalist leaders  the front-line Presidents  OAU: it is an issue for us all.131.	Over southern Africa the world community and individual Member States may have some awesome and difficult choices in the next few months. These issues cannot be treated with anything other than the utmost seriousness. Certainly  if the negotiations over Rhodesia produced a settlement which the Security Council could endorse  the world would not allow South Africa to continue  in the face of such a settlement  to sustain an obdurate illegal regime in Rhodesia  were it to refuse to give up power.132.	As a world community we are  over South Africa  attempting to change human behaviour  to turn a State away from institutionalized racialism. It will not be achieved overnight  but it must be achieved  Without a serious programme of reform inside South Africa the oppressed majority will have no hope. The tough code of conduct recently adopted by the European Community for its companies operating in South Africa demonstrates  by attacking racialism at the place of work  one form of positive action which I hope others will also adopt. It is but one of the pressures for continuing change which it is vital we espouse if peaceful change is to  be successful.133.	Anxiety over the proliferation of nuclear weapons also lurks in the background. It is in the interests of us all that South Africa should sign the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [see resolution 2373(XXII)l and agree to international inspection of all its nuclear installations. A State which feels itself under attack may  regardless of logic or long-term interest  seek to acquire nuclear weapons as an act of desperation. Desperation is the crucible of violence.134.	My Government  traditionally active in seeking disarmament and promoting the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  is engaged in various negotiations. I am particularly glad that the United States  the Soviet Union and my country are now actively negotiating about a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. This achievement has eluded the world for too long. A comprehensive nuclear test-ban would have a profound effect in limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The development of a specialized dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States on strategic nuclear weapons and the signing of the first agreement concluded as a result of the Strategic Arms limitation Talks [SALT] was a major step. We all hope that the present negotiations will be successful. It would have been inconceivable  even 10 years ago  that military and scientific personnel from these two countries would share such detailed and highly-classified information about their own national security. We need now to widen and build on this important dialogue.135.	World security involves more than conflict situations. It is intimately associated with the search for practical and realizable measures of disarmament. All Member States aspire to the objective of total disarmament  but the relentless increase in most Member States' armament budgets shows how far performance falls short of aspiration.136.	In the more general field of disarmament  we welcome next year's special session of the General Assembly. It will directly engage the international community and the United Nations in what must be a world effort to promote disarmament and check nuclear proliferation. While certain important disarmament negotiations  such as SALT  are necessarily the subject of a bilateral or restricted dialogue  it is vital that the international community and the United Nations in particular should not be excluded from the disarmament effort. It would perhaps have been easier to secure more accessions by now to the non-proliferation Treaty had the international community as a whole  as opposed to a small group of major nuclear Powers  been more closely involved in drawing up its provisions at the start. It means  however  that if the United Nations is to be involved meaningfully it must move from just passing resolutions to the intricacies and the detail of complex scientific negotiations. It will need to develop and expertise that can work in the interests of all the Member States.137.	The search for peace  the promotion of human rights and individual freedom  the elimination of poverty and want in all its forms—these are formidable but inescapable challenges. To meet them our performance will have to move closer to our aspirations. To succeed in this endeavour we must make  in the recent words of the Secretary- General   a conscious effort to develop more positive attitudes to the work of the United Nations both among ourselves and in the outside world. In Britain  support for the United Nations is a corner-stone of our foreign policy. We for our part are resolute in our determination to help make the United Nations a more effective instrument for world peace and co-operation. "
"48",2590,"GHA",32,1977,"﻿88.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Chairman and the Government of the Supreme Military Council of Ghana I must first of all congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. This session has come at a critical time in the history of the United  Nations  when the strength and purpose of our Organization will be tested  particularly in the next few weeks. But we have no doubt that the diplomatic skill  competence and tact which have characterized your distinguished career in the service of your country will be employed in conducting the affairs of this Assembly. By 'this election the international community represented .here not only gives recognition to your personal merit but also does honour to your country and its great leader  Marshal Tito. As you are aware  we in Ghana have for many years enjoyed cordial relations with Yugoslavia and have always held its leader in the highest esteem as a founding member and mentor of the non-aligned movement. Marshal Tito's singular association with this movement is well known. If the concept of non-alignment has today secured international recognition and respect  we in Ghana believe  as indeed many others have confirmed  that this is due in large measure to his conviction  interest and perseverance. The election of Yugoslavia to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session undoubtedly gives recognition to this fact and in a way reflects honour on the non-aligned world in general.89.	I also join previous speakers in expressing to Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe the Ghanaian Government's deep appreciation of his excellent and devoted service to the United Nations General Assembly throughout the past year. Our gratitude also goes to the indefatigable Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and his staff  who in various capacities in the past year have served the interest of humanity with sincerity and dedication.90.	It is indeed a happy event that at the current session we welcome the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti to membership in our Organization.91.	On the happy occasion of the admission of Viet Nam  therefore  the delegation of Ghana salutes its Government and people. Ghana has no doubt whatsoever that in assuming its rightful place in the United Nations the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will make an invaluable contribution to the Organization's understanding of third- world aspirations as well as to the promotion of peace and stability in the world. The Government and people of Ghana look forward to most fruitful and lasting cooperation with the Vietnamese people and Government.92.	Similarly  the admission of Djibouti to the United Nations gives particular satisfaction to the Government and people of Ghana  for it sets the seal on what has been the latest triumph of the liberation movement in Africa.93.	It was only in March this year that the Government of the Supreme Military Council of Ghana played host in Accra to a round-table conference on Djibouti sponsored by the OAU—an event that brought the various leaders of the then colonial Territory together in preparation for independence from France. My personal knowledge of and association with the tremendous difficulties involved in the final stages of the negotiations in Accra make our joy at the admission of Djibouti all the more sincere. It is with all sincerity that I express in the name of the Government of Ghana the hope that the independence won by Djibouti will continue to be jealously guarded by all parties concerned. We are happy that for Djibouti there will now be added to the safeguards of OAU membership the invaluable protection of the United Nations Charter.94.	Our struggle against colonial domination  racism and racial bigotry in southern Africa still rages and political events in that part of our continent since the thirty-first session of the General Assembly make us all the more convinced that our cause is just. We have proclaimed in the past and wish to reiterate today our total rejection of apartheid and other forms of colonialism and racial inequality. Our uncompromising stand against these socio-political evils is made not because we are black  for justice and equality are not denied only to the black race  but because the practice of these evils constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.95.	It is precisely because of this threat to peace that any constructive initiatives aimed at peaceful solutions in the  region would be welcome. At the same time  until there is a guarantee of the success of these initiatives  we will continue to support the armed struggle against apartheid  colonialism and racial oppression as the surest means of achieving victory over forces that have for too long deprived our people of their legitimate rights.96.	The situation in Zimbabwe has recently taken on a new dimension  through the publication of the British proposals for a rapid transition to independence and majority rule in the Territory. Even though we have reserved our position on certain aspects of the proposals  we in Ghana have no intention of obstructing the Anglo- American initiatives. We are compelled  however  to remind the British Government of the grave resp9nsibility that it bears for the complete decolonization of Zimbabwe.97.	It is our hope that the Territory will see a smooth transition to freedom and independence without being subjected to such a reign of terror and anarchy as characterized the birth of the independent Congo in the 1960s. Should any such degeneration set in  Ghana will give its fullest support to the United Nations Security Council in taking firm action  including action under Article 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter  to ensure that the Territory becomes independent on the basis of majority rule.98.	On the question of Namibia  our stand is equally firm. As we are all aware  the decisions taken by the United Nations on the Territory and the advice given to Vorster have throughout the years been scorned by the South African regime. Today  the plight of the Namibian people is no better than it was a year ago when this Assembly last discussed the problem. We are thus compelled to declare that  in spite of the initiatives of the West to find a lasting solution to the situation in Namibia  we will continue to give SWAPO our fullest support in its fight against the South African administration until we are convinced that majority rule is guaranteed for the people of the Territory.99.	Since the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  the world has been gravely disturbed by the developments  as publicized in the press  concerning the nuclear programme of South Africa It is indeed ironical that while the international community is concerned about the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons that threatens our security and civilization  some of the States Members of our Organization should place their knowledge and personnel at the disposal of South Africa to develop a nuclear capability. This is indeed a terrifying prospect about which we cannot remain silent or condone. We are compelled by this development to raise our voice in utter condemnation of those Western Powers which  through this collaboration  have helped place the security of the African continent in serious jeopardy.100.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  the United Nations has sponsored two very important meetings on southern Africa. I refer  of course  to the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo in May 1977  and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  which took place in Lagos in August 1977. In particular  the Maputo Declaration and its Programme of Action contain significant recommendations  to which we call the General Assembly's special attention  on the international community's moral and legal duty to correct the political injustices and racial inequalities prevailing in southern Africa.101.	Secondly  the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos recently  adopted a Declaration which might serve as our charter for the final onslaught on apartheid. In addition  the same Conference made recommendations to the international community as to how this system could be eliminated. The Ghana delegation wishes to reiterate its acceptance of the Declaration and pledges support for the recommendations. We would have preferred them to go further than they do  but we accept the resulting consensus as a point of departure  and hope that the reservations made on it by some Western Powers will be withdrawn in good time. We are prepared in the meantime to work hand in hand with all countries on the basis of the two documents for the total eradication of apartheid and political subjugation. Let us hope that this session will advance the anti-apartheid cause beyond the position so far achieved in these documents.102.	As far as South Africa itself is concerned  nothing significant has occurred in the last 12 months to alter our resolve against the apartheid system and all its related injustices. On the contrary  we salute the black majority  particularly the schoolchildren of Soweto  whose determined efforts have testified eloquently to the non- acceptability  to them and to mankind  of the Fascist rule of the majority by a racist minority103.	In this regard  the proposed constitutional changes recently announced by the Republic deserve the close and serious attention of this Assembly In our view  the move to continue to exclude the black majority from parliament  even though some representation will be accorded the Coloured population  is one more subterfuge of the South African administration to further enslave the black majority politically and economically. Little wonder then that even the Coloureds have rejected the proposal. We feel morally bound to denounce the so-called constitutional proposals. We therefore call upon this Assembly to deliver the moral verdict of our common conscience.104.	It is indeed a matter of happy coincidence for my delegation that our statement in this Assembly should fall on the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners. On behalf of the Government of Ghana  and on my own behalf  therefore  I wish to convey our warmest felicitations to the struggling people of South Africa on the occasion of this anniversary. Even though the fight against apartheid and minority rule has entered a crucial phase  we in Ghana are not daunted. We share with our brothers and sisters today the hope that our cause will be victorious over those of racism and racial discrimination.105.	At this stage  permit me to pay the Ghana delegation's tribute to the memory of our comrade and brother  Steven Biko  who was foully murdered only a few weeks ago by the security forces of the Vorster regime. The death of comrade Biko should serve as a grim reminder to all those involved in the fight against apartheid and racial injustice that the struggle is still at a critical stage and that the enemy will continue to be more and more ruthless as our struggle achieves success. To Steven Biko's family and comrades we offer our sincerest condolences in the hope that his death will not be in vain  for victory will surely crown their relentless efforts.106.	I cannot end my remarks on Africa without touching briefly on the unfortunate war which has been raging with growing ferocity in the Horn of Africa. Attempts by the OAU to settle the conflict through peaceful negotiations proceed with determination. But my delegation regrets that success has not attended the efforts of the OAU. It is an accepted historical fact that the present African frontiers were drawn by the colonial Powers  almost a century ago  with scant regard for ethnic and other relevant considerations. African frontiers have always  therefore  constituted potential sources of conflicts between one country and another. It was in order to bury for ever such inherent dangers that the founding fathers of the OAU in their wisdom adopted  as an essential element in the Charter of their organization  the principle of the inviolability of frontiers  by which the boundaries inherited from colonialism were to be accepted without question by the successor States. For it should be fairly obvious that  if one were to proceed to a general modification of African frontiers in response to the dictates of ethnicity and other reasons  there would be no end to friction between African countries. It is our hope  therefore  that all the parties involved in the present conflict will cease their fire and talk  so that the scant resources of the area can be channelled to the economic and social advantage of their peoples.107.	Furthermore  we Africans in particular should realize that the situation existing in the Horn of Africa has unfortunately created a fertile ground for super-Power rivalry in that region. It is  however  the African countries concerned who  in the final analysis  will have to pay the price for such rivalry. It is therefore vitally important for the peaceful development of our continent that the two super-Powers  which have agreed to observe the principle of detente in their mutual relations and with regard to questions of European co-operation and security  should not depart from that principle when the issue relates to Africa. For  to be valid  a principle should lend itself to general application in comparable circumstances. What is good for Europe's peace is also good for the peace and stability of Africa.108.	As we look around us  in Africa  Europe  the Middle East and Asia  we see tension and conflict engulfing mankind and threatening to negate the principles upon which our Charter stands. Month after month  and year after year  global peace and security have proved illusory and we  especially in the third world  have become helpless witnesses to a world severely divided by ideologies and rendered unsafe by the stockpiling of the most destructive and efficient nuclear weapons. It is in such an uncertain world that Ghana  true to the tenets of its foreign policy  has placed implicit faith in detente.109.	Admittedly  there has been a thawing in the cold war in Europe and the major Powers are no longer plagued by the siege complex that characterized the 1950s and 1960s. However  the arms race continues  and the competition to gain international influence  particularly in Africa  is keen. Our territories have thus become the jousting ground for power and ideological conflict  in the mistaken belief that the third world desperately needs the political patronage of one or the other of the two major ideologies to survive. Nothing can be further from the truth. Africa today has only one wish and that is to be left alone to develop its economic and social potential.110.	For these reasons  we have a deep commitment to detente not only in Europe but throughout the world. It must be understood  therefore  that what the world needs now is not ideological bickering and neo-colonialist influence but the development of responsible relationships between nations  which alone can guarantee us all security from conflict and catastrophe. We again call on the major Powers to continue relentlessly to pursue detente so we can all live in a world that is free from fear and motivated only by the will to provide the best for mankind in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.111.	Another area of crucial importance to peace and stability in the world is the Middle East. It is true that the situation in that region has seen some improvement  especially since the signing and coming into force in 1976 of the second Israeli-Egyptian disengagement agreement. However  within the intervening period there has been the civil war in Lebanon  which proved singularly destructive. In spite of the heavy toll claimed by that unfortunate war  we are encouraged to note the strenuous efforts made to contain the war and to prevent it from engulfing the other countries in the region. The need  however  to move faster towards a permanent peace settlement in the Middle East is perhaps greater today than at any other period in recent times. We in Ghana have always maintained  and still maintain  that the self-determination of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab occupied territories are indispensable conditions to any lasting peace.112.	The Government of Ghana considers that the United Nations has a sacred responsibility in helping to establish a national home in Palestine for the largely dispersed Palestinians  in the same way as it accepted and endorsed the creation of Israel in 1948. The justice of the intense struggle for freedom in which the Palestinian people have been engaged has been accepted by the international community and due recognition should be taken of this fact in determining the eligibility of the Palestine Liberation Organization to represent the Palestinian people at the proposed Peace Conference on the Middle East to be held in Geneva. The new Israeli regime should therefore take into account the long-term interests of Israel  and not let slip the opportunity for restarting the process towards the achievement of permanent peace.113.	Before I touch briefly on the current situation in Cyprus  please permit me on behalf of my delegation  to express to the Government and people of Cyprus the shock and pain with which the Government and people of Ghana received the sad news of the death of His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios. It was only last June that we met in London on the occasion of the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government. Archbishop Makarios' clear exposition of the Cyprus problem  as well as other contributions to the success of the summit meeting  was much appreciated by his colleagues. To his successor  Mr. Spyros Kyprianou  who has no doubt inherited a grave political burden  go our best wishes for the happy future of that beautiful but troubled island.114.	It is a matter of deep regret for my delegation that practically no progress has been made on the Cyprus problem since the thirty-first session. For the Cypriots  each passing day is a painful experience in their present predicament. In various resolutions on the Cyprus issue  both the General Assembly and the Security Council have stressed the importance they attach to the sovereign independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. The United Nations has also called for the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the island and the resumption of the intercommunal talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. None of these objectives has been attained in Cyprus  and there is still no encouraging sign that a just solution will be found in the foreseeable future.115.	Ghana is  in principle  opposed to any invasion of sovereign States and therefore recognizes only one sovereign State of Cyprus. It is in the over-all interest of all parties -that the conflict should be resolved through discussions and negotiations rather than by military confrontation. The Ghana Government would therefore lend its support to efforts tending towards such a solution  including measures decided upon by this Assembly to ease the humanitarian problems created by the war.116.	If the general political situation in the world is characterized by widespread dissensions and grave injustices  which are largely the result of man's own making  the area of international economic co-operation to which I now wish to turn my attention has not been spared the ravages peculiar to our time. Since the events of October 1973  economic co-operation among States has never been the same. The general recession that occurred essentially in the developed market economies of the world and the unprecedented hardship that was visited upon non-oil- producing developing countries underscored the importance of taking urgent and effective measures to reverse the downward economic trend It was indeed generally conceded that the Bretton Woods system  set up more than 30 years ago  could no longer meet the needs and growing aspirations of poor countries  and could therefore no longer be tolerated without further hardship to those countries. At its sixth special session  the General Assembly addressed itself to the problem inherent in the restructuring of the system and adopted its Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. The General Assembly at the seventh special session  despite the reservations expressed by some States  was able to indicate the steps by which the objectives of the Declaration were to be attained. Three whole years have passed since the adoption of those texts  and the world has hardly been brought any nearer to the actual realization of the goals that we had solemnly set before us.117.	It therefore appears that the movement towards a basic reform of the international economic system has lost the momentum generated in 1974. On the other hand  the persistent deterioration in the situation of the developing countries  including the terms of international trade  has reached a level that is not far from desperate. There is thus a pressing need to remind ourselves that the objectives of promoting peace and security in the world  to which the United Nations is committed  cannot be achieved without a restructuring of the present international economic system so as to achieve a more rational and equitable set of relationships between the developed and the developing countries. An essential element in this restructuring would be a comprehensive series of commodity agreements to strengthen and stabilize the markets for the principal commodity exports of developing countries. Such agreements should operate to protect agreed minimum prices  in real terms  for those commodities  and should be supported by a substantial improvement in the terms and scope of existing compensatory financing arrangements so as to offset residual fluctuations in real export earnings of individual developing countries. Of crucial importance in this context is the common fund. While the understandings reached at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation have given considerable impetus to the negotiations on this issue  it is the hope of my Government that the forthcoming negotiating conference will move away from the debate on whether or not the fund should be established and come to grips with the question of the character and modalities of the fund.118.	The restructuring of the international economic framework should also encompass policy changes on the part of the developed countries that would support the process of industrialization and the technological development of the developing countries. These policy reorientations should include adjustment assistance policies  substantial reductions in trade barriers to the manufactured exports of developing countries  and the strengthening of the technological capabilities of the developing countries. Furthermore  the process of restructuring would not be fully effective without a thorough reform of the international monetary system as well as of the rules governing trade flows. There must be a substantial increase in the volume of official development assistance on terms and conditions that are more appropriate than those applied hitherto to the weak economic position of the majority of the developing countries. At the same time  the growing external indebtedness of the developing countries requires more urgent attention than ever before. Finally  the efforts of the individual developing countries to pursue this economic development on the basis of self-reliance-a concept to which my Government attaches great importance-would be very greatly strengthened by ever closer economic co-operation among ourselves. We  the developing countries  cannot afford to neglect this type of cooperation if we are fully to exploit the complementarities of our various economies and  above all  if we are to enlarge our collective countervailing power in our negotiations and economic relations with the developed countries.119.	Another area where the need for reform has become urgent is constituted by the regime regulating the use of the sea. New problems arising from the technological and economic developments over the last decade have increased the need for a comprehensive international agreement concerning the question of jurisdiction related to the sea and the sea-bed. Ghana has participated actively in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea since 1973. Our support for the convening of the Conference was due partly to the fact that previous conferences on the law of the sea left unresolved some main issues  like the limits of territorial waters  while other important issues were either left open or not even considered. More disturbing is the fact that the conventions that resulted from the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held in Geneva in 1958 has not  to any extent  been subscribed to by the many developing countries that achieved independence subsequent to the conclusion of that Conference.120.0. These are but a few of the considerations that led many of us to support the continuation of the negotiations notwithstanding the heavy financial burden incurred by many countries  especially developing ones  in servicing the Conference. The sixth session of the Conference ended barely three months ago here in New York. Its principal result is the agreement  to bring together in one document the draft articles relating to the entire range of subjects before the Conference. The text shows that significant progress has been made on vital issues relating to international security  navigation  pollution  the transfer of technology  scientific research and the setting up of an international regime for the conduct of sea-bed mining. In spite of certain reservations here and there  the composite text embodies the principal elements of the future convention on the law of the sea.121.	My delegation hopes that the necessary political will to bring the Conference to a successful conclusion will not fail to assert itself.122.	It is the sincere belief of my delegation that this year's session of the General Assembly will witness substantial progress in man's continued search for greater justice  freedom and equality. The United Nations was created in order to help to achieve these objectives and to promote peace and solidarity among nations. The difficult problems confronting the international community are the problems of southern Africa and the Middle East-and the efforts to install a new economic order are among the most serious challenges of our time. Their solution will not be easy. But whether the United Nations can continue to justify the trust and confidence that millions of people have placed in the world body will depend largely on the collective and sincere contribution of Member States and the fervour with which they are prepared to carry out their obligations under the Charter. The Ghana delegation will not be found wanting in this regard. "
"49",2637,"GIN",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  first of all permit me to express to you on behalf of the people of Guinea  its Party-State and its Government  our warm congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.2.	Your country  Sir  Yugoslavia  a country with which the Republic of Guinea has links of friendship and fruitful co-operation  has won the sympathy and the respect of all peoples through its unreserved commitment to democratic and social progress and the defence of peace and security everywhere.3.	Your experience of international affairs  your proved competence in matters of concern to our Organization  your noteworthy career as professor  magistrate  diplomat and statesman augur well for the way in which the discussions of the present session will be conducted.4.	We should like here to convey all our gratitude to Mr. Amerasinghe for the profound political sense which he displayed as he presided over the work of the last session of the General Assembly.5.	May we also tell our very distinguished Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  how much the people of Guinea value his contribution in so skilfully conducting the work of the United Nations in order to bring together people of goodwill throughout the world.6.	The Guinean delegation would like to take this opportunity to address to all the representatives here our sincere wishes for successful work for a better future for the United Nations  whose universality is growing in strength from year to year  notably with the admission to its membership during this session of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.7.	We address our warm congratulations to the people of the Republic of Djibouti  whose experience in the liberation struggle will  we are convinced  make for stability in the Horn of Africa  which is a matter of the gravest anxiety to us all at the present time.8.	Our congratulations are also addressed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which  for 30 years  has valiantly rebuffed  one by one  all foreign aggressions  thus providing proof  if proof were needed  that victory always belongs to those who struggle.9.	The thirty-second session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when thinking people throughout the world are more than ever concerned about sources of tension whose repercussions or consequences are hard to foresee  particularly since imperialism is stubbornly attempting to maintain and to uphold the old order of injustice which for centuries has been imposed upon the oppressed peoples.10.	Thus in Zimbabwe Ian Smith's scorn for democracy represents a challenge to the Charter of the United Nations. But the armed struggle that has thus been imposed on the fraternal people of Zimbabwe by the illegal regime is daily winning new victories  and the Maputo Conference has just marked a decisive stage in' the awareness of the international community  prompting it to give effective support to the liberation movements.11.	At the fourteenth regular session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity   held at Libreville in July  the OAU unanimously pledged to support the Patriotic Front as the only liberation movement in Zimbabwe. This is a clear proclamation for those who sincerely wish to assist us of the solution that has been advocated by all Africa for the Rhodesian problem.12.	Africa  which remains the only continent subject to direct domination  has thus chosen the Patriotic Front as an appropriate instrument to hasten the process of Zimbabwe's liberation.13.	We therefore find it difficult to understand how people outside Africa  for ill-explained or inexplicable reasons  suddenly and rather late in the day find that they are gifted mediators and from various quarters put forward a whole gamut of settlement plans that are designed purely and simply to hold up and to compromise the true liberation of Zimbabwe. This is why every thing must be done by both Africa and Africa's true friends to prevent any attempt to create puppet movements alongside the Patriotic Front. Africa has pronounced itself unambiguously. It is now up to the international community to respect that decision of Africa's and to give its sole support to the Patriotic Front. And if perchance some continue to believe that the best policy is to divide in order to rule they will bear before history the grave responsibility for the nameless violence that would undoubtedly be visited upon that region.14.	In the case of Namibia the United Nations must assume its full responsibility by helping the Namibian people to exercise soon their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence at an early date.15.	We remain convinced that no consultation should be organized in that country without the participation of the South West African People's Organization  the sole representative of the Namibian people. The Republic of Guinea will' never tire of denouncing the underhanded attempts to substitute here  too  some assembly of tribal chiefs who would be nothing more than puppets in the service of imperialism.16.	Furthermore  our delegation denounces South Africa's attempt to annex Walvis Bay  an integral part of Namibia; which is one and indivisible. Therefore  in order to bring peace to Namibia  the Republic of Guinea considers the United Nations must do everything to bring about the liberation of the Namibian patriots illegally detained by Vorster  to ensure the return of the exiles to their country  and to speed up unconditional realization of the legitimate aspirations of the fraternal people of Namibia under the guidance of SWAPO.17.	The Republic of Guinea favours convening a special session of the General Assembly to discuss effectively the problem of Namibia  and it supports the Maputo Declaration on this Territory.18.	As for apartheid  which has been so frequently condemned by the international community  numerous seminars and international meetings have been devoted to it in order to convince the Pretoria regime that an end should be put to its genocide. But the South African racists have so far remained deaf to all appeals to reason. More than that  in June 1970 young students in Soweto fell martyrs to Vorster's barbarity. And quite recently violent confrontations have aroused indignation throughout the world against South Africa  which is vainly attempting to impose its policy of ""bantustanization""  which has already been condemned by our Organization. The further the incorrigible racists go in strengthening their machinery of oppression and repression  the more implacable will be the revolution of liberation. After Soweto  Alexandra and Guguleto  it is now in Johannesburg  Cape Town and Pretoria that the enraged peoples have organized their resistance and are progressively encircling the racist armies in their last strongholds.19.	The people of Guinea  which is a member of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid  recently had an opportunity to reaffirm its position at the World Conference for Action Against Apartheid  held in Lagos from 22 to 27 August 1977.20.	Our delegation firmly upholds the armed struggle of the South African people for its independence even though South Africa is stepping up its military potential and even though the acquisition of the atomic bomb by the fascist regime in Pretoria bears further witness to the flagrant betrayal of the peoples of Africa by international imperialism. Some have told those who care to listen to them that armed struggle cannot solve the problem of  apartheid. But at the same time those advocates of racism—and therefore of the Devil—have delivered to the disciples of apartheid a genocidal weapon  nuclear arms.21.	But the Republic of Guinea has always affirmed through the authoritative voice of its leader President Ahmed Sekou Toure that—and I quote him:""Africa will never yield to nuclear blackmail because the eternal South African people will live for a long time  a very long time  after the followers of apartheid and their allies have been buried together with their sophisticated weapons.""22.	Our delegation would like to reiterate its firm support of the Republic of the Comoros concerning its recovery of the island of Mayotte and earnestly hopes there will be a happy outcome of the actions undertaken for that purpose with the French Government by the current President of the OAU.23.	Speaking of the settlement of various conflicts between African States  the delegation of the Republic of Guinea fully subscribes to the attempts at mediation of the OAU in strict respect for the principles of the Addis Ababa Charter.24.	The Republic of Guinea has always favoured a just and lasting solution of the Palestinian problem in the Middle East. This presupposes recognition of the national rights of that people and restoration of the occupied Arab territories. It is our constant purpose always to defend justice  democracy and peace and that is why we shall always unreservedly support the cause of the martyred Palestinian people.25.	Therefore  for any just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem  the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on an equal footing with all other parties to the conflict is essential  and the Republic of Guinea will fully support the report of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  and here reaffirms its complete solidarity with the Arab peoples.26.	Despite the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions recommending a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus crisis  the talks between the Greek and Turkish communities remain deadlocked and that island continues to be occupied by foreign troops  while at the same time everything is being done to transform it into a NATO military base  which undoubtedly further aggravates the tension so prejudicial to establishing a climate of confidence and peace in that area and throughout the world. That is why our delegation is in favour of the unity of the Cypriot people and the safeguarding of the island's territorial integrity.27.	The continued presence of foreign military bases in the islands scattered over the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean is a source of concern to the international community. General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  which has frequently been recalled and reaffirmed both in the United Nations and in other international bodies  does not seem to have gone further than a simple definition of the goal of making the Indian Ocean a ""zone of peace"". The situation in that region  fraught as it is with dangerous tension  requires the effective implementation of that resolution.28.	Faithful to the position taken by the non-aligned countries  the Republic of Guinea reaffirms its adherence to the principles of that resolution and reiterates its active solidarity with the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean  the islands of which  from East to West  ring the continental areas of Asia and East Africa and  therefore  constitute a zone of strategic significance to the security of both these continents.29.	In East Timor  foreign invading forces still occupy the country  despite the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council calling for their withdrawal and for all States to respect the territorial integrity of East Timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination and independence.30.	The Republic of Guinea  which has already recognized East Timor as an independent  sovereign State  reiterates here its unwavering support for the people of Timor in its legitimate struggle to regain its independence and territorial integrity under the leadership of FRETILIN.31.	Another major source of concern to the international community continues to be Korea  whose people is still divided between the North and the South. The delegation of the Party-State of Guinea supports the efforts already under way to bring about the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea  free from foreign interference.32.	The Republic of Guinea welcomes the recent agreements reached on the Panama Canal and  since we consider that they make for peace and equilibrium throughout the world  earnestly hopes they will be ratified by both parties as soon as possible.33.	In the case of Belize  once again we would voice our heartfelt wish that the negotiations to which the various interested parties have been invited will yield positive results based on the principle of recognition of and respect for the right of the people of Belize to self-determination and independence in order to promote peaceful coexistence both in the Central American isthmus and throughout the region.34.	It is also our hope that the same principle will be applied in the case of the Islas Malvinas and that the right of the people of that Territory to self-determination will be both recognized and respected.35.	The Republic of Guinea once again reaffirms its active solidarity with the Chilean resistance movement-a movement fully in conformity with the legitimate struggle of the Chilean people for the restoration of legality  justice and democracy in that country.36.	The people of Guinea  faithful to the principles of its Party-State  wishes to assure all struggling people of those subjugated countries of its militant support and total sympathy in their efforts to bring to full fruition the ideals of the United Nations  whose efforts in this area  unfortunately leave something to be desired.37.	Indeed  after 32 years of existence  during which nearly a hundred new independent and sovereign States have been created  fundamental adjustments in the United Nations Charter have become more necessary than ever if we really desire to reflect both the breadth and the nature of the changes that have occurred. It has been proclaimed that all nations are equal in the United Nations. However  in reality  the African nations are far from having achieved all those acknowledged rights. And  as President Ahmed Sekou Toure has emphasized ""Africa alone is not among the permanent members of the Security Council enjoying the right of veto. For some time now  and for too long  we have called for the abolition of the right of veto; that has not come about. It would now be quite natural for an African State also to be a permanent member of the Security Council. That country would  on behalf of the African continent  exercise the right of veto in order to preserve the higher interests of Africa.""It is extremely regrettable that Africa's wish has not been met.38.	That is why our delegation wishes to echo OAU resolution which calls upon all States Members of the United Nations to work for the elimination of the iniquitous right of veto in order to ensure respect for the principle of the equality of all States Members of the United Nations; because  as the Guinean Chief of State has declared: ""The United Nations ispractising apartheid in the Security Council."" 39.	Injustice in international relations must not go on indefinitely. The realization of the legitimate aspirations of our peoples will surely contribute to the building of a new world based on solidarity  social justice and democratic progress.40.	Peace and security remain the concern of all peoples; hence the Republic of Guinea once again declares that disarmament is a matter of concern to all our States. Hence  we unreservedly support the initiative to convene  in May 1978  a special session of the Assembly which will constitute a step towards the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. But any logical disarmament must necessarily be based on respect for the desire of peoples to rid themselves of imperialist domination. This of necessity implies the elimination of any subordinate relationships  the abolition of colonialism and exploitation  and the building of a just economic order.41.	Hence  any measures taken to bring about detente and co-operation in Europe and in America can be effective only if they are applied to the other continents. Unfortunately  we see that  more and more  imperialism is fanning hot-beds of tension in Africa  the Middle East and in the Indian Ocean.42.	It was the thirty-first session of the General Assembly which decided to create an Ad Hoc Committee for the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  charged with the task of drawing up a legal instrument to prevent and outlaw acts of terrorism.43.	Indeed  violence and international terrorism have in recent years taken on alarming proportions and now pose a threat to international order.44.	However  it is easy to see that  like international terrorism  the taking of hostages is but a consequence of much more important problems  which are  inter alia  the disparities existing between the developed and the developing countries; the colonialism that still prevails in Southern Rhodesia  in Namibia  in South Africa and elsewhere; the inhuman policy of apartheid'  the explosive situation in the Middle East; and out-and-out acts of aggression.45.	Some feel that international terrorism and the taking of hostages can be stopped without their underlying causes being determined and properly dealt with. But does anyone believe that a tree can be destroyed by plucking off its leaves? If the roots of the tree are removed  however  it will undoubtedly die. In other words  in order to resolve the question of the taking of hostages  one must view it within the context of international terrorism.46.	In southern Africa  where the subjugated peoples are terrorized  the occupied countries have become huge prisons. Who could then condemn the nationalists of Zimbabwe  of Namibia or of South Africa if tomorrow they were to take hostage their enemies Ian Smith. Who could condemn a State that has regularly been the victim of aggression on the part of the racist regimes if  one day  it should seize some of those in authority in the illegal regimes  the servile instruments of imperialism?47.	Indeed  when Smith usurps power  commits aggression  shifts innocent populations around and places them in concentration camps  it is apparently normal behaviour for Smith and his allies. Now  in point of fact this is nothing else but State terrorism.48.	When Vorster illegally occupies Namibia and thus takes hostage an entire people which he exploits and humiliates  for Vorster and his allies that is normal behaviour. But as soon as a handful of European tourists are taken hostage  international imperialism hastens to sound the alarm.49.	In other words  the Republic of Guinea will never be content with a simplistic and selfish solution of this problem  which is so rightly of concern to our community. It is for that reason that the Guinean delegation considers that any international convention on the matter must take due account of certain important considerations which are as follows: first  the legitimacy of the struggle of liberation movements and of the inalienable right of freedom fighters to take up arms to fight against their oppressor must be recognized; secondly  the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States must be respected; and  thirdly  there must be no use or threat of force against liberation movements since they are considered to be acting in self-defence.50.	The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was more productive than the previous ones.51.	For the Republic of Guinea  the common heritage of mankind represented by the resources of the sea bed and ocean floor should be exploited to the benefit of all peoples. The United Nations has the duty to preserve and to guarantee the share of the colonized peoples who are not yet participating in the discussions being held on this problem. The redistribution of all the benefits being reaped in the area must be planned by a strong and impartial international authority.52.	My delegation prefers the unitary system to the parallel system that has been advocated by the industrialized States and whose acceptance would only create a permanent source of frustration for the young nations. For us  the sovereignty of the coastal States over their territorial waters should be subject to no restrictions  and that is why the territorial sea can never be put in the-same category with the high seas.53.	In order that greater justice and equity may be achieved in these matters  it appears urgent to set up an international tribunal on the law of the sea that will be in a position to resolve conflicts that have  unfortunately  become all too numerous  and thus to preserve international peace and security.54.	We consider  furthermore  that scientific research  which cannot be dissociated from the other activities in the economic zone  should be pursued with the full agreement of the coastal States. This principle  which should be stated without any ambiguity  deserves to be carefully borne in mind since it affects the security of States.55.	And it is our fervent hope that  on the basis of the positive results that were achieved at the sixth session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea  the international community will at last be in a position to reach a final agreement at the next session of that Conference  which is to be held in March 1978 in Geneva.56.	After the justifiable hopes that were raised by the various sessions of UNCTAD  the special sessions and the major development strategies elaborated at those sessions  the world is coming little by little to perceive the scarcely disguised refusal to implement the resolutions adopted by our Organization for the establishment of a new international economic order that will be both just and equitable. We are hardly surprised  however  at that systematic refusal on the part of certain developed countries  which  despite pious utterances  are reluctant to assume their full responsibility in this great historic process.57.	The situation changed somewhat between 1973 and 1976  but the development that occurred was  in reality  but a tactic because our countries  being both the suppliers of exports and privileged markets for manufactured goods  remain valid partners with which it is essential to reach agreement in order that a system of economic relations may be evolved that is both stable and serves the welfare of all. However  the industrialized countries had  at all costs  to create the necessary conditions to allow them to remain the masters of the game in the negotiations that were to lead to the creation of this new order. Now  more than ever before  the developing countries consider that simply establishing more equitable and mop balanced relationships between themselves and the industrialized countries is no longer enough to bring about the new system that is so ardently desired by our peoples. And those peoples according to the words of a certain philosopher  wish to participate fully in the ""destruction of what is  their eyes wide open to what is to be "" in their desire to a major part in the working out of a stable international economic order that will be different from the old one in order to emerge from the present crisis and to prevent future crises.58.	The Republic of Guinea  from the start aware of the manoeuvres of the industrialized countries  had expressed reservations regarding the conditions in which the North- South dialogue advocated by the Conference on International Economic Co-operation at Paris was to be initiated  because  by pretending to endorse our claims so as to void them of their essential content  and by preventing a large number of concerned countries from participating in the. discussion  the industrialized countries thought to preserve that position of hegemony guaranteed to them by almost all the advantages that everyone today rejects and repudiates.59.	As was stressed by President Ahmed Sekou Toure  we could only conclude that it had been a failure  because the demands of the developing countries could not be satisfied by a simple refurbishing of the present system of international economic relations.60.	On the contrary  these requirements should be based on human rights—rights which are not limited to narrow  purely juridical considerations designed to lull international opinion but are acquired by genuine  just and equitable negotiation on raw materials and primary commodities  on trade in manufactured goods  on aid and financial transfers  on industrial development  on the new international division of labour  on food problems and the development of agriculture  and on the international monetary system.61.	Only then shall we be able within the international community to tackle wisely the burning and urgent problem of human rights which govern all aspects of our daily activities  in order to bring peace to a changing world  progress  and technological and social revolution of all kinds.62.	The imperialist States  ever anxious to maintain their unfair privileges acquired by violence and crime and to deny our peoples even the most elementary rights laid down in the United Nations Charter—namely  the right of peoples to self-determination  the right of peoples to dispose of their own natural resources  the right of peoples to live in the socio-political regime of their choice—the imperialist States  which cynically and daily flout the fundamental rights of man  are organizing a carefully planned campaign on human rights with the sole purpose of creating a diversion and maintaining in certain developing countries a state of confusion which benefits the manoeuvres of imperialism alone.63.	Was there serious concern for human rights when the slave traders systematically violated those rights in order to accumulate capital so as to bring about the affluent societies of today  the so-called free and prosperous societies? Was there any serious concern for these human rights when almost all the African continent was still languishing under the vile yoke of colonialism? Is there serious concern at the moment about Namibia  in South Africa  when people are calmly supplying nuclear reactors to Vorster? So why these politico-ethical demands to build into a system of international relations and a means of electoral propaganda something which is only a covert way of intervening in the internal affairs of States in order to destabilize progressive regimes  equating them purely and simply  and very maliciously  with Fascist States  which are themselves the products of imperialism?64.	That is the new way in which imperialism is insulting the revolutionary regime!65.	We have heard talk of the ""Guinean ghetto""  but these slanders against the Republic of Guinea will never deflect the people and the Democratic Party of Guinea from the objective they have set themselves-namely  the total liberation of the African continent through the struggle to achieve fully and completely the right of its peoples to self-determination.66.	It is precisely there that the difference between our States and the old Western nations lies. Whereas in the liberal democratic regimes antagonism takes the form of a dichotomy between man and society  the individual and the State  in many developing States society is increasingly given primacy over the individual  who remains of course an inseparable component of the whole.67.	That is why the progressive parties and the democratic States  always anxious to advance  have already enlarged the rights of man and of the individual to extend ""to whole peoples.68.	Obviously this evolution is only possible after the radical changes which were brought about by the revolution in the bourgeois law which was conceived and maintained for many centuries in order to preserve the established order and which  frequently by violent means  called into question the independence so dearly won by the struggle of the peoples.69.	And we well understand that the new slogan of the defence of human rights  in whose name international reaction is embarking on a war against certain countries  is exactly the same battle charger always sent into battle against revolutionary Guinea  which imperialism will never forgive either for its historic choice of 28 September 1958 or for its stubbornness in the defence of the higher interests of Africa.70.	It is not so much a question of defending human rights as of deliberately preparing once more conditions for further aggression against us. It is less a matter of pleading for political prisoners than of seeking to liberate criminals who have been condemned by all international bodies  in order to put them to even viler employment.71.	After the armed aggression against the Republic of Guinea of 22 November 1970  the mercenaries and their accomplices were condemned without right of appeal by the Organization of Senegal River States  the OAU and the Security Council.72.	Thus on 24 November 1970  scarcely 48 hours after the mercenary invasion of Guinea  the Organization of Senegal River States—that is  Senegal  Mauritania  Mali and Guinea—voted unanimously in favour of a resolution requesting: "". .. that an example be made of the mercenaries and their local accomplices"".73.	A few days later the Council of Ministers of the OAU  at its seventh extraordinary session from 9 to 12 December 1970 at Lagos  unanimously adopted a resolution requiring that an example be made of all those who might prepare  encourage  organize and perpetrate aggression against the Republic of Guinea.74.	For its part  the Security Council  after having carried out investigations in Guinea  adopted resolution 290 (1970) which declared that aggression to be a serious threat to world peace and security. The Security Council also said that it was ""grieved at the loss of life and extensive damage caused by the armed attack ..."" on the Republic of Guinea and that it endorsed the concisions in the report of the Special Mission to the Republic of Guinea.75.	According to the conclusions in the report of the Special Mission of the Security Council it became clear that  in order to make us pay for what happened on 22 November 1970  international imperialism has used its normal criminal system against the people-in other words  its specialized agencies of subversion  which had patiently set up a fifth column whose task it was to overturn the Guinean Government and replace it by a puppet regime.76.	It was in the spirit of that clearly expressed will of the African continent and the international Organization that the people of Guinea had to inflict on the aggressors and their accomplices penalties commensurate with their crime  a crime which reached the very heights of the implacable ferocity of international imperialism in its desire to put an end to revolutionary Guinea. Imperialism  so stubborn and so stupid  thought perhaps that we would judge its mercenaries according to its own code  that of the bourgeois law which was conceived by it to serve its own ends. Imperialism perhaps believed that we would call upon advocates and judges who had been trained in its school. Taking note of the sentences of the Organization of Senegal River States  the OAU and the Security Council  the Republic of Guinea went straight to the people  who were the main plaintiff  those who had been attacked  those who had lost hundreds and hundreds of their sons. Among the aggressors  of course  were foreigners  but there were also nationals who were going to be judged by their fathers  mothers  brothers  sisters  whom they had wanted to reduce to slavery for the benefit of international monopolistic capitalism. It was the entire people of Guinea  consulted through their political institutions  trade unions  youth and women  the entire people of Guinea in their homes  workshops and offices  who passed the final sentence through the National Assembly  which was thus turned into a supreme revolutionary tribunal.77.	For the benefit of imperialism  which sometimes understandably has a short memory  we should simply like to recall that the supporters of freedom during the Fascist war of 1939-1945 did not wait for the Nurnberg trials to punish traitors  ""collaborators"" and war criminals.78.	Furthermore  how can one explain that this imperialism—with its hands still stained with the fresh blood of the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos  Democratic Kampuchea  Palestine and Chile  which always lives up to its reputation and  hopefully  would one day redeem its crimes against Africa committed in Madagascar  in Algeria  in Kenya  in Guinea-Bissau  in Mozambique and Angola  which still fights against the inalienable rights of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa and still gives protection to former Nazis  how can one explain that this imperialism  50 per cent of whose labour force is in a state of chronic unemployment  how can one explain that this imperialism can cynically pose as a defender of human rights in Guinea  in Africa and elsewhere? This is completely ridiculous.79.	As far as we are concerned  one cannot speak of human rights without recognizing the rights of peoples. If Europe had the merit of proclaiming human rights  Africa has gone even further and has proclaimed the right of peoples to their existence  education  employment and the sovereign exercise of all their rights  beginning with the right to self-determination and independence.80.	Human rights can be conceived by us only in the context of suppression of man's exploitation of man. In order to bring about a more just social order  the struggle for human rights consists essentially of the following: bringing about the total decolonization of the African continent  engaging in a fiercely anti-imperialist struggle  proceeding to carry out national reconstruction and consolidating genuine economic and cultural independence  helping the brother peoples throughout the world to liberate themselves from the yoke of the imperialist world  and struggling consistently for social and democratic progress  justice and peace throughout the world.81.	In the Republic of Guinea we shall never tire of repeating  as President Ahmed Sekou Toure said  that ""we prefer freedom in poverty to opulence in slavery"". Our acts reflect our affirmations. No better expression could be given to the unconditional attachment of a people to human rights.82.	The fact that those who yesterday still cynically denied us those rights have now suddenly turned into champions of our liberties is something that leaves us puzzled.83.	However  if we look more closely  this rather brusque change barely conceals the Machiavellian intention of imperialism to unleash against our people a new type of aggression which in every respect is similar to the one which many years ago in this very place was condemned after being judged by the international community.84.	In any case  the people of Guinea  solidly organized in its State party under the far-sighted guidance of its beloved leader  President Ahmed Sekou Toure  is more than ever determined to defend its revolution in the profound conviction that imperialism will always find in Guinea an open grave  as was the case in November 1970. "
"50",2679,"GMB",32,1977,"﻿142.	 Mr. President  I should like to begin by congratulating you on your overwhelming election to preside over this Assembly. The Gambian delegation has no doubt that under your able and wise guidance the deliberations of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly will be both smooth and fruitful. This is because you bring to the presidency of our Assembly so much experience gained through a long and distinguished career in the service of your country and the international community.143.	Through you  Sir  I should also like to extend warm congratulations to all members of the new General Committee of the Assembly and all officers of its Main Committees. We wish all of them every success in their efforts to lead us towards meaningful decisions during the coming weeks. In this respect the full co-operation of the Gambian delegation can always be counted upon.144.	This is in keeping with the seriousness of Gambia and the high regard in which it holds the world Organization. This is especially so because we are one of the smallest States Members of the Organization in terms of both physical size and population. It can also be said that in economic terms we are one of the weakest countries in the world. A gathering of countries such as the United Nations  which  purely on the basis of our humanity  accords us rights  obligations and opportunities equal to those of other countries  big and small  and where we can meet regularly to discuss matters of common interest is in fact something vital to us.145.	That is why we cannot overemphasize the importance we attach to the structure of the Organization. This structure must be seen to reflect and to be geared towards meeting the needs of the generality of the membership. The large majority of States Members of our Organization are developing countries - that is to say  they are the centers of deprivation  disease and illiteracy. None of these evils is the direct result of the activities or inactivities of any country or group of countries alone. The existence of these evils has been and remains the direct responsibility of all of us through our individual and collective behaviour. The Organization which brings all of us together in order to discuss  plan and execute together is therefore the most suitable vehicle for making up for our mistakes and our inadequacies.146.	But we in Gambia believe that the structure of the world Organization itself has a number of serious inadequacies for the purpose which it should serve. We also believe that this Assembly is obliged to amend those inadequacies.147.	My delegation considers that the General Assembly should pronounce itself on whether or not the United Nations is indeed a gathering of equals. If  as we would sincerely wish  it is decided that all Members are equal both in the spirit and in the letter of our Charter  then we submit that in a gathering of equals there is no justification for the existence of a permanent inner circle of a few Members with the power to approve or disapprove of decisions by the vast majority of the Members.148.	The arguments which were formulated when the five permanent members of the Security Council were so designated now belong to history. They have been superseded by the more urgent  more fundamental  more widespread and more persistent human problems of hunger  malnutrition  insufficient health facilities and  in general  a deeper and wider division of the world between the  haves  and the  have-nots .149.	We frequently remind ourselves that one of the cardinal purposes of the United Nations is to prevent war and to maintain peace throughout the world. But how many wars arid breaches of the international peace have we unfortunately experienced since the birth of the Organization? What corner of the world can claim an uninterrupted period of real peace since 1945?150.	It is the belief of the Gambian delegation that  as of 1977  we have more than enough evidence that the United Nations is either not addressing itself adequately to the need to secure and maintain peace in the world or not going about the problem in an appropriate manner. We have over the past 30 year: suffered wars and breaches of the peace in all regions of the world  and we shall continue to do so until our Organization gears itself to tackling the root- causes of war and of breaches of the peace.151.	Experts in warfare and sociology will confirm that the absence of war does not mean the presence of peace. In addition to non-belligerency  peace carries with it that ease of mind that only comes to someone living in good health  under adequate and dignified shelter  someone who does not worry about where or when he will have his next full and balanced meal  someone who  in general  is able to live with and relate to all his fellow men on equal terms in every respect.152.	That is the kind of peace that should be the first goal of the United Nations; not a fire-brigade type of peace. To achieve the former quality of peace the Organization will have to consider making the membership of a body such as the Security Council reflect  considerably more than it does now  the desired aims of the world body. The sessions of the General Assembly should place increased emphasis on economic and social matters rather than delegate these exclusively to subsidiaries like UNCTAD and the Economic and Social Council. In short  our present values must be reversed. Economic  development and social problems such as the environment must supersede political problems. Instead of politicizing economic problems let us economize political problems.153.	This would be the first stage towards making the United Nations more practical. The next stage would be a decision to improve our follow-up machinery. Resolutions must not just remain pious. Once adopted the machinery should be competent and willing to implement them. In turn the General Assembly should become a more insistent watchdog over the implementation of its resolutions. It should begin doing this by a regular and frank annual assessment of the executive capacity of the various organs of the United Nations. Praise and honour would beaccorded to the meritorious and improvements made in defaulting organs.154.	This way  we feel  our Organization will begin to get its priorities correct  and become more meaningful to the millions of ordinary men and women all over the world whose fate is a determinant to whether we live in peace or not.155.	It is in the foregoing light that we view with satisfaction the holding  only a week or two ago  in Nairobi  of the first United Nations Conference on Desertification. Desertification is a major source of concern to the people of the Gambia.156.	We are a strong  courageous  hard-working and friendly people. We have a realistic and stable Government- that is dedicated to the improvement of the quality of life in the country. By this combination between the people and their Government  we have been able to baffle those prophets of doom who  when we become independent and• sovereign some 12 years ago  predicted to the rest of the world that the Gambia was not a viable proposition as an independent State.157.	Resolutely and without fuss  both the Government and people  under the wise and judicious leadership of our Head of State  Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  have embarked upon the task of nation-building—not to prove any point of anybody  but to regain our lost heritages of dignity  equality and self-reliance.158.	By the time we celebrated our first 10 years of nationhood  our achievements had brought us to the forefront among the world's most free  proud and self- respecting peoples.159.	Our economy was buoyant. As an agricultural country the turnover of our principal crops had risen by over 100 per cent. Crop diversification was successfully introduced and new areas of economic activity were initiated. Consequently  today our domestic economy continues to be encouraging.. Our gross domestic product at current market prices showed an increase of more than 21 per cent this year over 1975-1976. In 1975-1976 there was a rise under the same headings of more than 19 per cent over those of 1974-1975. That year in turn showed a rise of over 12 per cent on the previous year. At the same time the inflation rate over the same period was considerably lower than the preceding two years. Our real rate of economic growth in 1976-1977 was therefore much higher than in the preceding years.160.	I make reference to our achievements to underscore two points. The first is that  unhindered by an inequitable world economic relationship and by natural phenomena  developing countries  large or small  are capable of pulling themselves up by their own boot-straps and tackling their own problems successfully.161.	My second point is more immediate and more urgent to my country and people. All our achievements  which my colleagues will permit me to consider as impressive  stand to be whittled away by a drought which  for the second time in less than 10 years  prevails over the length and breadth of the Gambia this year.162.	As of now  when we have barely three to four weeks to the end of our rainy season  the total amount of rainfall so far varies from less than a third to less than a half of the seasonal average in large areas of the country. Already entire crops have been lost in some of these areas  and in other areas crop losses will range between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.163.	Many of our friends in the international community have been informed of this catastrophe. I am pleased to acknowledge the good deal of assistance already received from a number of quarters. The anxiety in the Gambia over the drought situation cannot be over-emphasized. We are especially worried that we may be once more on the threshold of a second spell of drought lasting for years rather than months or weeks. The situation today is disturbingly similar to that of the same period in 1968. As everybody knows  that was the onset of the five years of catastrophic drought in the Sahel which took the lives of millions of human beings  livestock  and vegetation in that region of West Africa.164.	By the time that dark period ended in 1973-1974  coupled with the world economic crisis of the same period  the Gambian economy  having made a magnificent start  was hanging in the balance. From a foreign reserves position worth about 14 months' of imports at the outset  our reserves fell to below four months' worth of imports by the end of 1974.165.	We hope and pray to Allah the Merciful and Beneficent that we are not on the threshold of a similar experience. We would also like to feel sure that humanity is one and indivisible  and that our friends individually and in the international community will come forward unhesitatingly and join us in facing an emergency situation. In this regard  I should like to place particular emphasis on the long-term needs for combating the effects of drought and preventing future droughts.166.	Let me hasten to observe that in the past  developed countries provided emergency aid to developing countries at the expense of their normal aid allocation for non-emergency purposes. When we appeal here for aid to fight an emergency situation we do so with the hope and expectation that such aid  when forthcoming  will not be a deduction from the aid packages already earmarked for us before our emergency. Such aid measures would not only be insufficient for our over-all needs  they would run high risks of being counter-productive and leaving us in more troubled waters than they found us. Emergency aid must be what it literally means. It must come from fresh  unforeseen efforts and must complement  rather than replace  planned and calculated aid.167.	I am glad to say that at the regional level the Sahel countries are already at a high level of co-ordination and mobilization in the fight against desertification and drought. Under the aegis of our permanent organization- the Permanent Inter-state Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel—the eight member countries hold regular meetings at the ministerial and heads of State levels to co-ordinate action against our common plight. It is gratifying to note the participation and full involvement of the United Nations Sahelian Office and the Club des Amis duSahel in our endeavors. It is true to say that what we have achieved so far is very much due to the collaboration of these two bodies and to other generous and dedicated international agencies.168.	Gambia is particularly pleased and honoured that the ministerial and summit meetings of the Sahelian countries will be held in its capital  Banjul  early in December this year  and my Head of State has given me the mandate to extend our heartfelt invitation to all international agencies and organizations which are preoccupied with the improvement of the quality of life in the world to attend the Banjul meetings. The ministerial meeting will be from 8 to 10 December and the summit will be on 12 and 13 December.169.	In Gambia we believe firmly in the principle and the practice of human rights and dignity. That is why we always place ourselves on the side of every people fighting against foreign domination  oppression based upon any form of racial or class distinction  and any form of dictatorship of a given minority over a given majority.170.	Gambia  like most other countries represented in this Assembly  was under foreign rule for a number of centuries. Throughout the dark period of our history  our people were deprived of the most basic forms of human rights. They had no say in choosing their rulers or in deciding how they should be ruled. They were obliged to abandon their culture and to assimilate foreign culture. They had no freedom of movement or assembly  nor any freedom of speech.171.	It is the view of our Head of State  Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  that once freed from such a long period of countless forms of indignities  the least our people deserves is an unhindered opportunity to live a free  dignified and secure life.172.	It is our view that widespread lip-service is paid to the issue of human rights but very little real practical effort goes towards achieving these rights.173.	If  for example  the Western Powers were really committed to changing the odious system of apartheid in South Africa  it is the view of my delegation that the system could not have survived all the pious resolutions and calls for its abrogation in this Assembly and in other international forums. Instead we see the South African regime going from strength to strength to the point of becoming a nuclear Power.174.	That  of course  is thanks to the active and far- reaching economic  military and political collaboration of major Western countries. To us  the message is clear. For the sake of amassing profits from slave labour  those Western Powers are willing to encourage and finance investments in the South African economy. They go even further than that by giving extensive military and political assistance and backing to ensure the stability of the apartheid system. To those countries material gains such as a healthy balance of payments and a buoyant economy take precedence over the freedom and dignity of man. Those Powers sustain and dominate the South African economy. Yet they turn round and join those of us who make sincere efforts and protestations against the racist regime—purely on the basis of our respect for the dignity of man and the sanctity of his life.175.	The issue of human rights is a composite one. The existence of those rights is not represented by the mere absence of political prisoners or of government by decree. In our view an individual's rights as a human being extend far beyond and go much deeper than those. An individual who enjoys his full human rights is not hungry or thirsty in the midst of plenty. He does not eat or drink from the leftovers of others. He has the right to decent and adequate health and education facilities  and clothing. He has sovereignty over the fruits of his labours and over the natural resources of his motherland. He looks upon other people with the same amount of equality and respect as they do upon him.176.	Those are prerequisites of human rights  which transcend national and international boundaries. They are by no means easy to attain. But they form the core of man's wish and will to live. Life cannot be meaningful without them. So we are all obliged to make human rights our major pursuit in life. Let us first achieve universal human rights and everything else will be added unto us.177.	As I said earlier  our concern in the Gambia for human rights makes us rally to the side of all peoples fighting to free themselves from any form of foreign  racist and unjust oppression. My country  therefore  never ceases to condemn the illegal regime of Ian Smith in Zimbabwe  the South African occupation of Namibia  the Zionist occupation of African and Arab territories in the Middle East  and the French occupation of the Comorian island of Mayotte.178.	Bolstered by Western economic interests and by white racists  the Smith regime has defied international condemnation for over a decade. During that period it has continued to receive its fair share of world trade and essential commodities. Its agents have travelled freely and openly all over the world. Communications between that regime and the outside world have remained unhindered. All this  in a country against which every member of our Organization professes to be applying sanctions. The Gambian delegation is convinced that we are not living up to our solemn declarations. If we kept our word  it is inconceivable that a fledgling clique such as that in Salisbury could continue to prosper against our joint wish and will. This is why Gambia  and indeed all other African countries  have come to the conclusion that an armed struggle is the only sure means of crushing the rebels in Zimbabwe.179.	We have reached this conclusion with a sense of regret and a certain amount of sadness. That is because we  like all our African brothers  would very much have preferred a peaceful solution. We regard any life lost in the present liberation struggle  be it that of a black or that of a white Zimbabwean  as a great and almost irreparable loss of human resources for the future nation. The march of history cannot be halted and the end is clear. Zimbabwe will soon be under black majority rule  come what may. Why  then  must the lives of its young  strong and healthy citizens be wasted?180.	Those are the feelings and questions which make us willing to continue searching for a peaceful settlement in a parallel effort to the armed struggle. That is also the reason why we feel that the latest Anglo-American proposals for a peaceful settlement deserve to be taken seriously and given a chance.181.	My delegation sincerely hopes that it does not have to come to the same conclusion on Namibia. At the twenty-first session in 1966 this Assembly decided to terminate South Africa's Mandate over the Territory. This was in accordance with the opinion given by the International Court of Justice. The following year  during the fifth special session the United Nations Council for Namibia was established to administer the Territory and prepare it for independence.182.	Yet what do we have today? We are still negotiating with the South African racists on the timing and manner of independence for the Territory. Meanwhile the Namibians  ironically through a considered decision inherited by the General Assembly  continue to be oppressed and exploited by the most opprobrious political and social system that ever was  and the regime in Pretoria continues to carry the Territory along a predetermined path to assimilation into the apartheid set-up.183.	Faced with this situation and encouraged by the spontaneous rallying of the entire Namibian population to the call of the South West African People's Organization for immediate and complete independence  my delegation might well come to feel that there is no alternative to armed struggle. We shall adopt that position for the simple reason that that people's human rights cannot continue to be a subject of negotiations and a matter of give and take.184.	My Government's position on the French occupation of the Comorian island of Mayotte is well known. France likes the world to believe that it is a champion of democracy. But whereas democracy respects and accommodates the wishes of the minority  it proceeds on the basis of the wishes of the majority. France's presence in Mayotte is a complete negation of this basic principle of democracy. When France was the colonial Power over the Territory  it administered it as a single colony. Therefore  France cannot now pretend to any rights or duties to dismember the Territory on the basis of pockets of  Yes  and  No  votes.185.	The Republic of the Comoros is unitary and indivisible. For a country of France's standing in world affairs and in the so-called free world to claim otherwise is to lower its international credibility.186.	As I said earlier  the Gambian Government is opposed to all forms of occupation or acquisition by force of any territory  and when it involves the territory of an African or friendly State  we are that much more opposed to the act. This is why we will not cease to denounce Zionist aggression in the Middle East until Israel withdraws from every inch of territory it has occupied during and since the 1967 war. The arguments used in creating theState of Israel are familiar to us all. That is why we find still less acceptable the present seizure of Arab and African territories on the basis of a supposed need for a national home—unless  of course  one would have us believe that Jews need a national home more than Palestinians. That  indeed  is the clear implication. And until Israel vacates all occupied territory and until our Palestinian brothers have a secure and adequate national home in the birthplace of their ancestors  we shall continue to regard Zionism as racism and to speak against the regime in Tel Aviv. In this respect  we have committed our unreserved support  morally  politically and materially  to our Arab brothers in their struggle for their birthright against international Zionism and its mentors.187. It is with some sadness that I have to make reference to the divided land of Korea. For too long now  the people of Korea  sharing the same culture  the same history  the same language and  in some cases  even the same ancestors  have suffered an artificial demarcation that divides them from one another. This is contrary to their wishes and aspirations. Left to themselves alone  it is obvious that they would have solved their family problems internally and peacefully and would have reunified their country by now. The Gambian delegation would like to see all foreign interests stand aside and leave the Korean people alone to solve their own internal problems.188. The Korean nation is an intelligent and purposeful one. If in working out their differences the Korean people decide that they need the assistance of an outside agent  we are sure they will not fail to appeal to the right quarters for such assistance. We believe that the most appropriate source of such assistance would be the United Nations. We are also convinced that the world body would not shirk its responsibilities if it were approached for any assistance in reunifying this divided people  and would thereby contribute immensely to the warding off of a constant threat to world peace."
"51",2716,"GNB",32,1977,"﻿152.	 Sir  I wish to say how happy I am to associate myself with the preceding speakers in welcoming with great satisfaction and friendship your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. In my view  that choice is fully in accord with the eminent qualities as a diplomat and statesman for which you are noted  and is a tribute to the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia  a sister country with which we have solid  friendly relations which were established at the beginning of our national liberation struggle and have since been consolidated. Your election also crowns the tireless efforts and dynamic action which you have constantly contributed to our Organization in the interests of the progress of our nations and of peace for mankind. In other words  your election represents to us a pledge of the devotion  effectiveness and success with which you will be guiding our work.153.	May I also  through you  extend my sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Sri Lanka to the United Nations  who won general acclaim by the great skill with which he presided over the thirty-first session of our Assembly.154.	May I be allowed to greet the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom I am pleased once again to assure of our full co-operation. On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau  I offer him our congratulations on the noteworthy results constantly being achieved by the United Nations in the interests of our respective nations and of peace for mankind.155.	I wish also to express my delegation's satisfaction at the admission to the United Nations of the SocialistRepublic of Viet Nam  a country which is both our brother and our friend. Viet Nam  which represents to us the finest example of a people's courage  self-abnegation and love of freedom  has finally taken its rightful place in this comity of nations. To attain that place it has had to make innumerable sacrifices in defence of the principles of our Organization. Hence its admission is  in our view  a historic event and a step forward in the achievement of the objectives of our Charter and of the principle of the universality of the United Nations. I am sure that the brother-people of Viet Nam  for which we have deep admiration  will enrich the United Nations through its remarkable qualities and  above all  its long and dynamic experience in the struggle for peace.156.	The entry of the Republic of Djibouti into this great United Nations family is a source of pride for all African peoples and for the world at large  which has followed with interest and supported with admiration that people's struggle for independence. We hope that the international community will give the people of Djibouti all necessary assistance in the defence and consolidation of its independence.157.	Since the thirty-first session  there has been but little substantial change in the problems confronting mankind. Our Organization  despite its praiseworthy efforts  has not managed to give real impetus to international detente. The conflicts which persist here and there should encourage us to unite our co-operative efforts in the search for just and durable solutions.158.	Once again the oppressed peoples send us an appeal  made urgent by their sufferings  to join them  basing ourselves firmly on the fundamental principles of our Organization  in their search for the necessary ways and means of achieving the complete eradication of all vestiges of colonialism  oppression  injustice and racism.159.	For our part  we bear in mind as a constant factor in our efforts respect for human rights  equality and the right of peoples to self-determination and the choice of their own destiny. We are all the more attached to these principles because they are indissolubly linked to the documents of international law of the United Nations: the Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.160.	The people of Guinea-Bissau  who throughout a long armed struggle for national liberation and at the cost of many sacrifices gained their independence and right to freedom  feel as their own the bitter trials undergone by its brothers in southern Africa  and therefore follow with particular interest the developments in that part of the world.161.	That is why we feel that the United Nations must show more unity and invite Member States to respect and apply its decisions rigorously in order to be able to make an effective contribution to the struggle for peace  and give it wider dimensions and greater impetus.162.	Since we are unanimous in recognizing and condemning unjust  inhuman and criminal nature of racism  let us also be unanimous in focusing our efforts unreservedly on the struggle against this scourge of the world.163.	Armed struggle is a necessity  the only means and the only path which can lead the people of southern Africa towards total and real liberation. This means the intransigent defence of the sacred principles with which the international community as a whole is identified. We cannot deny their justice; we cannot refute their objectivity.164.	The people of South Africa  by rejecting the policy of apartheid and struggling against it with all their force  are defending our own freedom  that of mankind as a whole  which can only be the achievement of all men  without distinction as to race  creed or philosophical belief.165.	In other words  we -have responsibilities which we must assume in full  bringing to the peoples of southern Africa assistance in accordance with their needs  intensifying it whenever circumstances and the extension of the struggle so demand.166.	First of all  we must concert our efforts to prevent  by all means possible  a situation in which South Africa would be in a position to use the atomic bomb in order to perpetuate its system of exploitation and oppression. We are aware of this danger  which may have catastrophic consequences  but our apprehension must not be taken to mean anything other than an urgent appeal to countries which  for trade  political or other reasons  feel they must ignore or breach the decisions of the United Nations concerning the supply of equipment  technology and fissionable material to the racist regime of South Africa. There is no guarantee ensuring the use of such technology for peaceful purposes in that country  in view of the inhuman and criminal nature of its regime.167.	By stepping up our assistance to the oppressed people of South Africa  we should also be contributing to the struggle of the liberation movements in Namibia and Zimbabwe. Only the triumph of the freedom fighters can put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist Government of South Africa.168.	SWAPO  which is the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people  must be assisted effectively and supported by our Organization in all its efforts to eliminate totally South African domination. We firmly hope that soon  through the concerted actions of the freedom fighters and the international community  the true sons of that country can take their place in this Assembly beside us.169.	The recent decision of the Heads of State and Government at the OAU Assembly in Libreville to recognize the Patriotic Front as the sole representative of the people of Zimbabwe  is not only a clear reflection of the common will of the African States to concentrate their efforts on concerted and more effective action in. support of the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe  but we believe also an appeal from the OAU to the other peoples of the world  and in particular to the United Nations  for active solidarity in support of that brother people.170.	In view of the repeated acts of aggression on the part of Ian Smith's mercenaries against Mozambique  Zambia and Botswana  acts of aggression which we forcefully condemn  we cannot fail to stress the urgency and the imperative need to co-ordinate our political  diplomatic and material support for the Patriotic Front.171.	This is all the more essential since it is true that only an increase in the fighting strength of the Patriotic Front  which needs considerable material and financial resources  can really halt the perfidious acts of terrorism and barbarism carried out by the Rhodesian racists against the front-line countries.172.	The OAU Assembly  at the end of its proceedings in Libreville  also took a vital decision: to convene in the near future an extraordinary session on Western Sahara. This session is most timely  because it is a question of reaffirming  in accordance with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU  the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination.173.	We are convinced that this session will offer good prospects for a final solution of the problem.174.	But my Government has not forgotten that it is the peoples themselves that determine their future  and no one has the right to impose solutions on them. The peoples will choose  according to the circumstances  the best way to seize their liberty  because independence in the long run must be won.175.	That is why it is essential  in our opinion  that at the next extraordinary session on the question of Western Sahara the gap between rhetoric and reality be closed and only the voice and the higher interests of the Saharan people should prevail.176.	The position of my Government in regard to this problem is clear and can only take the form of militant and active solidarity with the Frente POLISARIO and unflinching support for the cause so valiantly defended by the Saharan people/It is history itself  the history of the heroic struggle of peoples for their independence  which inspires us and encourages us in this course.177.	We should also like to express solidarity with the people and Government of the Comoros  in view of the illegal occupation of part of their national territory by the former colonizing Power. The occupation of Mayotte in contravention of the principles governing international relations is an infringement of the sovereignty of the Comoros and calls for an urgent solution to restore the full rights of the Comorian people in defence of their territorial integrity and unity.178.	The situation in the Middle East remains one of the essential concerns of my Government. The heroic struggle of the Palestinian people for its most legitimate rights continues to merit particular attention and deserves the total support of all the peoples of the world. How could it be otherwise  indeed  since we are well aware of the worst oppressions and the subjection of the people of Palestine and committed as we all are to the principles of the United Nations Charter  to the defence of man and his right to freedom  peace and well-being?179.	Faced with the stubborn refusal of Israel to respect and apply the repeated recommendations of the international community  faced with the arrogance of the successive Governments of that country  which  as in a relay race  passes the stick and entrenches itself ostentatiously in the most reactionary positions  the international community must take steps to adopt a more realistic and consistent strategy. Indeed  only the continuous pressure of our concerted forces can speedily produce concrete results and make a positive contribution to the triumph of the struggle of the Palestinian people.180.	The flood of blood and tears caused by the annexationist policy of the Government of Israel  far from dampening the liberating zeal and the determination of the freedom fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization  undoubtedly produce new forces  daily more capable of annihilating the chains of oppression.181.	We feel that we must tell this Assembly yet again that in the opinion of our Government any negotiated solution of the problem must have as an indispensable pre-condition the recognition by Israel of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland  to freedom and to progress on the one hand and to the evacuation of the Arab territories occupied since 1967 on the other.182.	Although we recognize the importance of the positive contribution such a country can make to the much desired settlement of the conflict  there can be no substitute for the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people-that is to say the Palestine Liberation Organization  which  more than anyone else  defends the interests of this brother people. I should like to say again from this rostrum that the Government and people of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau support totally and unconditionally the sacred cause of the brother people of Palestine.183.	Last year  on the occasion of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  I raised with some apprehension the question of East Timor and said how concerned my Government was by the situation in that country. Today we have to say that  despite the appeal from the United Nations to Indonesia that country  deaf and insensible  continues its illegal occupation of East Timor  and thousands of the people of Timor  women  children and the aged  are dying or still suffering from the fire and the arrogant boots of the Indonesian armed forces.184.	This unjust war was imposed on a people which  after having known and endured the long dark night of colonialism were calmly preparing to face courageously the no less terrible problems of development and constitutes in our opinion a flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The very idea that  for reasons of political  military or economic convenience  a country can annex another independent country and trample underfoot the most elementary principles governing human relations is inadmissible and calls for the strongest possible condemnation. In our opinion the United Nations must take appropriate measures with a view to going to the assistance of the people of East Timor who  under the leadership and the impetus of the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente  is conducting a heroic struggle to repel the Indonesian aggressors and to build a land of peace and progress.185.	But it must be emphasized that in this war it is not simply a matter of the interests of the victims of aggression and of the aggressors: there are also other interests at stake which are better concealed because they are more perfidious in nature  and they should be brought into the open and condemned with equal severity. The Government and people of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau firmly support FRETILIN and the people of Timor in their struggle for true independence and express again their unflinching solidarity with the Democratic Republic of East Timor.186.	The United Nations once again will have to deal carefully with the situation in Chile  where despite many appeals to the Chilean authorities from the international community urging them to restore and safeguard the rights  the freedom and the well-being of the people of Chile by observing the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Government of that country continues  with total disdain for human values  to bludgeon and make martyrs of the Chilean people. We feel that the United Nations can do more to help the Chilean people who  in extremely difficult conditions  are carrying on an exemplary struggle for their freedom and for the return of democracy.187.	The situation in Cyprus demands that we redouble our efforts and work for the maintenance of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island  inspired by the constant dynamic activity and wisdom of the man who was and will remain one of the greatest figures in the struggle for peace  the late President Makarios. On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau I should like to take this opportunity to pay an appropriate tribute to his stature  his merits  his talents and his valour.188.	We hope that the two Cypriot communities  Greek and Turkish  thanks to their will to maintain peace  will arrive at a lasting agreement which will guarantee a brotherly coexistence respecting the rights of all citizens of the Cypriot State.189.	We have often proclaimed our attachment to the ideals of peace and progress of the United Nations but above all we have expressed our confidence in the unshakable will of the international community to fight for the maintenance of world peace and security. This confidence is further strengthened by the conviction that all Member States are aware of the importance of peace for the progress of their peoples.190.	We have always followed with great interest the debates in this Assembly concerning this problem and have shared the concerns of the international community in the face of the imminent dangers inherent in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Our apprehension is justified because it must be noted that the arms race has not slowed down but has even become a contagious disease which  if not tackled swiftly and effectively  may have disastrous  indeed incalculable  consequences for mankind as a whole.191. Military budgets  although apparently diminishing in official debates and statistics  have not lost their increasingly alarming proportions. It is true that the United Nations has made remarkable efforts to inform world opinion of the problem and to extend its dynamic action to all the nuclear-weapon States.192.	Today  when we are talking about the neutron bomb  a weapon which is undoubtedly of terrible destructive capacity  it is well to recall that this action  which we firmly support  could not really have truly satisfactory results if it is confined to the simple aim of checking an expansion or proliferation of nuclear weapons.193.	What we also have to contemplate-and urgently in our opinion-is  through a stage-by-stage negotiation process  total and complete disarmament and the destruction of those weapons which  as long as they exist  are a threat to mankind.194.	Thus  we welcome the forthcoming convening of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  the importance and the pressing need for which we fully appreciate.195.	We hope  for our part  that the international community will be able  through constructive discussion  to create the basis essential to the signing of a general agreement on the limitation  indeed the destruction  of nuclear weapons.196.	I wished to mention some of the dangers threatening international security  but the situation currently prevailing in Africa also deserves special attention from us. Africa  despite its differences and peculiarities  is above all a geopolitical whole which history has forged into a vigorous and at the same time sensitive body. The only frontiers in Africa are artificial ones  and no African people  regardless of its economic potential  can ensure its happiness  well- being and development by ignoring the problems affecting its neighbours. It is the very interdependence of African States which is at once their weakness and their strength- which means that any problem  any intra-African conflict  however grave  can always be given a peaceful solution based in African wisdom. This tradition is one of the major strengths of our continent and has largely contributed to the establishment of the OAU and has made it an effective instrument in the search for peaceful solutions to problems which sometimes divide African States.197.	The OAU Charter embodies a set of principles the observance of which  by all member States  constitutes the pre-condition and the guarantee for a united Africa  committed to the construction of progress in peace.198.	The major upheavals currently affecting the economic bases of international relations affect all countries and  above all  the developing countries. That is  in any case  why we are all responsible for finding a way out of this situation. But it is not enough to take partial measures to plaster over the existing system. The present system of international economic relations is long out of date  and is detrimental to our interests. It has to be replaced by another system  one that is more just and more equitable. To do this what is needed is not evolution but really revolution.199.	The proliferation of contacts should be continued and closer co-operation between developed countries with different economic and social systems should be extended to the international community as a whole and thus provide a basis for development towards a new form of economic  trade and technological relations based on national complementarity and establishing the conditions for fuller development in accordance with our needs and potential.200.	Indeed  one must look increasingly for solutions taking precisely into account the differences in political and economic systems at the end of the twentieth century. New methods  concepts  rules and institutions must be found  harmonized  agreed to and applied  so that  finally and in practical terms  we can start along a path ensuring satisfaction and the meeting of the legitimate aspirations of all peoples  with no discrimination whatsoever. It is well known that these aspirations are being expressed through claims for independence and equality in international relations and for the establishment of economic conditions which make it possible for everyone to live in peace by restoring to the majority of mankind the rights to which they are entitled:201.	This claim is basically each country's sovereign right to dispose of its natural resources  including the right to nationalize them; the need to introduce into this system of international economic relations instruments which will ensure compensation and make it possible to set up special protective funds against dislocations on the world market; the need to develop a code of conduct for the transfer of scientific and technological discoveries  it being understood that we have to facilitate the access of the developing countries to modern technology  which they-must be able to use on advantageous terms; the need to reinvigorate the search for supplementary sources of financing for economic and social progress in the developing countries.202.	These claims are nothing new. They were in particular set forth in the Economic Declaration of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973. We can find them again in a number of United Nations documents and in documents of other international bodies. They were restated in the Manila Declaration by the Ministerial Conference of the Group of 77 and in the Economic Declaration and Action Programme for Economic Cooperation of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  the proceedings of which were held at Colombo from 16 to 20 August 1976. But to date they still meet with the organized opposition of the industrialized countries  particularly the most powerful among them. This was clearly shown once again at the North-South Conference at Paris  where the refusal of those countries to arrive at a general agreement caused those proceedings to fail. The reasons were many. The most important  doubtless  is that the industrialized Powers are seeking to safeguard their position of domination in the world economy. However  it should be added that the developed countries are also becoming increasingly aware of the fact that such a policy is getting them nowhere. Hence  among the industrialized States the decision has been taken to undertake some initiatives with respect to a dialogue with the developing countries.203.	One thing is certain: these industrialized countries have themselves admitted the need to reform the existing international trade and monetary system. So it is not a matter of an unexpected attack on the interests of the industrialized capitalist Powers  but an inevitable measure taken in the interests of all. The deficit of the developing countries  which derives from the discrimination they suffer in the international economic system  is continuing to worsen in disquieting proportions. Needless to say  this worsening is a supplementary burden for those countries whose indebtedness is known to us all and which was clearly one of the concerns of the Colombo Conference.204.	The major documents adopted at different international conferences bear witness to our will  as non-aligned countries  to enter into a dialogue with the developed countries in order to establish more equitable relations in the world. But over and above this willingness  we are working for the rapid establishment of a new international economic order.205.	The Colombo documents offer in themselves a more dynamic basis for this resumed dialogue. We are also thinking in particular of the Economic Declaration and the Action Programme for Economic Co-operation. That is of course understandable when we realize that the principles of those documents reflect the broadest interests of the peoples and give the policy of peaceful coexistence  mutual assistance  solidarity and active co-operation an economic basis resting on both the Charter of the United Nations and that of the non-aligned movement.206.	In view of the seriousness of the problems we are facing  the developing countries are more than ever aware of the imperative need to devote their energies to the consolidation of their national independence and the strengthening of their front-line struggle for the final eradication of the existing arrangements for economic exploitation The action of the non-aligned countries at the Conferences of Belgrade  Cairo  Lusaka and Georgetown  the decline of colonialist or neo-colonialist groups  the strengthening of the unity of action of the Group of 77 on the basis of the provisions of the Algiers Charter and the Declaration of Lima and the action taken for regional co-operation or integration  are so many stages on the way from passive claims to the active affirmation of the will of the developing countries to rely first and foremost on their own resources  individually and collectively  to assume responsibility for the defence of their fundamental interests and to organize their development by and for themselves.207.	It should be recalled here that there is a sacred principle  according to which every country has a right to adopt the economic and social system which it regards as the most advantageous to its development  and that States have an inalienable right to exercise their national sovereignty over their natural resources and over all the economic activities of the country. We feel that any infringement of those rights or of the right of each State to exercise effective control over its natural resources and their exploitation by the means most consonant with its own circumstances-including nationalization and the transfer of ownership to nationals-is contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and is an obstacle to the development of international co-operation and the maintenance of international peace and security.208.	It would be unrealistic to think that there could be any true equality between donors and recipients  or that our political emancipation could have any reality without economic independence obtained through co-operation in equality and mutual respect.209.	These are the considerations we wished to bring to the attention of our Assembly.210.	May I  in closing  repeat on behalf of my delegation that we are willing to contribute to the search for a just solution to the problems affecting the international community  and we wish to state that we hope to see the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations achieve satisfactory results and thus satisfy our joint will to work for international peace and security.

"52",2800,"GRC",32,1977,"﻿130.	Mr. President  I am very happy to convey to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  which constitutes just recognition of your high qualities and of your profound experience in world affairs  as well as of the important role that your country plays in international life. The Greek delegation is particularly gratified by the fact that our two countries  which are linked by close ties of friendship  are sincerely collaborating  at both the international and the regional levels  for peace and co-operation among peoples.131.	I am also happy to express our deep appreciation for the lofty spirit and great competence shown by your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  in guiding the work of the previous session of the General Assembly.132.	We welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Djibouti and of the Socialist Republic  of Viet Nam. We address our sincere wishes to the new Members  which  we are certain  will make a valuable contribution to the work of the United Nations.133.	Regarding the world situation and the current state of international relations  we cannot but subscribe to the analysis made by the Secretary-General in his report on the activities of our Organization. This year  which has raised so many hopes  leaves us no closer to the solution of the great problems which preoccupy us. Whether it is the problem of the Middle East or of South Africa  or of Cyprus or even of the establishment of a new international economic order  we are still faced with persistent obstacles. The task this General Assembly is called upon to fulfil is to renew its efforts in favour of law and justice.134.	It is indeed not sufficient to record each year the deficiencies of our Organization and to deplore them in unison; we must show that we have the political and moral will to correct them in order to render the United Nations worthy of its mission. We must above all react against the erosion of the security system provided for by the Charter  and against the lack of respect by some for the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations and particularly for the decisions of the Security Council. In fact we find ourselves  more and more  faced with the use of force or the threat of force in relations between States  while we note at the same time a tendency towards the adoption by the Security Council of anodyne resolutions ""by consensus""  which place offender and victim on an equal footing.135.	On the other hand  we are witnessing a terrifying recrudescence of the arms race  which is no longer limited to the great Powers but is spreading to all regions and to all the corners of the earth. This phenomenon results in an appalling waste of resources which  in turn  seriously obstructs economic progress and the well-being of peoples.136.	Consequently  it is important that we should strive for the success of the new efforts which are being made on the crucial question of disarmament.137.	It is in this context that Greece supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to disarmament and expresses the hope that this session will  with the active participation of all States  result in a programme of action entailing concrete measures with a view to general and complete disarmament.138.	For the same reasons we are in favour of the convening of a world conference on disarmament.139.	It is understood that disarmament should cover both nuclear and conventional armaments. It should also ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons by providing guarantees to the non-nuclear countries as regards both their security and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.140.	I should now like to present the views of my Government on certain problems which are particularly pressing.141.	We continue to follow with great attention the development of the situation in the Middle East. For our part we feel that the time has come for a major effort towards peace in that tormented region.142.	It is therefore essential not to waste more time on procedural questions. In this connexion we appreciate the substantial steps which the Arab Governments principally concerned with the problem have taken in order to facilitate the convening of the Geneva Conference. As for the substance of the question  we adhere to the United Nations resolutions which  taken in their entirety  lay down the guidelines for a just and lasting solution. Such a solution must entail the evacuation of all Arab territories occupied since June 1967  on the basis of the principle that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible. It must also provide solid guarantees for respect for the sovereignty  the independence  and the territorial integrity of all the States in the region. There can be no doubt that any negotiation must take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their aspiration for a national homeland.143.	The intense diplomatic activity and efforts made to solve the problems of Namibia and Southern Rhodesia  as well as the focusing of international attention on what is going on in southern Africa  augur well for respect for human rights and for the application of the principle of government by majority rule.144.	Greece has constantly supported the principle of self-determination during the historical process of decolonization. It vigorously condemns apartheid and every other form of racial discrimination. We shall continue to give all our support to efforts aiming at ensuring respect for human dignity  equality  security and progress for all the peoples of that region  without discrimination on grounds of race  colour or creed.145.	Before dealing with the Cyprus problem  I wish to pay a tribute in this Assembly to the memory of Archbishop Makarios  the first President of the Republic of Cyprus. The deceased Chief of State dedicated his life to the idea of freedom and struggled for the independence of his country and for the preservation of its territorial integrity. He was one of the founders of the non-aligned movement  which plays an important role in our time.146.	The Greek Government has on many occasions expressed before the General Assembly and the Security Council its position regarding the evolution of the situation in Cyprus. At the time of the invasion of the island by the armed forces of Turkey  the Ankara Government pretended that it had acted in pursuance of the Treaty of Guarantee. Without entering into the examination of the legality-more than doubtful-of that action  it suffices to observe today that  after three full years have elapsed  the Turkish army is still present in the island in spite of all United Nations resolutions to the contrary. Moreover  far from having re-established the state of affairs provided for by the treaties  Turkey  by pursuing its aim to create a situation which would suit it alone  avoids pronouncing itself on the elements of a solution. The United Nations Secretary- General has presided over six rounds of negotiations in Vienna without being able to announce the slightest progress. The Turkish-Cypriot negotiator has persistently taken refuge in an impenetrable negativism. It is characteristic of this attitude that the Turkish Cypriots have not to this day replied to the proposal of the Greek-Cypriot negotiator  dated 23 August  to resume the dialogue in Nicosia.147.	It is common knowledge that one of the most important elements of an eventual solution is the territorial aspect of the problem. In a federal arrangement  it would be inadmissible for the 18 per cent minority to retain under its jurisdiction 40 per cent of the island's territory  occupied now by the Turkish army  which would perpetuate the problem of the 200 000 refugees in the south. And yet  very recently  when it was expected that a real effort towards peace would be undertaken  the Turkish Cypriots chose the moment to unleash the threat of colonizing the new city of Famagusta  which has remained sealed off and has symbolized Turkish acceptance of the principle of revision of the status quo imposed by force.148.	We all know that the Security Council has pronounced itself against such action.149.	It is not clear to what extent the Turkish Government supports these extreme positions of the Turkish- Cypriot leadership. One might say that in the presence of a strong Turkish army in Cyprus  the Turkish-Cypriot leadership are not able to act as they please. It is evident that if Ankara and the Turks of Cyprus do not adopt more reasonable and moderate positions in the immediate future  the few remaining hopes for a rapid solution will disappear. We believe that the General Assembly should once more express its determination to see the Cyprus problem settled without delay on the basis of the previous resolutions of the United Nations.150.	Greece  being in favour of the policy of detente  has done everything possible in order to improve and deepen its relations with all countries and particularly those of neighbouring regions. We are happy to say that the results have been very positive and in certain cases remarkable. Whenever disputes arise  we have always opted for peaceful means of settlement. This is precisely the case in our differences with Turkey  which are due to problems that have not been caused by Greece. In compliance with our obligations under the United Nations Charter  we are determined to resolve these problems by peaceful means and  naturally  within the framework of respect for the sovereign and legitimate rights of our country.151.	That is our contribution to detente and we hope that Turkey will do its share in order to avert all dangers to peace in this region.152.	In pursuit of this policy  Greece has actively participated in the preparatory meeting in Belgrade of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and we welcome the constructive results that have been obtained. We intend to continue this effort in co-operation with the countries signatory to the Helsinki Final Act in order to seek additional measures likely to reinforce security and co-operation in Europe. We trust that the positive development of detente in Europe will have a favourable influence on co-operation and peace in the Mediterranean as well as in other regions in the world.153.	I would not like to conclude my intervention without referring to two major issues: the new economic order and the question of human rights.154.	Concerning the first one  we regret that the Conference on International Economic Co-operation has not had the success it deserved. May I be allowed to express  in this regard  the concern of my country for the economic problems of third-world countries  which for reasons beyond their will  have fallen considerably behind in the march toward development. We consider that it is indeed time to set in motion the process for the establishment of a new economic order and for the restructuring of international society on the basis of a more equitable sharing of resources. For we cannot hope for fruitful international co-operation or the prosperity of peoples so long as the present flagrant inequalities continue to exist.155.	In the area of human rights  I should like to recall that Greece  during the past sessions of the General Assembly  has taken a number of initiatives for the suppression of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.156.	We intend to persevere in this direction and we are ready to support firmly all efforts in the United Nations aiming at the progressive elimination of imperfections or deficiencies in the application of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We shall do so in the profound conviction that our Organization must never lose from sight its raison d’être  which is respect for the dignity and the progress of that unique being  man. "
"53",2843,"GRD",32,1977,"﻿ 1.	""O praise the Lord  all ye nations: praise him  all ye people. For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord endured for ever"" 2.	I bring with me from the Government and people of a small but vibrant and aspiring nation  Grenada  the land of spice  a land of warm and genuine friendship  a land of sunshine and a land and people irrevocably dedicated to the philosophy of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man-it is from this land and people that I bring you warmest and sincerest greetings and felicitations  as they have mandated me as their humble chief servant to make a contribution to the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of this veritable and august body  the United Nations. This mandate I have accepted with a mixture of feelings and emotions in that  first  I harbour some measure of apprehension as to my ability to attain the standard already established by previous speakers. Secondly  I am under an aroused emotion of excitement in the matters I intend to raise at this session. Thirdly and fortunately  I have a degree of faith and satisfaction in being motivated by divine inspiration to present by my humble address some contribution towards the lessening of world tension and the establishment and maintenance of total human freedom and a meaningful and lasting world peace.3.	May I  on behalf of the Government and people of Grenada  offer you  Mr. President  our sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Indeed  your ascendancy to that enviable and exalted office is the culmination of a distinguished record of public service both inside and outside the United Nations and more particularly in the areas of international relations and diplomacy  as well as your excellence in the fields of law and journalism. The standard set by your predecessor certainly offers you a great challenge which you have accepted by virtue of your assumption of this office. I have absolutely no doubt that you  Mr. President  will face the challenge with optimum success and distinction and perhaps establish new records for your successors.4.	At this juncture may I be permitted to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  for his invaluable  excellent and dedicated leadership as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. His dedicated service to the United Nations during his presidency and even before will be indelibly recorded in the annals of the United Nations.5.	May I crave the Assembly's indulgence to focus the spotlight of congratulations on a very modest but extremely able and distinguished personality  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our beloved Secretary-General  a man who undoubtedly appreciates the needs  requirements and the growing problems especially of the under-developed and developing countries. Mr. Waldheim's extreme dedication and the diligence with which he has been dealing with some of those problems must unquestionably place him on the pinnacle of love and admiration for all those who have had the privilege of coming into direct contact with him.6.	Please permit- me also to take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on their admission to full membership in the United Nations. It is quite significant to note that  since Grenada's admission to membership in the United Nations  12 other countries have been similarly admitted—a salient fact that indicates a trend .towards the fulfilment  de facto  of the United Nations' entrenched obligation to work towards universality within the Charter.7.	We have always expressed the view  more particularly so since we became an independent country  that  in spite of our size with respect to landmass and population  we will not allow ourselves to be inhibited in any way  least of all in our obligation to make a meaningful contribution within the framework of this Organization. In this context  we have been quite clear and loud in our submissions during previous debates of the General Assembly and in committees dealing with specific issues. Admittedly  some of the matters that we have raised here and shall continue to raise here may be considered by some to be strange and somewhat extraneous  but at least some of those matters have triggered speculation and ignited the hearts and minds of at least some people involved in various areas of human endeavour and development.8.	Permit me here to mention just a few of those matters to which we have given expression over the last three years: Grenada's firm commitment to the rule of law and order; its acceptance of its international obligations; the fatherhood  supremacy and universality of God  and man's duties to his fellow man; Grenada's dedication to world peace; human rights; women's rights; Grenada's concern and provision for its youth; the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle; our support of territorial integrity; decolonization and the liberation of all peoples; economic cruelty and exploitation as meted out by imperialist masters; man's fear of unlocking the door to himself and evolving; the release of information and data on unidentified flying objects and related phenomena; the new international economic order; pollution; the human environment  and psychic research.9.	Today I should like to address my first contribution to the concept of the new international economic order as it relates to third-world countries.10.	Unfortunately  we are not satisfied that there is among many of the world's richer nations a full understanding of and a sympathy for some of the real problems facing small island nations like Grenada  where the deep imprint of exploitation remains indelible and the disabilities of geography continue to be an obstruction to development.11.	Grenada is concerned and feels a sense of frustration over the seemingly endless dialogue that has been proceeding in international forums on the establishment of a new international economic order  though there are certain hopeful signs which indicate that the discussions concluded so far cannot be regarded as a ""dialogue of the deaf. However  many countries have not yet succeeded in providing to the developing countries anything near what they should give in the form of economic and technical co-operation  thus allowing the gap between the developed and the developing countries to grow even wider.12.	May I reiterate an important observation that Grenada has been making at other international forums to the effect that it is somewhat significant that international lending agencies sometimes operate against the interest of developing countries. In this connexion Grenada is fully convinced that the international lending agencies require a fundamental reorganization of their traditional and outdated criteria in evaluating a country's qualifications for borrowing  as well as a reorganization of their policies and their operations. We urge them to take greater cognisance of the political and social realities prevailing in small developing countries and to modify their approach in appraising the needs of such countries. For example  we are often advised to cut expenditure and/or increase revenue in order to achieve a specific objective. In any economy like Grenada's  the scope for increasing revenue is very limited  but when we painfully impose measures for raising the necessary revenue we hear talk of multiple currency practices contravening the philosophy of the agency. This is all confusion and represents an imperfect appreciation of the realities of life in small developing countries.13.	Grenada shares with the emerging peoples of the less developed island nations the plight of small size  openness  lack of mineral resources  scarcity of investment capital for production and an inadequacy of job opportunities. Countries like ours can do little to insulate their economies from the ill effects of world inflation because of the weaknesses of their external sectors and their extreme dependence on the metropolitan countries for both guaranteed prices and financing. Thus  .when the economies of the metropolitan countries become sick and precarious  the economic backlash must essentially manifest itself in budgetary deficits in the small island economies. The mechanisms available to our countries for counteracting those adverse circumstances are severely limited.14.	Invariably the first and foremost suggestion  in most cases a directive  is that expenditure be reduced forthwith.15.	But we know that it is almost suicidal for our people if we cut expenditure to an irreducible minimum. We are riding on the horns of a dilemma because the very aid that we need to help us to undertake programmes which could ensure self-sustaining economic growth is denied us on the basis of per capita income  a criterion which imposes tremendous hardships on developing countries  a criterion which has been ill-conceived and one which is obsolete and inequitable in terms of a realistic view of all the relative circumstances.16.	Grenada is heartened by the commitment given during this General Assembly by many nations to increase their levels of developmental assistance to the developing countries. We discern also in the new policy of the United States a strong desire to take a more lively and meaningful interest in the problems of developing countries  and we might as well take the opportunity now to suggest that in providing technical and economic co-operation   not only the United States of America but any other country should give more consideration than at present to bilateral arrangements  especially among the smaller countries which traditionally get crushed  trampled upon and left in the mire of events while the struggle for the survival of the fittest continues to our great disadvantage. Indeed  it was a straggle  with tremendous odds against us  for Grenada to have acted as host to the seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. However  we did  and it was acclaimed by all concerned that by any standard it was an overwhelming success. I thank God.17.	I wish to take note also of the welcome approach taken by the Secretary-General in inviting richer nations in the international community to act in concert to provide assistance to individual countries with special problems—a form of bilateralism. In a way  such assistance recognizes that a chain is as strong as its weakest link  and that  as we are fully aware; each one of us is his brother's keeper. And in this regard we welcome with distinct pleasure and satisfaction the initiative of the United States Government within our region.18.	As my second contribution today I should now like to touch on the subject of human rights and  because I consider my contribution on this subject at the thirty-first session is of such importance aid of current relevance  I must crave your indulgence  Mr. President  before advancing additional and supportive material  to repeat some of what I said then:""I am submitting  with respect  that it is most urgent and vitally important for the world to take a new look at the concept of human rights""-and specifically to include the equality of women. ""It is my strong feeling that those who propounded the principles of the rights of humanity that culminated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 must necessarily have had completely different ideas from those that seem to prevail in some quarters when one speaks of human rights today. Let me say here and now that human rights must not-I repeat  not—be interpreted as a one-way street for evil individuals and small subversive groups whose aims and objectives are mainly and simply to disrupt the peace and harmony of society in their attempt to overthrow governments and establishments. In regard to their acts of violence  terrorism  vandalism  kidnapping and arson and other criminal acts and threats to the security of society there is always a conspicuously loud silence among individuals and organizations that spontaneously present themselves as advocates and representatives of all such terrorists  criminals  vandals and kidnappers when they come face to face with the law. These individuals and organizations  perhaps too many to mention  seem always to offer themselves as a counsel of solace  thereby abetting the activities of such offenders and giving them and others of their kind encouragement to commit similar crimes. When a Government or Governments take the necessary action to secure and ensure for the majority of their people the human right to enjoy peace of mind  I often wonder whether the organizations  groups and individuals that keep on shouting out for human rights and trying to defame and vilify the character of good Governments ever thought of issuing warnings to those wicked individuals and groups before they actually commit mischief. Human rights must work both ways. When a child is kidnapped  perhaps more than 99 per cent of the population are deprived of its human right to sleep in peace  not knowing whose child will be next. So it is that  when a building is burned or bombed or a man is shot or an aircraft is hijacked or some other acts of violence or vandalism are committed  automatically the human right to peace is infringed or violated. It is in these cases that -.e shouters for human rights should shout  and not the criminals come face to face with the law. Governments are not only stifled in taking preventive measures for the safety and security of life  property and the welfare of all of the people; they are obliged to do so.""'20. But certainly my entire concept of human rights must essentially go beyond these boundaries. Human rights must identify  tackle and solve the problems affecting the basic needs of humanity. It is conceptually fallacious to speak of the right to use a public address system at a time considered not to be in the best interest of a Government or nation and at the same time to overlook man's needs in the areas of shelter—proper housing for himself and his family- clothing  food  education  recreational facilities  religious obligations and freedom of worship  medical and health facilities  the right to work  to earn and to own  and many other areas which rightfully come within the compass of human rights. There is a tendency among many people to confine human rights to civil and political activities.21.	Furthermore  there are many people who have been appointed to serve on human rights commissions and committees who  for fear of reprisals  have never exercised their duties in terms of investigation  evaluation and recommendation with any measure of objectivity. Yes  indeed  there are many people who have formed their own commissions and committees on human rights who are themselves dissidents  delinquents and recalcitrant of the highest order and whose main purpose is to satisfy their own selfish political aspirations. There are others  however  of admittedly high integrity and calibre who have been appointed to committees and commissions but who because of the frailties of man and the fear of reprisals-the fear of being attacked physically or otherwise by dissidents and activist groups—have never been able to give a fair and unbiased picture of the confrontations  the strife and confusion from which have emanated the cries for human rights. Should we here  Members of this Organization  pause for a moment and gather diligently and objectively all the relevant information surrounding the issue of human rights as reported by commissions  committees and the communication media with regard to certain countries of the world today  we would certainly be shocked when government's side of the picture is honestly and comprehensively presented.22.	For some peculiar Governments have always been placed on the defensive  and in this context l am not including the regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia  where there are blatant  gruesome and intolerable violations of human rights. It is very easy for individuals  committees  commissions  groups and even certain institutions to be emotionally intoxicated and to allow the emotions to supersede sound reason and a sense of justice.23.	Brothers and sisters  let us consider ourselves as one big family on "" this planet earth  and let us desist from parsing arbitrary judgement on countries like Chile and others until we are satisfied that we have ourselves properly and objectively investigated without fear or favour all the relevant circumstances from all parties concerned. It is my fervent prayer that Governments  commissions  committees  certain religions  other groups and individuals may refrain from passing judgement on some Governments while they are under the influence of emotional intoxication.24.	My third contribution would be on the subject of wars and conflicts. Grenada  like other nations  recognizes that continued strife among super-Powers  as exemplified by the continued arms race  constitutes a major obstacle to world peace. While we recognize that there has been some softening of the hard line hitherto. taken by the great Powers in respect of disarmament  regrettably we also observe a spreading of the mass race in areas and among countries which hitherto remained outside of this area of friction. This leads to a great waste of resources and significantly obstructs the social and economic well-being of those nations whose main concern  within the international community  is social and economic development and peaceful coexistence. It is a real concern to us inGrenada that billions of dollars are spent every year to promote a dangerous build-up of arms which  in our view  can be more effectively utilized in providing conditions which would narrow the yawning gap between the rich and the poor.25.	In this regard Grenada strongly supports any and all efforts dedicated to disarmament and likewise strongly endorses all statements and efforts in favour of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We were extremely pleased to hear President Carter give the assurance that the United States would exercise the highest degree of caution in the use of nuclear weapons. That promise and his determination to ensure a reversal in the build-up of armaments and the trade in armaments constitute a solemn pledge to this Assembly and the global community generally. It is with extreme joy and profound satisfaction that we have welcomed that solemn pledge to the General I Assembly by President Carter  and I am sure that I am | reflecting the sentiments of all the peace-loving nations of the world in stating that his words will stand as a living [symbol of America's determination to end world tension and provide a sound basis for lasting peace.  May God bless the United States of America for this new thrust and trust our initiative.26. Grenada bemoans the continued struggle of black and disadvantaged races throughout the world for an equal place in society. We cannot tolerate the racial policy of apartheid in South Africa  and we totally abhor the existing situation in Namibia and Zimbabwe and offer full support to the peoples within those countries who are struggling desperately for liberation  as well as to those countries in Africa and elsewhere that are also aiding in the struggle. In this connexion we strongly support the new British initiative for a just settlement  and we are likewise convinced that the United Nations has a legitimate role to play in dealing with this problem.27.	The world has witnessed a continuous striving of peoples for self-determination and territorial integrity. Panama and Belize are two other examples of interest to Grenada. We are happy at the progress made thus far with regard to Panama and the recent signing of an accord  which represents a very historic step in hemispheric relations. It is our hope that all obstacles will be quickly overcome so as to ensure that Belize can assume full sovereignty and take its rightful place in the community of nations.28.	I touch now on my fourth area of concern  a matter which I have been raising in this very chamber since 1975. In 1975 I made mention of the various inexplicable phenomena which continue to baffle even the most advanced branches of science  citing the Bermuda Triangle as one example  and calling upon the United Nations to set up an agency or department for psychic research. In 1976  broadened the scope of my concern to include unidentified flying objects  and called upon the nations of the world to make available to mankind information and other data on this unique phenomenon which lay hidden in national archives. I repeated the call for a United Nations agency or department to be established to study of these phenomena.29.	On those two occasions the members of the General Assembly politely took note of my concerns but  in fact  no United Nations action flowed from my presentations. Meanwhile  I have been literally inundated with letters and communications from individuals  groups and organizations from all over the world  some too modest to come into the open  expressing tremendous interest in the matters I had raised in the United Nations and urging me to continue the initiative in seeking involvement by the United Nations in the way I had suggested.30.	I have myself seen an unidentified flying object  and have been overwhelmed by what I have seen  but my main interest in this matter is not. scientific but essentially political  since I am of the firm belief that this world body should take a legitimate interest in a matter which has aroused general world-wide concern  including that of the leaders of several countries. That concern in unidentified flying objects and related phenomena was more than amply demonstrated and expressed at the First International Congress on the Unidentified Flying Object Phenomenon  held in Acapulco  Mexico  earlier this year  which was attended by over 400 persons  including some of the leading scientists  researchers and authors in the field of the study of unidentified flying objects  and at which I had the pleasure and the privilege of delivering the key address- That group strongly supported my efforts to bring this important subject within the official knowledge of the United Nations  and unanimously endorsed a resolution to that effect. Right now the communications media are agog with interest in the progress we have made in having included on the agenda for this thirty-second session an item calling for establishment of an agency or department devoted specifically to research into unidentified flying objects and related phenomena  which will be discussed in greater detail later in this session by the Special Political Committee. The media are also  understandably  full of excitement and curiosity about the discussion I might have had on this subject with President Jimmy Carter when I had the honour and the pleasure of a 45-minute visit with him on the occasion of the ceremony marking the signature of the Panama Canal treaties.31.	Grenada takes no categorical theoretical stand on the question of unidentified flying objects. Theories as to the nature  origin  and intent of unidentified flying objects are many and are- amply known to civilian and governmental research groups. Irrespective of theory  however  the major research groups are dedicated first and foremost to achieving the following main objectives in their endeavours: to study all significant reports on unidentified flying objects with a view to making a reasonable and acceptable determination of the nature  origin and intent of unidentified flying objects; to disseminate the substantive results of such study to the public and the news media; to work co-operatively with  or within the framework of  the . United Nations to help establish a communications system through which important data can be rapidly exchanged internationally.32.	Research groups are aware of the risks of making a premature judgment at this juncture  knowing that the- constant input of new data on unidentified flying objects  or any single dramatic incident  may trigger a break-through to support any one theory or show evidence that two theories can be unified.33.	Despite the wording of Grenada's item on the agenda  we are prepared to adopt a very flexible posture in this whole matter regarding the item  because we feel that what is important in this case is not so much to foist another agency upon Member nations  with all the ramifications of cost and the like that are involved  but rather to provide an opportunity for open discussion of this matter and the adoption of some resolution which will keep it alive in the General Assembly. Mindful of the experience in other situations-for example  in the preliminary study leading up to the establishment of a committee on the law of the sea  many nations  which now see an agency or department of the United Nations for the study of unidentified flying objects as being too far-reaching an objective to be introduced by little Grenada  may be more easily inclined to give support to a more modest objective: calling for a small ad hoc committee to study the problem and report back to the General Assembly.34.	Many very important United Nations activities grew out of modest beginnings in small ad hoc committees  and somehow I am confident that all nations will lend support to the quest to discover more about unidentified flying objects and related phenomena  thus contributing to the unfolding of important scientific information which has so far continued to baffle man.35.	It is significant to note that it has been reported that two of the super-Powers  those which earlier initiated a joint space programme  have now launched a new cooperative effort to look into the problems of the Bermuda Triangle as well as to discuss the possibilities of life in outer space  against the backdrop of the experience of the astronauts and cosmonauts. These are very significant developments  and  when coupled with the fact that other countries are now beginning to take official cognisance of unidentified flying objects and make public pronouncements about them  it seems quite clear that such objects might not be such a laughing matter after all.36.	I wish now to focus some attention on man  the greatest thing that God has created on this planet earth. But  as I said before  man is afraid to unlock the door to him and so evolve beyond the material  beyond his immediate external environment  and make a thrust beyond earth's orbit. In that context man would more easily appreciate extra-terrestrial existence. And because man is the greatest thing that God has created man must make a search within himself-his inner self—with a view to awakening his inner consciousness and so bringing to light his fullest potentials as his divine heritage. Regrettably  in this regard man has been going through a steady process of degeneration. This could be attributed to various factors- invention  modern gadget-y  perhaps man's greed for material power  for dominion and domination over brother man; or  perhaps  man admits failure before he actually fails and consequently uses his mind as a conductor by which all the elements of failure are induced within his system and the natural sequel is actual failure. Conversely  1 accepts the philosophy that ""what is difficult is that which can be achieved with some effort; what is impossible is that which can be achieved with greater effort"". When we remember that man is the greatest thing that God has created on this planet and  basically  he is everything that he himself has invented  we see that the power of creativity in man is certainly without boundary. But man has lost many of his natural endowments. For while he is greater than any other' creature on this planet  we observe that the cat can see through the dark and man cannot today; the dog  the horse and other creatures of the animal species not only can see but also can sense existences beyond those that man has the capacity to sense. Man is always at war with himself  which is an obstacle to his full in-depth understanding of some of the problems with which we are faced today. Man is inextricably obsessed with the love for power as against the power of love.37.	Science has taken some tentative steps to help in bringing to light some of the secrets of man's inner life  but science itself is so clouded by traditional concepts that the hope for man lies in a redefinition of  and an entirely new thrust in  science such as would recognize the authenticity of psychic research and actively promote such research in the over-all interest of man and mankind.38.	If the ultimate objective of the United Nations is to bring about peace and the happiness of mankind  then it follows quite naturally that the Organization should take a deep and keen interest in the condition of man as an individual person.39.	I wish now to focus my attention on our planet earth. In the light of scientific discoveries it would be more than fallacious to conceive our planet as being the sole and only estate of God's domain. But  since the planet earth is man's natural habitat  it is incumbent upon man to have a full and comprehensive knowledge of our planet in relation to man and in relation to other planets. And speaking here of our planet in relation to man  we must admit that man has not reached out sufficiently to understand and to utilize to the fullest the resources and potential with which our planet is endowed. To a great extent man limits his activities to only a small portion of our planet  and to a great extent man misuses  man wantonly destroys  and in some cases man is guilty of under utilizing our land. And let us not forget that we are talking only of the earth mass  which is approximately only one quarter of our planet.40.	In my opinion it is necessary for us to redirect our scientific  technical and technological skills from constructing destructive weapons and instruments to identifying and multiplying the natural resources and potential of our planet. Today we speak of family planning; today we speak of legalizing abortion; today  as before  we are faced with famine and deprivation. But man must reckon with himself to recognize that on this planet we are simply the guests of a benefactor—the Universal Divine  God  the Great  Supreme Architect. And this God of which I speak is too perfect in goodness  too perfect in love  and  simply  too perfect to cultivate this planet with human species  animals  mammals  birds  reptiles  insects  fish and plant life  among other things  and not provide us  human beings  His greatest creation  with the basic needs and requirements for our existence. In other words  the problem of population explosion is in reality no problem at all: the real problem lies in the improper distribution of our natural resources  the improper utilization of our arable lands and man's failure effectively to identify and harness the wealth of resources yet untapped on the land and in the air  but more particularly in the ocean. We recognize that marine biology and hydroponics and so forth  as they exist today  are but a simple scratch or dent on the surface of the study and utilization of the ocean's resources.41.	In conclusion  I wish to tackle the subject of the universality of God—the concept  acknowledgement and acceptance of our Supreme Being. Last year  in referring to this subject  I said that there was no other subject of greater significance or importance or urgency. Today this is still my irrevocable conviction. I admit that some people are far removed in practice from this subject. Other people deal with God as a part-time enterprise. Some deal with God as a weekly exercise in which they visit with Him in church for an hour or two with a prayer book and then return home and  as it were  place God in a drawer or on a shelf or dressing table—""till next week""  as they may say. It is my fervent prayer that the subject of the Supreme Universal Being  regardless of the name used  should be discussed not only in church and in religious symposia  but in homes  in meetings and conventions  in conferences  and in international organizations  institutions and forums. And in this context I feel that all ceremonies  be they signings of treaties  meetings of minds or others  should commence with the acknowledgement of God and the invocation of His blessings on the event. That is a thought I particularly wish to leave with leaders in various fields of endeavour.42.	Finally  for and on behalf of all of us and in humility I now implore the universal head of the holy cosmic  as I did before: Lord  help us to know who we truly are; Lord  teach us to know ourselves and our potential  help us to use our potential to the fullest extent; Lord  help us to understand better the specific purpose or purposes for which we have been placed on this planet earth and help us to perform our duties and our obligations more promptly  more nobly  more diligently  more effectively  without fear or favour and to Your greater satisfaction and glory.

"54",2888,"GTM",32,1977,"﻿1.	Mr. President  the delegation of Guatemala is pleased to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly and we are certain that your outstanding qualities and diplomatic skills  your experience and thorough knowledge of international problems  as well as your devotion to the ideals of the United Nations  will be decisive factors for the orderly proceedings of our debates and for maintaining the delicate balance of conciliation in the resolutions that will be adopted at this thirty-second session.2.	The delegation of Guatemala is also pleased to express its appreciation to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for the excellent work that he did in guiding the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.3.	My delegation extends to the delegations of the two new Members of our Organization  the  socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  its cordial welcome to this world body and offers them its co-operation in ail undertakings that will contribute to the achievement of the purposes that we share in this universal forum.4.	It is 2 great satisfaction for the delegation of Guatemala to express appreciation for the work done by the Secretary-General of the Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom I had the honour to receive in my country a few months ago  and to-congratulate him on his tireless efforts on behalf of the maintenance of world peace and the strengthening of the mission which has been entrusted to the United Nations. Therefore  on behalf of the delegation which I head  I reaffirm our complete support for his endeavours and initiatives.5.	I shall now refer to some of the items which my delegation considers to be far-reaching and which will be considered at this session.6.	It has become evident in this Assembly that in our debates we attach priority interest to the item of international protection of human rights  which since the signing of the Charter at San Francisco has constituted one of the fundamental purposes of the United Nations.7.	That concern is natural and understandable at a time when  in spite of incredible advances in science and technology  mankind is being harassed by a growing and ruthless wave of violence and by changing forms of civil and international struggle in which the human being is practically defenceless. 8.	The fact that we are here as representatives of the human race is reason enough for this forum to express the unanimous aspiration that the life  integrity and dignity of man should not suffer the abuses of governments or the blind and cruel attacks of terrorism. As representatives of governments  our unanimous aspiration must be translated into action designed to strengthen and develop the legal instruments and institutions required in order to prevent and repress violations of human rights and to guarantee the effective exercise of those rights.9.	The security of the individual must be safeguarded against the excesses of State power. We must ensure the essential conditions of well-being for a dignified and useful life. We must also protect man against the brutal acts of terrorism  which are a threat to the personal integrity and freedom of innocent persons-whether citizens or government officials and diplomatic representatives-who are the victims of indirect action intended to achieve a political objective. Violence and lack of respect for human rights are the result of an interaction of abnormal social forces of which the consequences as well as the deep roots must be combated.10.	The action of the international community must be strongly directed toward preventing and eradicating violence from wherever u comes and whatever its ostensible motivation. Just as individuals must be protected from the excesses of governments  they also must be guaranteed security against the crimes of terrorism. these are two different manifestations of the same disease which afflicts mankind  namely  violence.11.	The Government of Guatemala actively participated in the action undertaken by the United Nations which led to the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which was signed in Paris in 1948  as well  as in the International Covenants which supplement it.12.	Those cardinal principles were incorporated in the Constitution of Guatemala  in its broad protection of individual guarantees and social rights  and are part of our internal legal system.13.	My Government also signed the American Convention on Human Rights  known as the Pact of San Jose  which we helped to frame and which establishes effective agencies for the protection of the observance of those rights at the regional level. That Convention has been submitted for the approval and prompt ratification of our domestic institutions.14.	The Government of Guatemala has at all times considered that the most effective way of ensuring the protection of human rights is through international conventions  both world-wide and regional. Unilateral actions or pressures  however worthy their motives  can always be considered as forms of intervention which are prohibited in relations among States.15.	For more than 25 years  the Government of Guatemala has been in favour of establishing an office ofUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  with responsibility for ensuring that the necessary procedures are followed in order to secure and guarantee respect for those rights.16.	It is the conviction of my Government that the Commissioner  because of his technical competence  would be the proper person to (ill the existing gap which some private associations  whose conclusions are frequently formulated through generalizations or unproven accusations  are seeking to fill more through enthusiasm than equanimity.17.	In conclusion  I wish to state that the delegation of Guatemala will sponsor a proposal to establish the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.18.	With respect to international co-operation  which is one of the most relevant activities of the United Nations  the delegation of Guatemala wishes to express its concern  because the goals and targets set for the United Nations Second Development Decade have in practice not been fully implemented  that is to say  it has not been possible to consolidate a generous policy of co-operation as the only way to achieve universal stability.19.	International  co-operation becomes more essential every day and coexistence in a community of peoples seeking to strengthen peace in the mere absence of conflict is very difficult  because the desired security can be jeopardized as long as two thirds of the peoples of the world still live in conditions of dire insufficiency. The elimination of the scourges which cause such insufficiency must be achieved on a world-wide scale and as a genuine crusade demanding intensive and accelerated common action.20.	The United Nations can have no programme more noble or more promising than the promotion of development  since we live in a world which is forever in movement  with intercommunication made possible by the impressive advance of technology and science  and it is therefore impossible to remain indifferent to the backwardness of innumerable nations  which also leads to situations which are a danger to all. Development beyond and above frontiers and ideologies is a goal that must be achieved as early as possible in order to bring about a more balanced arid harmonious world  in which conditions of well-being are within everyone's reach.21.	The delegation of Guatemala considers it fitting to refer to the failure of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  held this year  because we  as a developing country  had set great hopes on those efforts. The Conference was one of those landmarks in international relations which sometimes do not arouse the attention they deserve  even though this was the first conference convened by the United Nations specifically to negotiate a new instrument which could become a vital part of the new international economic order.22.	The common fund is no great novelty in terms of structural change since it is intended only to assist in the establishment and better operation of international agreements on commodities. What is novel is the plan to add to these arrangements international financing to support and promote agreements on trade.23.	It is regrettable that the Conference was unable to take any specific decision on this very important item  not even on questions of principle. Yet we must not waver in our hope that negotiations on the common fund will continue  because for the developing countries this fund is still a key element in the urgently needed reform of the world economy.24.	My delegation looks forward with optimism to the holding of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries to be held in the spring of next year  since it will constitute a useful forum for the developing countries to share their knowledge and experience.25.	Now the industrial nations must realize the urgent need for them to increase substantially their contributions to development and to achieve structural changes in the international system. This is the true meaning of the interdependence of nations and one of the cardinal points of world peace.26.	In the context of international co-operation for development  the delegation of Guatemala considers it appropriate to express its support for the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development  which represents an important effort of the international community to increase food production throughout the world. The Fund is a scheme in which both industrial countries and the developing countries would participate with specific and far-reaching objectives that would lead to a general improvement in rural activity throughout the world.27.	My delegation considers that  in order to attain development targets  basic conditions must be created that would promote development at all levels  including conditions designed to establish a balance in international trade. To this end the developed countries must apply  improve and expand the system of generalized non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory tariff preferences for the developing countries.28.	It is the unavoidable duty of every State to co-operate to achieve stability in the export prices of the developing countries in relation to import prices  so as to ensure just and equitable terms of trade so that prices will be remunerative for the producer and acceptable to the consumer  with a view to a balanced expansion of the world economy.29.	We must make it clear that international co-operation for development is a shared objective and the common duty of all States  which must all c. operate with the efforts of the developing countries to accelerate their economic and social well-being  with strict respect for the legal equality of States and without conditions that undermine their sovereignty.30.	The Guatemalan delegation recognizes that the Members of the United Nations are co-operating effectively by intensifying the economic and social development of developing countries in many ways. One of its most important instruments is UNDP  and my Government considers its resources should be increased  particularly by the industrial countries  so that UNDP can execute indispensable projects in the poorer nations.31.	As regards the United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea  the Government of Guatemala regrets that the negotiations held so far have been so slow  making it impossible to overcome the obstacles that prevent the signing of an international instrument reflecting the established aims.32.	The delegations of Guatemala expresses its most sincere hope that at the forthcoming sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea Governments will do their utmost to arrive at an international treaty that will finally achieve the global regulation of a subject so vital to the future of mankind.33.	The Government of Guatemala has been striving to establish the mechanisms necessary to accelerate the process of integral development for our people in an atmosphere of peace and with total respect for human rights  within the context of freedom and the complete exercise of democracy.34.	My Government is aware that raising the standard of living of the people of Guatemala depends mainly on our own efforts  but we also recognize that international co-operation is most important within a world development strategy.35.	Since the earthquake which afflicted my country on 4 February 1976 my Government has made a major effort to accelerate the process of national reconstruction without setting aside the execution of projects developed within an organic development plan  acting in conformity with the motto proclaimed by the President of Guatemala  General Kjell Eugenio Laugerud  as the goal of his administration:  To rebuild without ceasing to produce .36.	The international community has been assisting my Government in its arduous task of reconstruction in the devastated areas  and we take the opportunity to reiterate our gratitude in this world forum for that generous co-operation.37.	We reiterate our support for United Nations principles  particularly those which are vital for the harmonious existence of nations  such as sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-intervention  compliance in good faith with international obligations  the promotion of international social justice and international co-operation for development.38.	Throughout its history my country has kept alive its faith in the pacific settlement of disputes among nations. We have proved this in our bilateral relations  and we have defended this principle at the international level.39.	Guatemala  which has actively participated in the United Nations since its foundation  will continue to play its part to the full so that the world Organization may attain the objectives and purposes it has set itself since its inception  and will continue to maintain respect for the principles which led to its establishment.40.	Nevertheless  my Government is concerned because among some of the Members of this world Organization  which is made up of peace-loving States  there still exist  32 years after its foundation  acute situations of conflict which maintain virulent hotbeds of tension in various regions of the planet and threaten the stability of peace in a world that is increasingly interdependent as regards both good and bad fortune41.	We must nevertheless recognize the success of the United Nations in avoiding the possible conflagrations which have loomed ominously over international peaceful coexistence. We should not be discouraged because that success has not included some cases which  regrettably  are still critical  and we must keep our faith that  with goodwill and a shared spirit of sacrifice  just and satisfactory solutions will be arrived at.42.	The delegation of Guatemala expresses its pleasure and reiterates its solidarity with the people of Panama because of the agreements recently signed with the United States of America on the inter-oceanic Canal which meet the desire of that sister nation to obtain more favourable status over 1 the important means of communication which is part of its ' national territory We congratulate both contracting parties for the understanding and conciliatory manner in which  by means of dialogue  they have succeeded in resolving a question that was debated at length and was of world interest  and is particularly of continental interest.43.	The example of the Panama Canal reaffirms our conviction that  with good faith and a spirit of mutual sacrifice among the parties to a dispute  conciliatory formulas can be found which will guarantee relations of peace and  accordingly  relations of friendship and co-operation among peoples. We express the hope that the agreements signed will be approved by the respective constitutional mechanisms of both nations.44.	By means of fruitful negotiations we have practically eliminated the acute problem of the Panama Canal. But on the American continent there still subsist the colonial enclaves of Belize in Guatemala and of the Islas Malvinas in the Argentine Republic which  like the case of Gibraltar in Spain  are painful vestiges of British usurpations in territories extracted from sovereign States at times of boundless imperial expansion.45.	When Guatemala entered the United Nations more than three decades ago  our Government had pending a solution at the international level of its claim over the Guatemalan territory of Belize. In the world Organization we placed our hope for a just and equitable arrangement.46.	For more than a century in vain we have made this claim to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland over that territory occupied by that great Power  and my Government expressed its clear and definite reservation on this on entering the Organization.47.	On many opportunities throughout those 32 years which have elapsed  the Government of my country stated before this forum the historical background and the basis of the just claims of the people of Guatemala over a territory which legitimately belongs to it and of which we were deprived by force.48.	Belize is not an isolated case. It is one of the vestiges of British occupation of Central American lands during the last century when the prospect of building an inter-oceanic Canal over that territory led the Imperial Power to annex major parts of the territories of the States of Honduras  Nicaragua and Costa Rica  which were later returned to their rightful owners through the pressure of international circumstances.49.	At that same time  in 1859  the British occupation of Belize  exceeding the agreed-upon frontiers  extended southward over lands which until then had been under Guatemala's effective sovereignty and occupation. It is from these new occupations and setting of new frontiers that there arose the territorial dispute to which the two Governments are still parties today.50.	As years went by  the population of the Territory of Belize grew  with people coming from different places  and they have swelled the ranks of the resident Guatemalan families. My Government recognizes that the interests and legitimate aspirations of that local population which has developed in Belize must be respected and taken duly into account in any settlement of the dispute which is agreed to between Guatemala and the United Kingdom.51.	Within this political context and in accordance with the fundamental purposes of the United Nations  my Government has been negotiating with the United Kingdom. These negotiations have become more intensive in recent years with a view to finding a conciliatory formula which will at the same time satisfy Guatemala's vital interests and rights and those of the population of Belize which is now under the colonial responsibility of the British Government.52.	In the negotiations which have been held between both Governments very significant advances have been attained  and although some divergences subsist between the parties  we trust that in the near future negotiations will lead to a just  honourable and satisfactory settlement for all.53.	The recent example of the agreement between the United States of America and Panama regarding the Panama Canal  a problem which seemed to be extremely difficult to solve  reaffirms our conviction that there is no dispute between States  however involved  which cannot be settled by peaceful means.54.	This leads us to the optimistic hope that the three problems-those of Belize  the Islas Malvinas and Gibraltar-will soon be solved by means of dialogue and recognition of the validity of those claims.55.	In so far as Guatemala is concerned  my Government wishes to place on record before this august Assembly that we are most willing to continue the negotiating process with the United Kingdom for the purpose of reaching an early settlement to the protracted controversy over Belize.We trust that it is in this same spirit of understanding and equity that the other side will negotiate so as to prevent situations of tension which might arise when a nation finds that its hopes for justice for its legitimate claims are dashed. We also hope that this negotiating process  now being conducted in a friendly climate will not be disturbed by undue pressures from countries alien to the dispute which  far from contributing to the solution of the problem  may render it more acute and complex.56.	With the example of the Panama Canal  we would like to think that the international community is living in an era auspicious for negotiating solutions; and it is on this that we base our hope that  by means of dialogue and understanding  tensions may be alleviated and a solution found for the serious problems of the Middle East  leading to a peace based on the coexistence and brotherhood of man  as well as the reconciliation of the interests of all the peoples of the region.57.	The problem of the reunification of Korea still awaits solution. It too must be settled by peaceful means. My delegation therefore considers that it would be desirable for both South Korea and North Korea to resume the dialogue  at present suspended  so as to achieve a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and  if possible  arrive at a non-aggression pact. Moreover  and as a temporary measure both Koreas  North and South  might be admitted to the United Nations in accordance with the principle of universality enshrined in the very Charter of our Organization.58.	The delegation of Guatemala has spoken on repeated occasions in this Assembly  and we do so now  to condemn the practices of apartheid and other discriminatory policies which keep southern Africa in a perpetually explosive situation. We trust  furthermore  that the problems of Rhodesia and Namibia may be resolved by the peaceful means available under international law  so as to guarantee the human rights of the broad masses of the populations which are now held in thraldom in those territories.59.	Those comments on some of the problems that are before the United Nations for consideration and in respect of which intense activity has been undertaken to find the best solutions prove the constant support of my country for the principles and purposes set out in the fundamental Charter which we signed in San Francisco  California  in 1945. What is more  they are proof of our desire for its correct application without political interpretations that may distort it and that may entail serious threats for international peace and security and for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States Members. We most sincerely hope that the purposes of the Organization at this thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly will be fully met.   		"
"55",2977,"HND",32,1977,"﻿85.	On this particularly auspicious occasion I should like to present to all the members of this Assembly and to the peoples of the world so ably represented here the best wishes of the people and the Government of Honduras.86.	I wish in particular to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Mojsov  Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia  on his well-deserved election as President. We are well aware  Mr. President  of the dynamic role your country has played in the international arena in the past few decades  and we are familiar with your personal contribution. Our congratulations go also to Mr. Amerasinghe  who so ably carried out his important functions as President of the General Assembly in a year which was particularly important for the United Nations.87.	My country welcomes the admission of two new Members to the United Nations: The Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. We greet them warmly and wish to express to them our feelings of friendship and solidarity.88.	The United Nations came into being at the end of the Second World War and unquestionably it has been an expression of the fondest hopes of the peoples of the world for the creation of lasting peace for everyone on the basis Of sovereign equality and international co-operation. The United Nations today constitutes the best forum for raising and solving the problems besetting nations. It offers us eloquent proof of what can and should be achieved through dialogue for the benefit of mankind.89.	We have faith in the United Nations. By strengthening it we are laying the groundwork for world peace and we are giving substance to the hope for a better future for the peoples of the world. All countries represented here have an excellent opportunity to realize fully their potential  to join forces to prevent war and to strengthen international justice.90.	My Government believes that within this Organization the nations of the world must direct their efforts to two fundamental and indissolubly linked objectives: peace and development.91.	There must be world harmony  but it will be difficult to achieve without high levels of economic growth and social well-being for the more than two thirds of the people of the world who are living in a state of abject poverty. The United Nations must therefore maintain peace with justice and  faced with this immense task  its role as a great conciliator will increase  and in future years its success will largely depend on the progress made in the area of justice among nations and development.92.	There have been many changes in the international arena in the past few years  and in this constantly changing world of ours there must be respect for the principles which should underlie international relations and which have been often proclaimed by our Organization over the past three decades. Not only is this the right time to reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Charter; this is the time for performance and for achievement. It is a matter of urgency that we overcome the economic and political obstacles to a climate of peaceful coexistence based on a harmonious and balanced development of the international community that will end situations of great inequality  substitute dialogue for confrontation  recognize the interdependence of the peoples of the world and associate the developed and developing countries in prosperity and freedom. We believe that it is only by overcoming economic and political obstacles that we can guarantee peace and well-being for present and future generations of the world in which we live. It is towards these goals that we must strive.93.	Honduras is a peace-loving nation and it respects its international commitments. We hope that in our part of the world  Central America  renunciation of the use of force as a means of settling differences will be a guiding principle in our international conduct.94.	I should like to reiterate on this occasion our determination to achieve an early and satisfactory settlement of the dispute that has in the past few years divided my country and the Republic of El Salvador. We believe that the mediation agreement concluded under the auspices of the Organization of American States on 6 October 1976 will be a decisive element in a final settlement  if both sides so agree. We expect that on 22 November next the procedure laid down will be initiated and can lead us eventually to the restoration of the peace and the cordial relations which should exist between peoples that are linked together by history and geography. We shall go to the negotiating table without any prejudgement and with our minds open to whatever solutions may be proposed for the settlement of the dispute  and we invite the nations represented here  and the Organization itself  to follow closely and support our efforts to bring back peace and harmony to Central America.95.	That has been our traditional position. That is also our hope with regard to other conflicts dividing friendly countries.96.	It is with good reason that my Government has viewed with concern the crisis which has recently arisen between Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the territory of Belize. My country wishes to express its support for a negotiated settlement of the problem.97.	Honduras believes that in the solution of this problem the historical and legal data on which the Guatemalan claims are based and the universally recognized principles of international public law that guarantee for the parties a solution that will take account of their fundamental interests  must not be disregarded.98.	In accordance with the Guatemalan statement of 25 August of this year  my Government reiterates its satisfaction at the decision of the Governments of Guatemala and the United Kingdom to resolve the problem of Belize in accordance with the method of the peaceful settlement of international disputes established by international law in such a way as to find a negotiated solution which will reconcile the rights of Guatemala and the interests of the people of Belize.99.	Pursuing the same line of thought  I must say that the Government and people of Honduras welcomed with satisfaction the signing of the Panama Canal treaties between the United States of America and Panama. Honduras interprets this as the expression of a new attitude and a new desire on the part of the United States of America to understand Latin America sympathetically  to work with and respect us in meeting the challenges of the world of the present day. Force must no longer be used but must be replaced by interdependence and considerations of mutual benefit.100.	It is our earnest hope that the dispute between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the Malvinas Islands will be resolved taking account of the historical and legal rights underlying the position of the Argentine Republic. We are confident that the talks which took place in Rome in May of this year between the representatives of the two nations will make a positive contribution to the settlement of the problem. The reopening of the dialogue is proof of the mature and responsible manner in which the Governments concerned have approached the settlement of the problem. We also hope that Spain  rejuvenated and vibrant  will conclude its negotiations on Gibraltar with the United Kingdom.101.	For the reasons already stated  my country has followed with interest the negotiations between the Governments of Bolivia  Chile and Peru relating to the land-locked status of the first. While sympathizing fully with Bolivia's predicament  we believe that the countries concerned will be able to reconcile their positions so that  in accordance with the historic Declaration of Ayacucho  the dialogue will continue and lead to the best possible solution in accordance with the aspirations of those brotherly peoples.102.	The efforts which have been made to maintain peace throughout the American continent strengthen our confidence in the inter-American system and its machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We note that similar arrangements exist in other parts of .the world with regard to pending problems  the solution of which is not impossible.103.	Consequently my Government views with satisfaction the prospects for the resumption in Geneva of negotiations on peace in the Middle East. The diplomatic actions of friendly nations lead us to hope that there will be at the negotiating table representatives of all the parties concerned. The United Nations has played and should continue to play an important role in the maintenance of peace in the Middle East  and resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) adopted on the subject by the Security Council take account of the interests at stake and should serve as a basis for lasting peace in that part of the world. Honduras cannot fail to reaffirm its hope that in regard to this international problem as to others the principles of the United Nations Charter will be respected.104.	My Government joins the international community in urging the provision of assistance to the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe in order to ensure that they speedily obtain majority government and independence by peaceful means.105.	We also hope that there will be genuine progress in the talks on Cyprus which are being held in Vienna with the participation of the United Nations. The best tribute to the memory of Archbishop Makarios would be the achievement of an equitable solution of the complex problems of that country  which relate to its territorial integrity.106.	Today more than ever before the future of mankind depends on our being able to reconcile the different interests in the international community. Honduras places its faith in continuous negotiations  open dialogue and permanent co-operation. No matter how widely separated positions may seem to be  my country believes that at the present time no international conflict can remain unresolved indefinitely.107.	Reviewing the principal international problems  Honduras is particularly pleased that in most cases the world has chosen the only acceptable civilized way of settling disputes among nations—namely  the peaceful way  which my country traditionally  clearly  sincerely and unswervingly supports.108.	I am expressing the feelings of the people and Government of my country when I say that it is our hope that the outstanding problems to which I have referred will be. solved speedily and appropriately in accordance with the principles of international respect and harmony.109.	Any conflict requires the diversion to armaments of the resources needed to provide better living conditions for man. Unquestionably  the settlement of international disputes would release a large part of those resources. We are hoping for ever more radical changes in this field because never before has so much been spent on armaments in time of peace. But mankind must not only desire but must move firmly towards general and complete disarmament.110.	Because it is contrary to our way of thinking  we are particularly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing danger of the use of nuclear energy for warlike and destructive purposes. The security supposedly created by an arms race has in fact been destroyed by the very existence of these death-dealing weapons. The enormous sums of money spent on arms make us think that the world's development depends largely on halting the arms race. The world community can no longer continue to harness human genius to the invention of the means of its own destruction. With a quarter of the resources spent in one year on research on and the production of armaments we could carry on a significant struggle against under-development and social injustice in Asia  Africa1 and Latin America.111.	My country hopes that at the next special session of the General Assembly while will be devoted to disarmament significant progress will be made and that the role of the United Nations in achieving this priority objective will be strengthened; otherwise the declarations and covenants which state that international society was created by and for man will have no meaning.112.	In the sphere of human rights our position has been  is and will continue to be one of strict respect for those rights. We believe that the problem of human rights is a challenge to the international community. There can be no respect for human dignity when we do not fight hunger  low. levels of health  illiteracy  inequality and injustice. My Government is trying to bring about substantial! reforms with a view to furthering economic  social and political development in my country. We are particularly interested in social development-to benefit the overwhelming majority of the population of my country.113.	In September Honduras became the fourth country to deposit with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States its instrument of ratification of the American Convention on Human Rights  which was signed in San Jose  Costa Rica  on 22 November 1969. By so doing  my Government wishes to emphasize the importance which it attaches to this subject.114.	We hope there will be an analysis of the situation of human rights throughout the world  with special reference to the close relationship between under-development and respect for human rights. We believe that respect for human rights is a problem which cannot be taken up solely from a national standpoint. We believe that international relations play a most important role in the observance of human rights and that both the industrial nations and those striving for development have a responsibility which cannot be avoided. For that reason  my country supports Costa Rica's proposal for the establishment of the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.115.	Political terrorism  which is non-existent in our country  is a source of great concern to the Honduran people  particularly because of' the harm that violence has caused throughout Central America. Those acts  which have proliferated over the past few years  deserve a detailed and thorough analysis of their causes and motives and drastic action on the part of the international community.116.	We are well aware of the efforts that the United Nations has made to arrive at decisions aimed at eliminating this problem completely. It is unquestionably a threat to the integrity of the human person.117.	My country greatly regrets that  halfway through the second part of the twentieth century  the policy of apartheid continues to exist  for it negates the principles of the Charter and constitutes a real crime against humanity. The indifference with which the various resolutions of our Organization have been greeted should lead us to reconsider collective action against that particular odious form of segregation. For that reason  my country will continue unreservedly to support whatever action is taken to eliminate the policy of apartheid once and for all.118.	Regarding the problems relating to the law of the sea  Honduras hopes that  with wisdom  nations will be able to remove the dangers that threaten the conservation and exploitation of the resources of the sea  which is the common heritage of mankind. In the coming years  we will have to resort more and more to the sea as an important source of food and mineral resources. The conferences that the United Nations has convened on the law of the sea should give the world rules and regulations ensuring the rational and equitable exploitation of such resources  the freedom of navigation  agreement on the delimitation of various maritime areas under national sovereignty and control  effective means to prevent the pollution of the seas  and the rights of States to conduct scientific research in the various zones. All such arrangements should  of course  have due regard for the inalienable right of the developing countries to dispose freely of their natural resources.119.	My country established its sovereignty over the continental and insular shelf and superajacent waters out to a distance of 200 miles from our coast  in Decree No. 96 of 26 January 1950  which was issued during the administration of Mr. Juan Manuel Galvez. Our rights were reaffirmed in the Declaration of the Honduran Foreign Ministry of 17 June 1974  wherein Honduras' right was stated as follows: ""to exploit the living and mineral resources in a 200-mile zone  in accordance with the principles proclaimed for the first time in the Galvez Declaration of 1950"".120.	This is perhaps an appropriate time also to say that recently the twenty-fifth anniversary of the historic Declaration of the South Pacific was put forward. While recognizing the special features of the position put forward by the brotherly countries of Chile  Peru and Ecuador  we must recognize their contribution to the fight being waged by developing countries to maintain their rights over the sea.121.	This struggle cannot be separated from the international undertaking to bring about a new international economic order. We fully support the philosophy of the United Nations that there should be new relations of co-operation based on equity  sovereign equality and the common interests of States. My country hopes that effective action will be taken to rectify existing injustices. We must set aside whatever resentful feelings we may have which may cloud our action  and we must substitute co-operation for confrontation. The countries of the third world must speedily overcome the present vulnerability of their economies  the chronic deficits in their foreign trade balances  and the lack of funds they need for integrated development. These objectives can only be achieved in a climate of harmony and with the understanding of industrial countries. The  dialogue begun in Paris during The Conference on International Economic Co-operation should be pursued and continued within the United Nations.122.	It would be disastrous for the world to close out the possibilities of discussion and effective co-operation concerning energy conservation  rational use of energy  energy supplies and the search for new sources of energy  as well as the help that should be given to the developing countries that do not. produce oil and whose economies have been seriously affected by the recent rise in the price of energy.123.	The establishment of a common fund for stabilization of commodity prices might be one result of the Paris Conference. This co-operation should be extended to the search for effective means to ensure competitiveness between natural and manufactured products and to ensure better marketing and distribution of raw materials  diversification of exports  the opening of new markets for traditional products  and the improvement of the generalized system of preferences and of bilateral trade conditions.124.	Negotiations regarding tropical products in the Tokyo round of GATT negotiations ran into the same sort of impasse as in other areas  despite the urgent-label attached to the conclusion and implementation of an agreement on the subject.125.	Attention must be given to development aid programmes and to increasing co-operation in the areas of agriculture  food and health. Similarly  in the areas of industrial development  infrastructure and the transfer of technology  my country feels there should be machinery to make more flexible and regulate relations based on mutual advantage  bearing in mind the special needs of the developing countries.126.	UNDP has fortunately overcome the crisis .which threatened it last year  but it cannot be said that its future is completely secure. It has done most useful work  for which Honduras would like to express its appreciation once again; it should continue to receive increased funds  to administer them judiciously  and to adopt new machinery such as joint projects and bilateral sources of assistance.127.	Other United Nations funds should also co-ordinate their policies with those of UNDP  and all of them should always adhere to the principle of universality in their allocations. The specialized agencies of the United Nations should not only be able to use the resources of UNDP  but they should begin really to supplement them with funds from their regular budgets which  despite the financial difficulties affecting them at the present time  should be more oriented to development assistance.128.	We cannot fail to mention the importance which Honduras attributes to co-operation among developing countries  especially to forms of economic integration based on a just distribution of benefits and sacrifices. We also attach importance to achieving broader objectives and broader membership  and this would apply to the Latin American Economic System  from which my delegation expects great achievements.129.	We believe that the time has come for the peoples of the third world unhesitatingly to increase their efforts to improve their future in the economic and social areas. We hope that they will in this way play their part in the concert of nations. The results of this would be that the new human spirit we all hope for. will indeed emerge and there will be a respect for man wherever he may be in the world.130.	I should not like to conclude my statement without expressing warm and respectful appreciation to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for his wisdom and dynamism as Secretary- General.131.	I wish to express the hope of the people and Government of Honduras that the debates of this Assembly will be directed towards the finding of solutions which will guarantee peace among nations  so that man's great adaptability and imagination will be used to overcome the obstacles to the development of all the peoples of the world.132.	Today  when we no longer believe that negotiations on a world-wide basis should be marked by sterile rhetoric; today  as we try to go beyond the more inglorious moments of human history  using our knowledge of what we have been and of what we are and with faith in a future that will confirm the prodigious changes wrought by man for man through progress in science and technology  we wish to reaffirm our adherence to the principles of the legal equality of States  of territorial integrity  of the self- determination of peoples and of respect for human rights. We proclaim our belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes  in non-intervention  in international co-operation  in the permanent and full sovereignty of each State over its natural resources. We condemn the use of force and armed aggression. We repudiate foreign domination and occupation  discrimination in any form and the exploitation and degradation of man by man. That is our credo."
"56",3046,"HTI",32,1977,"﻿313.	 Mr. President  I have the honour on behalf of the Haitian delegation to offer you my cordial congratulations on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. This choice is bound to lend a special dynamism to the work of the thirty-second session  at which our Organization will face urgent and important problems. My delegation assures you of the same co-operation which it gave your eminent predecessor  whom we salute respectfully on the occasion of his departure.314.	We offer the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  both our tribute and our congratulations for his indefatigable efforts on behalf of the cause of the United Nations.315.	The Haitian delegation is pleased to welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam which has  at the cost of enormous sacrifices  succeeded in recovering its unity and its sovereignty.316. We are also pleased that our sister Republic of Djibouti has succeeded in achieving its independence  and we are .convinced that it will know an era of peace and prosperity marked by the unity of all its children.317.	Among the issues before this session of the General Assembly  that of human rights is of particular importance for my delegation. Our interest in this question stems from the fact that my country was born out of its claims and struggles for human rights. Therefore  no lesson whatsoever on any matter that could help to promoting human dignity can be foreign to us. Our history  like that of other peoples  has known vicissitudes which have sometimes forced us to take exceptional measures to respond to equally exceptional situations. Nevertheless  we have never stopped believing in the permanent place of human rights in the lives of nations. Very few States can declare that they have not at any time in their history experienced difficult moments which have forced them to suspend some articles of their basic Constitutions  which have been restored as soon as the crisis which made necessary the temporary suspension of these constitutional safeguards was ended.318.	Our country has entered a new phase of its existence. The people of Haiti have understood that the unity and the mobilization of all the country's vital energies are essential if it is to cope successfully with the ever more urgent problems facing the nation. Therefore  the Haitian Government  under the wise leadership of its President-for-Life  His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier  concerned with facilitating national reconciliation  has felt that certain measures aimed at ensuring the maintenance of Haiti's peace and national integrity were no longer necessary. Thus the decision has been taken to normalize the conditions of our daily life.319.	Today  we can affirm that we do not have a single political prisoner in our prisons. We have appealed to the patriotism of our former adversaries to join with us in the great war to be waged against hunger  disease  illiteracy  unemployment  and so on  within the framework of our laws and that of human rights.320.	A series of measures have been taken and the Haitian Government has  inter alia  just acceded to the American Convention on Human Rights  also known as the Pact of San Jose  Costa Rica  and plans to invite the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS to visit Haiti on a date convenient to it so that it may take note on the spot of the positive developments in the situation which have taken place in the political  economic and social sectors. Among other things  the Legislative Chamber of Haiti  on the proposal of the Executive Branch  has just passed a law establishing a Tribunal of State Security where  in accordance with our Constitution  civilians accused of crimes against the security of the State will be judged by civilians. All these are actions which demonstrate my Government's clear desire to promote the cause of human rights.321.	One of the most important events of this year for us in Latin America remains the solution of the Panama Canal problem.322.	The entire Haitian people celebrated the signing of agreements between the United States and the Republic of Panama which confer a new status upon the Canal. We are all the more pleased at this event since at one moment in our history  the building of the Canal had repercussions in Haiti. Indeed  it contributed to a very great extent to the American occupation of Haiti in the name of the ""need to defend that important line of communication. We join with the people of Panama in welcoming the results of the negotiations which have led to the changes made in the previous Treaty.323.	We should like to believe that the conclusion of the new treaty will usher in a new stage in the relations between Latin America and the United States  a stage which seems to lay the basis of a new approach in their foreign policies.324.	All of us in the Americas feel that this fact marks the end of a system which long held sway-even for too long-and which delayed the development of more harmonious relations between our nations and their powerful northern neighbour.325.	The Republic of Haiti is deeply disturbed by the course of events which in southern Africa  in the Middle East and Cyprus are endangering world peace  closely linked as it is to improved living conditions for the peoples of the third world.326.	The Haitian Government remains deeply concerned at the explosive situation prevailing in Namibia and in Zimbabwe. It fully endorses the Maputo Declaration because of the support which this document gives these peoples and reaffirms its solidarity and backing for the struggle being waged by the liberation movements. We are following with sustained interest the Anglo-American initiatives and the Security Council debates aimed at finding an early solution to the conflict affecting that part of the world. We feel that everything possible must be done to ensure the full success of these steps. However  if these should fail  the Security Council and  with it  the entire international community will have to be prepared to face their responsibilities  using all the means available to them under the United Nations Charter to restore to the African peoples  those victims of so many injustices  the full range of their rights to equality  dignity and happiness.327.	In the meantime  the valiant freedom fighters will ensure and must ensure that their vigilance shall never be found lacking. We believe that in the final analysis it is they who will have to resolve the dispute through the force of their arms. We are convinced that the international community will continue to furnish them the material  moral and political assistance which will permit them to attain their final goal.328.	My Government is also disturbed by the situation of our brothers in South Africa who in their own country are living in a situation bordering on slavery. The human tragedy of apartheid has been condemned by all men of goodwill. We condemn any form of discrimination based upon race  religion or nationality. We support unreservedly the Lagos Declaration on Apartheid and we should like to express the hope that the programme of action recommended therein will be strictly observed by all members of the international community. This will make it possible for us in the not-too-distant future to welcome here a genuine South African delegation which will represent the majority of the population.329.	The Haitian delegation welcomes the Soviet- American statement on the Middle East issued on 1 October and hopes for the prompt convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. We congratulate the Governments of those two States Members of the United Nations for the spirit of understanding and co-operation which they have just shown in accordance with their responsibility as permanent members of the Security Council  the main mission of which is to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security. This sense of duty which they have shown cannot but contribute to restoring the prestige of the Council and at the same time it will make it possible for us to perceive the dawn of an era of lasting peace in that region  the peoples of which have too often been victims of the scourge of war.330.	In this regard  we think on the one hand that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973)  although subject to different interpretations  offer the best framework for negotiations and  on the other hand  that all parties concerned must be represented. Otherwise  we risk not achieving a generally accepted agreement. In the meantime  the parties to the conflict should attempt to refrain from any action which might impede the negotiating process.331.	It is crucial that peace return to this part of the world and we believe that the parties to the dispute will be the first to benefit from this.332.	Regarding the Republic of Cyprus  we deplore the fact that a formula for reconciliation has so far not been found by the parties to the conflict which would make it possible for them to unite above and beyond all conceivable differences in a larger community: their motherland. The United Nations will have to ensure that new initiatives be taken to resume the negotiations. For our part we shall support all solutions adopted by the parties themselves  without any outside pressure.333.	My delegation would like to stress that its position on the question of Cyprus does not constitute derogation from either the principle of self-determination or from that of respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States. These principles constitute the corner-stone of the foreign policy of the Haitian Government. We consider Cyprus to be a special case which recalls in many respects the situation of the island of Haiti  which we share with the Dominican Republic. We remain firmly devoted to the principle of self-determination and the right of all peoples to national independence. Any attempt on the part of certain States  whether or not they are former colonies  to recolonize young newly independent States or those soon to become independent  will not be endorsed by the Republic of Haiti.334.	My delegation is also pleased with the inclusion on the agenda of the thirty-second session of an item on the non-use of force in international relations  and it intends to work in the coming days in close co-operation with the other interested delegations in order to achieve the framing of a draft convention on that subject. We see no reason not to endorse such steps  because actually we ourselves  we Haitians  have no force to which we could conceivably resort  apart from the fierce will of our peopleto resist aggression wherever it may come from. With the formal acceptance of such a principle through a convention  the need for the arms race  which is swallowing up so much of the resources that could be used for humanitarian purposes  will disappear.335.	In regard to the question of the law of the sea  my delegation deeply regrets the absence of real progress in the negotiations and it reaffirms its devotion to the principle of the common heritage of mankind: It urges the industrialized countries to demonstrate  at the next session  more understanding and a greater desire for co-operation  so that a treaty may be arrived at without undue delay.336.	On the national level  my Government  exercising its full sovereignty  opened in Port-au-Prince  in the period from 10 to 14 August 1977  the first phase of the negotiations between the Republic of Cuba and Haiti on the demarcation of the exclusive economic zone of the two States. At the end of this month the representatives of the two Governments are to meet in Havana to finalize the agreement in this regard.337.	After more than three decades of ceaseless debate of the question of the economic development of the third world countries  the United Nations will have no trouble in summing up what has been accomplished because  despite the proliferation of organizations  negotiations and international arrangements  the problems of the underdeveloped countries still demand  even more urgently  the attention and concerted action of the industrialized world.338.	These problems remain with us in all their gravity  and their solutions seem to depend much more on the high degree of understanding and global dialogue ushered in by the new international order than on the national policies of governments formulated and carried out in isolation.339.	Therefore the Haitian Government wishes to express its regret that the last Conference on International Economic Co-operation did not lead to the structural changes required by the international economic system and did not offer certain immediate solutions to pressing problems confronting the third-world countries.340.	So far it has not been possible to find any acceptable solution to the problem of the fluctuation of commodity prices  which affects the development process. Generally speaking  attempts made to improve the position of the countries producing raw materials and to provide them with outlets on the world market have been quickly neutralized by the consumer countries.341.	As far as the commodity prices are concerned  they have recently risen sharply. Unfortunately  not all the developing countries benefit from this to the same degree. Some of them  including my own country  are in a situation where this price increase in commodities means merely an increase in the prices of manufactured products  whether consumer products or capital goods. The producers have quickly passed on the increases to the consumers. As a result the developing countries with very few commodities to export or engaged in the export of products the foreign market demand for which is weak  find their trade deficits increased. For those countries that are near bankruptcy asan immediate consequence of this increase  it means that appropriate measures should be taken immediately to make it possible for them not only to reduce the immense deficit they face now in their balance of payments but also to diversify and expand the bases of their economies  in order to facilitate the growth of their exports and make them more competitive on the world market. They would thus be able to obtain the currency they badly need for financing their development plans. Only in this way will they be able to break out of the vicious circle of chronic underdevelopment and for the first time to enjoy an even relative degree of economic independence. This assistance  whatever form it may take  will be acceptable provided that it is not accompanied by conditions prejudicial to the integrity and political sovereignty of the States concerned.342.	The increase in commodity prices is not the only factor responsible for the exorbitant prices of manufactured goods. Mention has been made of the cost of the processing of raw materials into semi-manufactured and manufactured goods  without stressing the present inflationary wage policy. It is high time the developed countries recognized that in the present situation it is no longer possible for poor countries to continue to subsidize the standard of living of the populations of the rich countries. One way of obviating this difficulty would be to encourage local processing of raw materials  as this would be of considerable help in overcoming or at least reducing the effects of paralysing endemic unemployment.343.	Another factor which also has an impact on the increase in the prices of manufactured products is the high cost of shipping. Here  too  the industrialized countries enjoy a de facto monopoly which makes it possible for them from one day to the next to increase the already exaggerated prices in this area of maritime transport.344.	Not only are these prices arbitrary  they are very often discriminatory. The specious pretext of the profitability of certain routes as compared with others makes it possible for them to impose lower prices on routes between industrialized countries and higher ones on routes linking industrialized and developing countries  with very little importance attached to the factor of distance. This is a truly unjust situation which must be remedied.345.	The increase in petroleum prices has disrupted national economies to such an extent that it deserves to be considered separately. Its consequences on the Haitian economy have been immediate and particularly trying. Last year Haiti paid approximately SI6 million more for the same quantity of petroleum as it bought the previous year. This is equivalent to half the total of foreign aid it received during that same year. Faced with this situation and to avoid general stagnation  the Haitian Government took prompt measures to reduce the tax on petroleum imports  thus helping out the consumers and particularly the low income groups most affected. This action by the Haitian Government  although it reflects the determination of the Government to maintain the standard of living of its population  will cost our treasury a great part of the income which could have been used to finance investments in the public sector. That situation continues to demand greatsacrifices of my country. We have accepted them willingly  because we feel that the claims of those third-worldoil-producing countries are just. In return  we hope that those countries will be able  as rapidly as possible  to develop a plan for aid to the developing countries  giving priority to those whose need is greatest.346.	By the same token  it would be well for the countries having a surplus of capital to give investment preference to the developing countries. That would enable them  first  to contribute to the rapid raising of the living standards of the populations of those countries by reducing unemployment rates; secondly  not to participate in the total deterioration of the environment seen in the developed countries  which are already victims of over-industrialization; and  thirdly  to demonstrate their solidarity with their less fortunate brothers of the third world.347.	As if the picture were not sufficiently gloomy  an acute food crisis is currently being felt in various areas of the world. This is largely the result of adverse climatic conditions affecting the environment. While some of those countries will be able  as these conditions change  to regain their former productivity  others  such as the Sahelian countries  which have been so gravely affected  run the risk of reaching the point of no return unless the international community  FAO  WHO and non-governmental institutions speedily grant them the necessary aid and assistance.348.	Finally  in other countries where traditional  archaic production methods have remained the same  the earth is unable to feed an ever-growing population. Hence it has become necessary for rich lands to be cultivated more intensively and for poor areas not yet cultivated to be exploited through the application of modern agricultural techniques. Developed as well as developing countries  in co-operation with FAO and the International Development Association  will have to create the necessary conditions for the development of that land.349.	For its part  the Haitian Government has embarked on a vast programme of agricultural expansion providing for the intensive utilization of fertilizers  the more extensive use of agricultural machinery and the irrigation of thousands of hectares of unirrigated land.350.	In any case  we feel that the problem of the shortage of agricultural products on a world scale cannot and will not be solved without the establishment of an international plan for production and consumption with the participation of FAO.351.	One factor that could undermine the results of an international agricultural policy is the world population growth  which will have to be controlled by a strict national population policy  with the assistance of the international agencies concerned.352.	Two of the most urgent problems confronting the world economy  which have had particularly disastrous effects upon the economies of the developing countries  are monetary instability and inflation. The system of floating currencies in which the developing countries keep their reserves has been a harmful one  because of the uncertainty it creates in international trade and in the over-all development of developing countries. There can no longer by any doubt that the present monetary system has been unable to meet the expectations of the developing countries. The increased volume of world trade which it was aimed at promoting has benefited only the developed countries.353.	IMF must be reconstituted by according greater participation to the developing countries at the decision-making level. Finally  it is important that measures be taken to guarantee international monetary stability. This stability  I must say  will not be sufficient to redress the trade balance between rich and poor countries. That will be achieved only by reviewing the entire system of international trade relations  and eliminating protective measures  such as prohibitive taxes  quota and preference systems  and so forth.354.	We are far from believing that these goals which we have outlined here are easy to attain. To assume so would be to underestimate the scope of the task. We know that it is a tremendous one. However  it is not beyond our capabilities; it merely calls upon all our physical  intellectual  moral and economic resources.355.	In conclusion  the Haitian Government would reaffirm its loyalty to the principles of the United Nations Charter  and its trust in the reason and wisdom of the representatives here assembled. We are convinced that with their goodwill these problems which at first sight seem insoluble will gradually be solved to the satisfaction of all mankind."

Mr. President  on behalf of the Hungarian delegation may I warmly congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly during its thirty-second session. I am particularly happy to see our present session presided over by an outstanding representative of a neighbourly and friendly country—Yugoslavia.25.	I take this opportunity to extend  on behalf of my Government and of the entire Hungarian people  heartfelt congratulations to the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on having finally assumed its rightful and legitimate place in the United Nations. As I wish the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam every success in its activity  may I also voice my firm conviction that the active participation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in the work of our world Organization will be a significant contribution to enhancing the effectiveness and authority of the United Nations.26.	I should also like to welcome the delegation of the Republic of Djibouti and to wish that newly independent State every success in its activity within the world Organization.27.	In November of this year one of the greatest events in human history will be commemorated throughout the world. It was 60 years ago that the Great October Socialist Revolution emerged victorious and ushered in the era of fundamental changes in the life of peoples  changes that marked a radical turnabout setting in motion the inexorable process of moulding the shape of a new world. With this great anniversary drawing near  I extend  on behalf of my Government  warmest greetings to the delegation of the Soviet Union and hope that the Soviet people will score further brilliant successes in building communism and fighting for stronger peace and security. The people of my country  which was among the first to respond to the message of the Great October  has remained and will remain true to the ideals of the revolution and lives in indissoluble bonds of friendship with the peoples of the Soviet Union.28.	The international activities of the Hungarian People's Republic continue to serve the quest for a lasting peace and a more stable security. We are glad to know that a similar policy is being pursued by the friendly socialist countries  as well as by countries of a socialist orientation and other progressive governments. Such endeavours can take a great deal of the credit for the advancement of peaceful coexistence and of detente.29.	The prevalence of detente has done much to expand co-operation among countries with different social systems  to bring the process of decolonization into its final phase  to consign to oblivion dictatorial regimes that were once believed to be perpetual  and to help certain acute hotbeds of crisis reach settlement. The climate of detente helps make progress also in the difficult issues of disarmament and other questions.30.	This is perhaps just what the opponents of detente find too much—something that they cannot  of course  openly admit and therefore choose to blur. Yet it is not difficult to discern the true endeavours of the opponents of detente  who are again attempting to drag out the hackneyed and abortive concept of the policy of force and want to obtain military supremacy in an attempt to squeeze political concessions from the socialist and other progressive countries. Prompted by this motive  they seek to introduce into international relations such so-called new elements which actually serve to hold back the process of detente. In pursuit of their goals they openly interfere in the internal affairs of others  primarily the socialist countries.31.	All of these phenomena cause legitimate concern and anxiety to those who have a sincere interest in extending detente and international co-operation. My Government takes satisfaction from the fact that  in addition to a wide range of States  hundreds of millions of working people- workers  peasants and intellectuals—are adopting an increasingly forceful stand against efforts that pose a threat to detente. This  too  is an important contributory factor to the optimism with which the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is looking to the future  in spite of the unsatisfactory aspects of the prevailing situation32.	The aforementioned attempts by the opponents of detente cannot be viewed with indifference by the United Nations. We regard as highly topical  and warmly welcome  the fact that at the initiative of the delegation of the Soviet Union  the General Assembly included in the agenda of its thirty-second session the item ""Deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war"" 33.	Each and every country has a share of the responsibility to bear in the strengthening of peace and security and in the extension of detente. It is indisputable  however  that in these efforts a special responsibility is incumbent on the great Powers. We are all aware of the outstanding role played by the improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America in setting into motion the process of detente. The pattern of widening co-operation  which began to emerge between those two large countries in the early 1970s  contributed substantially to the settlement of some complicated international problems. And now the opponents of detente are sniping at the results and the future of detente  principally by scheming to impair Soviet-American relations.34.	The expansion of bilateral relations between the other socialist and capitalist countries is similarly of great importance in the efforts to strengthen peace and security. My Government's awareness of this is indicated by the high-level meetings and successful talks it has arranged with other countries. Of particular relevance in this regard are the highly productive visits by Janos Kadar  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and member of the Presidential Council of the People's Republic  to Austria  Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany. We shall adhere to this policy in the future as well.35.	Recent years have seen particularly great strides towards peace and security in Europe. My Government devotes especial attention to strengthening peace and expanding co-operation in Europe  and it has taken a whole series of practical steps to give full effect to the principles and recommendations contained in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We consider the Belgrade meetings  which opened just a few days ago  an important stage in this process. At that Conference my Government is seeking to ensure appropriate conditions that will enable the representatives of the participating States to review  in a constructive spirit  the results achieved in the implementation of the Final Act  and to take account of the experience hitherto gained and of the tasks that lie ahead.36.	The Hungarian People's Republic places particular importance on contributing  within its modest means  to the halting of the arms race and to the elaboration of additional disarmament measures. Our representatives are guided by this same desire at international forums  particularly here at the General Assembly and in the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  as well as at various bilateral and multilateral talks. We are convinced that political detente should be followed up by positive measures in the military field  without which detente can hardly be expected to last.37.	My Government is concerned by the attempts of some circles in the developed capitalist countries to whip up the arms race once more. The incessant rise in the arms expenditures of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the plans for the production of new types of weapons have an adverse effect on current negotiations pertaining to certain disarmament problems  and on the international climate in general.38.	We  for our part  attach particular importance to the Soviet-American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  as they have far-reaching implications for the future of the process of detente.39.	One cannot be satisfied with the present state of the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Those talks have been going on for over four years now  without making any substantive progress.40.	We are convinced that an agreement on both the limitation of strategic arms and the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe can be reached only if the parties involved adhere to the principle that none of them shall consider its security prejudiced by any disarmament measure  and only if the Western negotiating partners give up their attempts to obtain unilateral military advantages.41.	The general and complete prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests remains an immediate task of the highest importance for the control of nuclear armaments. An encouraging and positive response was received in the affirmation  in the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Mr. A. A. Gromyko   of the Soviet Union's readiness  in arrangement with the United States and the United Kingdom  to suspend underground nuclear-weapon tests for a certain period of time even before the other nuclear Powers accede to the future treaty.42.	We hope  and indeed expect  however  that such accessions will be forthcoming before long.43.	It would serve to reduce the risk of nuclear war if the participants in the Helsinki Conference accepted the proposal  put forward by the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty at its Bucharest meeting last year  that the States parties to the Final Act of Helsinki should assume  under an international treaty  an obligation to refrain from being the first to use nuclear weapons against each other. We deplore NATO's refusal of that proposal  for it indeed merits serious study.44.	We think that we are making a contribution to the final elaboration and conclusion of a comprehensive international agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons and on the destruction of their existing stockpiles as we are also willing to conclude  as a first step  an agreement banning only the most dangerous means of chemical warfare.45.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic considers it as a matter of extreme urgency that a treaty be concluded on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and that an international agreement be signed under which all States of the world would undertake not to use force in international relations. The relevant drafts of the Soviet Union provide an appropriate basis for starting concrete negotiations. There are countries that  clearly for motives contrary to these goals  wish to avoid concluding such treaties.46.	We look forward with expectation to the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We feel that  because of its impact on world public opinion  that forum will be able to bring a favourable influence to bear on the States that at present keep aloof from disarmament efforts for various reasons. The common cause would not be advanced if efforts seeking any rash modification of the working procedures at present employed in the search for solutions to certain disarmament problems were to gain currency at that session. We further expect the special session to agree on definite measures designed to promote the early convening and successful outcome of a World Disarmament Conference. From the point of view of peace and security we place particularly great emphasis on having the hotbeds of tension eliminated by political means and on blocking the way to the emergence of new critical situations.47.	One of the longest-standing hotbeds of tension is the Middle East  where the prolonged crisis is a heavy burden on international relations. More than 10 years after the Israeli aggression of 1967  the illegal occupation by Israel of Arab territories and the denial of the rights of the Palestinian Arab people persist to this day in defiance of numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. What is more  by establishing a growing number of settlements and by extending the application of Israeli laws to occupied territories  the Government of Israel gives evidence that it is striving for the final annexation of the Arab territories.48.	My Government still holds that the Geneva Peace Conference  if attended by all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  is an appropriate forum for a comprehensive settlement of the crisis. What is needed is to have agreements elaborated whereby Israel withdraws its troops from the Arab territories occupied in 1967; whereby the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including the right to establish their own State  are recognized and enforced; and whereby the security of all peoples and States in the region is guaranteed.49.	In order to achieve this agreement  it is necessary for the Arab and the socialist countries to carry out more effective co-operation and for the spokesmen for the dead-end ""step-by-step"" policy to learn at last to live with the hard facts.50.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is deeply concerned over the armed conflict in the Horn of Africa  which is detrimental to the peoples of that region and provides encouragement to the efforts of imperialism and to the reactionary forces collaborating with it. It serves to divert attention from the Middle East and from the burning situation in the southern part of Africa; it is dealing a telling blow at African unity  and it may create a dangerous precedent. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic condemns any armed attack on other countries and any manipulation of the liberation movements. We feel that the solution lies in a negotiated settlement of contentious issues.51. With the disappearance of the ""protective belt"" around the racist regimes in southern Africa  there has emerged a qualitatively new situation in that part of the continent. The formation of a majority government in Zimbabwe and the attainment of independence in Namibia are immediate and feasible tasks  while the question of the oppressive regime of the Republic of South Africa is also ripe for solution. Great possibilities are  nevertheless  fraught with great dangers  since imperialism wishes to force sham solutions upon the interested parties in order to save its own economic and strategic positions.52.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  which has from the outset been in favour of eliminating the colonial system  wishes the forces fighting against colonialism and imperialism to be more united than ever in pursuing their cause and to draw up ever more viable programmes for social progress. We are convinced of the ultimate success of their struggle. My Government is against apartheid  too  and it was in that spirit that our representatives took part in the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos.53.	The Hungarian People's Republic has not altered its stance on the question of Cyprus. We must seek a settlement that will guarantee the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  with due regard to the interests and equality of the two communities. We believe that the holding of an international conference  convened under United Nations auspices  would serve a useful purpose in helping us towards a settlement of the question of Cyprus.54.	The reduction of tensions and the strengthening of general security on the Asian continent would be greatly enhanced by a settlement to the situation in the Korean peninsula. My Government continues to lend staunch support to the just endeavours of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attain the peaceful reunification of that country.55.	The Hungarian Government attaches great importance to the wide implementation of human rights. As is shown by historical experience  it is the socialist system of society that is best equipped to ensure in practice that people live a life of human dignity and enjoy the fullest measure of human rights.56.	What we find is that some circles employ what is  to say the least  a special approach to human rights. They are absolutely silent on such fundamental human rights as  for instance  the right to work and the right to medical care; they keep quiet about racial discrimination and equal rights for  among others  women; and they are chary  of speaking about such paramount human rights as the right to peace  security and life. It goes without saying that their non- enforcement deprives political rights of any substance and makes their enjoyment illusory  and it reveals the political aims sought by the extensive campaigns launched about human rights issues.57.	The States Members of the United Nations will comply with their obligations concerning human rights if they make joint efforts to put an end to gross and mass violations of human rights  if they abolish the remnants of the colonial system and eliminate racial discrimination  if they assist in restoring human rights in Chile  South Korea  South Africa  and the Israeli-occupied Arab territories.58.	My Government repute the United Nations institutional system concerned with human rights as being sufficient and adequate to promote the effective respect for and observance of such rights throughout the world.59.	The efforts to develop the economic relations of States and to place international economic relations on a democratic and just basis have come to play an increasingly important role in international life. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic devotes special attention to this set of problems. We know that a truly broad-based range of external economic relations can be built only in conditions of lasting peace and stable security  and that the serious problems faced in the field of international economic relations can only be resolved in a prevailing climate of detente. On the other hand  however  we firmly believe that the advancement of detente and the strengthening of peace and security cannot be separated from the settlement of economic problems. It is our conviction that placing international economic relations on a new basis is a problem of universal scope and that the efforts to achieve this should include finding equitable solutions for the economic problems of developing countries.60.	My Government will continue to devote great attention to the economic problems of developing countries and will  within the limits of our possibilities  make further efforts to promote their economic development. In no way can we disregard  however  the historical and present-day responsibility that is incumbent on certain developed capitalist countries for the economic backwardness of developing countries. Attempts to blame both the developed capitalist and the socialist countries on this score without making any distinction between them are unjust and lack scientific foundation.61.	External economic relations play an immense role in my country's economic development. One of the main sources of our economic achievements lies in economic co-operation with the other socialist countries within and outside the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance; but the dynamic growth of our economic co-operation with the developed capitalist countries and with numerous countries of the developing world is likewise growing in importance. The growth of trade flows with the developed capitalist countries has been slowed down by discriminatory measures which are not being removed as quickly as could be desired. Certain groups in the West even some out openly against expanded economic co-operation between socialist and capitalist countries  trying to present the development of economic ties as if it served only the interests of socialist countries and demanding political concessions from them in exchange for increased economic co-operation. My Government resolutely rejects such attempts and reaffirms its position in favour of establishing equal and mutually advantageous economic relations free from discrimination. We hope that those efforts  contrary as they are to the spirit of detente and to present-day realities  will be isolated and that East-West economic co-operation will receive a fresh impetus.62.	While the results achieved by the United Nations in pursuing its purposes and principles as enshrined in the Charter are not negligible  the Hungarian delegation agrees with those who urge the world Organization to be more action-oriented in its contribution to the attainment of those goals  that is  primarily  to the safeguarding of peace  the strengthening of international security  the development of international relations and the advancement of peoples. The Charter offers a number of opportunities for increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations that have not yet been duly used. It is our common duty to use them to advantage in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Charter. The Hungarian People's Republic still favours the adoption of measures likely to strengthen the role of the United Nations without amending the Charter.63.	May I conclude by assuring you that the Hungarian delegation will do its utmost to ensure that this session of the General Assembly will make an effective contribution to resolving the important questions on our agenda. "
"58",3139,"IDN",32,1977,"﻿51.	It gives my delegation great pleasure to salute our present President  Mr. Lazar Mojsov  the representative of Yugoslavia  which is a founding member of the non-aligned movement and an ardent fighter for the principles of non-alignment and their implementation. It is with great satisfaction that my delegation is participating in the work of the General Assembly at the current session  fully convinced that under your experienced leadership  Mr. President  the Members of our Organization  and in particular those belonging to the non-aligned movement  will rise to the challenges and respond to the opportunities of our changing times.52.	My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  whose invaluable and dedicated leadership during the Assembly's last session does honour not only to himself and his country but also to the non-aligned movement as a whole. His important and manifold contributions to the work of our Organization are well known and will long be remembered.53.	It is a source of gratification for my delegation to be able at last to welcome the representatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in our midst. Indonesia has consistently supported the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and it participated in sponsoring draft resolutions to that end. Now that it has become a Member of our Organization  my delegation would like to reiterate its conviction that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will contribute positively to the work of the United Nations. We look forward to close and fruitful co-operation with that country within the United Nations system in all matters  particularly those which are of common concern and interest to both our countries and our region.54.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government and the people of the Republic of Djibouti on the successful completion of the decolonization process leading to their independence  and to welcome them to membership in our Organization. The completion of this process marks the fulfilment of one of the important objectives embodied in the Charter. My delegation looks forward to close and useful co-operation with the delegation  of Djibouti in the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations.55.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Governments of Panama and the United States  in particular General Torrijos and President Carter  on the signing of the Panama Canal treaties. The signing of the treaties indicates that international issues  however intractable they might appear  can be ultimately resolved through negotiations.56.	My delegation wishes to reaffirm Indonesia's continued commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Indonesia believes that the United Nations is the best available instrument through which mankind's aspirations for peace  justice  freedom and economic and social well-being can be fulfilled. It is the best vehicle through which the existing world order can be transformed into a more just and equitable one  not through confrontation and armed strength  but through mutual co-operation and understanding  through dialogue and the recognition of the existence of diversity among the Members of our Organization.57.	While acknowledging this diversity  Indonesia believes that  nevertheless  the Members of our Organization are bound together by the many common interests which they share and by the task of having to deal with a continually expanding number of global problems which can be solved only through the concerted action of all nations and which no single nation  however strong and powerful  can solve on its own. Let us therefore  whenever possible  solve problems through consensus and seek solutions which take into consideration the individual needs and interests of Member nations.58.	In reviewing the world situation as it has developed during the past year  the thirty-second session of the General Assembly is confronted by a number of complex and difficult issues such as the Middle East  Cyprus  southern Africa and the question of disarmament which has dominated the agenda since the convening of the first session. The present session is  moreover  faced with the problem of providing the necessary political impetus for the realization of the new international economic order.59.	Let me turn first to the situation in South-East Asia  where an era of protracted and destructive war has passed and a new era of peace has set in. While there is no disagreement with regard to the need for establishing mutually beneficial co-operation between all countries in the region  the fact remains that such co-operation involves countries with different economic and social systems. Indonesia  like the other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  firmly believes that these differences should not stand in the way of establishing friendly and mutually beneficial relationships among all the countries in South-East Asia. I wish to literate Indonesia's determination to work with all countries of the region towards the achievement of peace  progress and prosperity.60.	We are well aware that a great many obstacles have made it difficult to achieve any significant progress in the efforts towards implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Not the least among those obstacles are the complexities of major-Power involvement in the region  which  for instance  are reflected in the continued escalation of the military presence of those Powers in the Indian Ocean. Indonesia therefore finds some encouragement in the statements made by the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union which reflect a more positive attitude towards the principles and purposes of the Declaration. We hope that this attitude will result in a greater willingness on the part of the two Powers to co-operate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. This  in turn  would undoubtedly render the prospects for progress in the Committee's work more favourable.61.	Since the inception of the United Nations  the problem of disarmament has always featured prominently as one of the principal concerns of the Organization. The recognition by the world community of the vital importance of disarmament for world peace and the well-being of mankind is reflected in the relevant articles of the Charter and also in the very first resolution adopted by the United Nations  which addressed itself to problems dealing with nuclear disarmament.62.	The entire history of our Organization has been marked by constant endeavours to give effect to one of its main goals  namely  the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion of the world's human and economic resources for armaments purposes. Mention must also be made of bilateral and regional initiatives taken in the field of disarmament.63.	Notwithstanding the pursuit of numerous and manifold efforts to bring about disarmament measures  the results  to our disappointment  have been marginal. The absence of a strong political will appears to be the main obstacle towards reaching agreement.64.	Recent developments  however  have raised new hopes for real progress towards disarmament. The most prominent of these developments is the resolution adopted by this Assembly last year calling for a special session in 1978 devoted to disarmament. Instrumental to this resolution was the decision taken a few months earlier by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries meeting at Colombo. In this context  it may be recalled that in 1961 the non-aligned group had already called for a special session devoted to disarmament issues or a world disarmament conference. The success of our efforts in the field of disarmament will be conducive to our endeavours to establish a new international economic order. In this connection  we should like to underline the remark made by the Secretary-General in his report: Disarmament must therefore be a vital part not only of our efforts to establish a better system of international peace and security  but also of our attempts to restructure the economic and social order of the world.In spite of the various and persistent efforts currently pursued to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  we must regretfully observe that the situation in the region is seriously deteriorating.65.	The gravity of the situation is the direct result of Israel's continued policy of occupation and expansion and its repressive practices against the Palestinian people. While numerous peace efforts are being pursued at present  Israel defiantly intensifies its policy of colonization by extending Israeli laws to the Israeli-occupied Arab territories on the West Bank and by establishing new settlements.66.	A highly explosive situation once again prevails in the area and may ignite an armed conflict engulfing not only the countries in the region but also inviting the involvement of external Powers. My Government has in no uncertain terms expressed its strong condemnation in regard to those Israeli policies and actions. These policies and actions constitute a violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter  and of relevant United Nations resolutions; they must  therefore  be considered null and void.67.	My. delegation wishes to reiterate its considered opinion  that the Palestinian question remains at the core of the Middle East problem. No just and lasting peace can be established unless it is based on the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967. Indonesia has always maintained that the Palestine Liberation Organization must take part in all discussions regarding the future of Palestine. We hope that an acceptable formula will be found with regard to participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in any meeting that might be convened in the search for a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem.68.	Indonesia also supports the demand of Moslems all over the world that the holy city of Jerusalem be returned to Arab custody.69.	As regards the Cyprus question  my delegation feels that the process of intercommunal talks initiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General offers the best hope for a just and lasting settlement of this problem. It is  therefore  imperative that the momentum generated by these negotiations should not be lost. My delegation is of the view that a peaceful solution can only be achieved if it gives adequate recognition to the legitimate rights and aspirations of the two communities in an independence non-aligned  bicommunal federal Republic of Cyprus.70.	The deteriorating situation in southern Africa is a matter of profound concern for the international community. Numerous initiatives have been taken under United Nations auspices and on the regional or bilateral levels towards finding a peaceful solution of the problem caused by colonialist oppression and racial discrimination. The adamant refusal by the minority racist regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury to accept a peaceful settlement has forced the peoples of southern Africa to intensify their armed struggle as the only way left open to them to achieve their sacred rights of freedom  independence and human dignity.71.	Two historic meetings under United Nations auspices were held recently in Mozambique and Nigeria and focused world attention on the evils of colonialism and racialism which have plagued the peoples of southern Africa for so long. Indonesia took the opportunity  in Maputo and Lagos  to reaffirm its strong commitment to the cause of freedom and racial equality  a commitment founded upon its experience of three and a half centuries of suffering inflicted by the same evils. Let me here  on behalf of the Government and people of Indonesia  once again express Indonesia's firm determination to continue to extend political and material support to those oppressed by racism and colonialism until the last vestiges of those twin evils are eradicated from the face of the earth.72.	My delegation was shocked to learn of the death of the young African leader  Steven Biko  while under detention in a South African prison. His killing  on top of the killings perpetrated in Soweto  will strengthen even more the determination of the black population in South Africa to fight for its political and human rights.73.	Indonesia considers the armed struggle waged by the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia to obtain freedom and human dignity to be entirely just and legitimate  and therefore lends them its firm support. My Government  however  continues to hope that at some stage a negotiated settlement might possibly be arrived at. We sincerely believe that the most desirable solution is a peaceful one  and we would urge the minority regime in Salisbury and Pretoria  even at this late hour  to accept the inevitable course of history.74.	With regard to Namibia  my delegation reiterates its firm support for the decision taken by the Assembly last year -in particular  the call for action by the Security Council.75.	On the question of East Timor  my delegation has made its position clear on a number of previous occasions  most recently in the General Committee of this Assembly at its 1st meeting on 22 September 1977.76.	The problem of East Timor has ceased to exist as a problem of decolonization. Its people  in the exercise of their right of self-determination  have made their choice to be independent through integration with Indonesia  and this process was completed on 17 July 1976. As a result of these developments  East Timor and the East Timorese have become an integral part of the Indonesian nation. Together with their kinsmen in the other provinces of Indonesia  they have now embarked on the long and difficult road of development. In the meantime  a general amnesty has been offered to the FRETILIN remnants who voluntarily surrender to the provincial authorities no later than 31 December 1977. Quite a number of former FRETILIN followers have made use of this amnesty and have returned to their villages. They are now participating in the reconstruction and development of their province.77.	In the economic sphere  we continue to witness uncertainties  with regard to both the world economic situation and the transformation of international economic relations. While signs of economic recovery are noticeable  the upturn remains hesitant. This situation has led many Governments  particularly in the developed countries  to focus their attention more on short-term problems and measures  and t9 pay no heed to the interests of the world economy as a whole  with a consequent spread of protectionist tendencies. Such development is not conducive to the expansion of international trade and also hampers the common efforts towards the restructuring of international economic relations.78.	The impact of this kind of development on the economies of the developing countries has been felt more severely on account of their vulnerability to cyclical fluctuations. Their development efforts have been adversely affected by persistent unequal terms of trade  instability of export earnings and erosion of purchasing power.79.	The intensive negotiations undertaken both within and outside the United Nations system in order to bring into  Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente concrete realization the broad global understandings at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly have so far produced limited results. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation was intended to pave the way to the restructuring of the international economic system in favour of the less fortunate countries  and simultaneously to break new ground in the efforts to resolve the fundamental global economic problems. The results  however  fell far short of the envisaged objectives  because the Conference made little headway in the areas of critical importance to the developing countries.80.	The resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly which was convened to make an overall assessment of these results was unfortunately not able to arrive at a consensus due to a basic divergence of opinions. We believe  however  that the inability of the session to agree on an assessment should not distract us from the urgent task that lies ahead. What is of paramount importance at this stage is to move vigorously towards the realization of a more balanced and equitable world economy.81.	During the resumed thirty-first session  there was a clear determination to implement without delay matters on which there was agreement. We are encouraged to note that all sides recognize the need to renew and intensify their efforts to secure positive and concrete results  within a reasonable time-frame  on outstanding issues relating to the establishment of the new international economic order.82.	It is against this background that the General Assembly this year will once again focus its attention on the complex and multifaceted problems of international economic co-operation and development.83.	My delegation entertains the hope that our present deliberations could lead to an intensification of negotiations in the process of establishing the new international economic order. To this end the General Assembly should provide guidelines for the conduct of such negotiations in the various bodies of the United Nations system and find solutions to the outstanding problems.84.	We do not suggest that in the General Assembly we should try to agree or negotiate on measures in all their detailed specifications. What is expected from us at this session  in our view  is the enunciation of our basic commitments  principles and decisions that will give major political impetus to the ongoing negotiations in the various existing forums such as UNCTAD  the multilateral trade negotiations and UNIDO. A much higher degree of political determination and readiness will indeed have to be shown in order to advance more rapidly and resolutely towards the attainment of our common objectives and the ramifications and stakes involved in our present common endeavour.85.	It is hardly necessary for me to reiterate the basic premise  that the best solution for the recurrent adverse international economic situation is the structural transformation of the international economic system  based on the recognition of the interdependence of nations and problems. We are aware that has not been sufficiently appreciated that the solution of the problems confronting the developing countries could contribute significantly to the global recovery process. From this perspective the international measures so far taken to help the developing countries have not been commensurate with the magnitude of their problems.86.	As a consequence  we are of -the view that a global policy of adequate amplitude and scope in favour of the developing countries in the crucial areas of international trade  development finance and indebtedness is urgently required. Such a policy could provide a powerful stimulus to the hesitant upturn in the world economy.87.	The restructuring of the commodity market with a view to strengthening the export earnings of the developing countries must become a major objective of international economic policy. Successful international action to strengthen and stabilize commodity markets as envisaged by UNCTAD's Integrated Programme for Commodities will constitute a break-through in international economic policy and contribute significantly to the over-all restructuring process.88.	The agreement in principle that a common fund should be established as a new entity to serve as a key instrument in attaining the agreed objectives of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  should be translated into a fuller and more specific agreement on the character of the fund. My delegation sincerely hopes that both sides  particularly the developed countries  will make every effort towards the successful conclusion of the forthcoming negotiations on a common fund as well as on individual commodities.89.	Another element of importance to the developing countries in the global economic policy is an increased flow of official development assistance and improved access to capital markets of the developed countries. It is indispensable that the developed countries display their political will to increase such flows to developing countries on a predictable  continuous and assured basis in order to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product by the end of this decade.90.	An issue of concern in the current economic context is the problem of the growing external indebtedness of the developing countries. International action to cope with inadequate growth and the rising levels of indebtedness of developing countries can contribute positively and significantly to the improvement of the over-all economic situation. This would entail an interrelated attack on the problems of strengthening the export earnings of developing countries  of increasing the transfer of resources on concessional terms  and of finding effective means to deal with the growing debt problems of developing countries.91.	An essential ingredient for bringing about the structural transformation of international economic relations is the realization of collective self-reliance through the promotion of economic co-operation among the developing countries. Indonesia has long since been convinced that the promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries can contribute significantly to their individual and regional resilience. Within the framework of ASEAN  we have sought joint solutions to the problems of national development and regional co-operation. Based on the Declaration of ASEAN Concord adopted at the first ASEAN summit in Bali in February last year  which outlined the programmes of action for co-operation in various fields  the ASEAN Heads of Government in Kuala Lumpur in August of this year agreed to further expand and intensify the implementation of the programme with a view to attaining its goals and objectives. The Kuala Lumpur summit also constituted another milestone in the history of ASEAN  because it was the first time since its inception that ASEAN as an organization conducted a dialogue at the level of heads of government with a number of developed countries in the region. Based on the directives given by the Kuala Lumpur summit  the economic ministers of ASEAN have taken concrete steps towards intensifying and accelerating the pace of economic co-operation in various fields. Among other measures  they agreed to expand the produce coverage of the ASEAN preferential trading arrangements and to implement the ASEAN industrial projects as soon as possible.92.	Thus  10 years after the establishment of ASEAN  that Association  has grown into a viable and cohesive entity  which  I believe  will not only benefit the economic and social advancement of its member countries but also that of the international community.93.	I would not wish to conclude this statement without registering the appreciation of my delegation for the valuable efforts made by the Secretary-General on behalf of our Organization and for the great services which he has rendered to the international community. We are most gratified that his gifts remain available to us during his second term and that we will continue to have the benefit of his incisive analyses of the challenges confronting our Organization.94.	We share his belief  as expressed in his illuminating report on the work of the Organization  that among the basic problems confronting the United Nations is the need to strike a working balance between the demands of national interests  on the one hand  and those of the international order  on the other. In dealing with the challenges posed by an increasingly interdependent world  the members of the international community must find ways to harmonize these conflicting interests and to make greater use of our Organization for constructive purposes.95.	The United Nations must be made more effective to exercise its harmonizing role and to become the machinery through which the international community joins hands in co-operative efforts towards solving the global issues that confront us today. The strength and the effectiveness of our Organization are dependent primarily and ultimately upon the composite attitude of its Member States. In this regard  we are happy to discern the emergence of a new mood among the international community—a mood characterized by an increasing desire for co-operation and accommodation. Let us capture the opportunities afforded by this spirit of co-operation and accommodation to make our Organization more responsive and better equipped to deal with new problems and new opportunities.

"59",3186,"IND",32,1977,"﻿183.	India recently accomplished a historic non-violent revolution. In a magnificent assertion of the indomitable human spirit  our people reaffirmed in March last their firm faith in a free and open society. Calculated efforts by forces of darkness and tyranny to destroy democracy were decisively defeated. The March revolution was clearly of far-reaching significance for our 600 million people. We are happy that its significance has been equally appreciated by freedom-loving people all over the world.184.	Our people boldly upheld the basic principles  values and aspirations on which the United Nations was founded more than three decades ago  and regained their hard-won freedom and fundamental human rights. I have  therefore  great pleasure in bringing to the United Nations the greetings of our people and of reiterating  on their behalf  at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly  India's abiding faith in the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining global peace and security and for promoting orderly progress through co-operation among nations based on justice and equality.185.	Our new Janata Government has been in office for barely six months. Nevertheless  much has already been achieved during this time. Basic human rights have been restored. The pall of fear that hung menacingly over our people has been lifted. Constitutional measures are being devised to ensure that democracy and fundamental freedoms can never be smothered again. But we are not going to rest content with this only. As solemnly affirmed by our Parliament on 22 July 1977  our people are determined to bring about by peaceful and legitimate methods  a socio-economic revolution  illuminated by democratic standards  vivified by socialist ideals and firmly founded on moral and spiritual values .186.	I am a newcomer to the United Nations  but India is not  having been associated actively with the Organization from its very inception. For me  it is a great privilege to address this Assembly. Indeed  as one who has been a  parliamentarian in my own country for two decades and more  I feel a special sense of exhilaration in attending this assembly of nations for the first time.187.	What has added to my pleasure is to have in the Chair  Mr. President  the representative of a country which  together with India  was one of the founders of the non-aligned movement  and with which we have firm bonds of friendship. I extend to you  Mr. President  the cordial felicitations of my Government and myself on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-second General Assembly. Your election is as much a tribute to your personal eminence and wide diplomatic experience as to Yugoslavia and the role it has been playing in strengthening the forces of peace and stability. We assure you of our fullest co-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities.188.	I also take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the outgoing President  Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the representative of our close neighbour  Sri Lanka  for steering the thirty-first session with great tact and ability.189.	May I also join the other delegations in paying my sincere tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who brings to his heavy responsibilities wisdom  patience and a deep commitment to the United Nations and its role in the promotion of international understanding and global well-being.190.	I should  moreover  like to compliment Mr. Waldheim for his thought-provoking report to the Assembly in which he has candidly drawn attention to the challenging tasks that lie ahead. The United Nations  he has pointed out   presents unrivalled opportunities  and  is still to some extent  an Organization in search of its identity and its true role .191.	The Janata Government stands firmly for peace  non-alignment and friendship with all countries. These policies have always represented India's national consensus and tradition. Non-alignment is a projection of national sovereignty in international relations. Its essence is not neutrality but freedom  which is the natural consequence of the struggle for the liberation of our nation from colonial rule and the liberation of the human spirit from subjugation and oppression. We believe in the true independence of nation-States and their freedom to pursue policies in their best national interests  and to judge every issue on its merit.192.	The new Government took the earliest opportunity  on assuming office  to declare its resolve not only to continue non-alignment but in fact to restore to the policy its original positive thrust. It is a matter of some satisfaction that our stress on genuine non-alignment and our decision to pursue the policy with vigour and dynamism has been understood and appreciated in its proper perspective.193.	The vision of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakum is an old one. We in India have all along believed in the concept of the world as one family. After many trials and tribulations there are prospects of realizing the dream in the shape of the United Nations which has reached near universality in its membership representing 4 000 million people of diverse races  colours and creeds. However  the United Nations should not function merely as a conclave of governmental delegations. We must see how this assembly of nations can be transformed into a parliament of man  representing the collective conscience and will of humanity.194.	The United Nations Charter was a pledge not just by nations or for nations. It was a declaration on behalf of the peoples of the world to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and  what is more  to build a new world order in true freedom 195.	My thoughts are not in terms of the might and majesty of nations. Much more important to me are the dignity and demands of the common man. Our successes and failures should be judged ultimately by one yardstick alone: whether we are working towards social justice and dignity for all peoples  indeed for every man  woman and child. For its success the United Nations must become the effective voice of all humanity and a dynamic forum for collective action and co-operation based on interdependence between nations.196.	Our own history and political experience have taught us that the real sanction  indeed the ultimate power  rests in the will and response of the people  not in governments. Thirty years ago under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi our people courageously fought the might of a great imperial Power and ended its domination over India without resort to arms. Earlier this year our people successfully frustrated attempts by a self-seeking regime to deprive them of their fundamental freedoms.197.	What came to pass took many friends abroad by surprise. But to me the great political courage shown by the people came from our ethos and tradition. The individual in India has always been given the pivotal place in our religious and philosophic tradition. Our scriptures and epics have all along made one central point: the cosmos and creation hinge on the individual and his fulfilment.198.	We have accepted all along that divinity may have many forms. Everyone in India is therefore free to pursue his own path to salvation  irrespective of birth or belief. At the same time  however  our seers  in an unbroken line from ancient Vedic times to the present  have taught us compassion and tolerance towards our fellow man. Gandhi summed up the essence of this teaching in a favourite word: Antyodaya  which means  unto this last . This word  which he used time and again in his messages  signifies the concern which any society should have for the well-being of the poorest  the lowliest and the lost.199.	I am  therefore   convinced that our national as well as international politics must be constantly permeated with the thought of man  his happiness and well-being  and his essential unity with fellow beings. I am not thinking of man in the abstract  in whose name tyranny has been perpetrated down the ages. What I have in mind is man of flesh and blood. Our central concern must be his joys and sorrows  his hopes and aspirations.200.	We stand for peace—a warm  living peace—which is the bedrock of all our efforts. Peace  however  is not just the absence of war. The tenuous fabric of world peace could be torn asunder any time. Peace can be secured only by collective effort to end the exploitation and domination of one people over another and by eliminating glaring inequalities and imbalances between nations  and in the rights and opportunities for the world's peoples.201.	Each nation-State has  no doubt  to preserve and promote its national interests. But no country can live in isolation within the four corners of its frontiers. We have to recognize the inevitability of global interdependence for promoting human welfare and happiness in every part of the world. And interdependence  demands that we should all look beyond our national horizons and display a spirit of accommodation and sacrifice in order to share with the rest of mankind the fruits of progress and prosperity.202.	The world has come a long way since India launched its national liberation movement against colonialism and imperialism. As an Asian country  we watched with anguish the enormity of the suffering and sacrifice of the brave Vietnamese people in their long struggle for national liberation. Their ultimate success is a shining tribute to the might and power of the human spirit and its indomitable resistance to subjugation.203.	We are happy that the United Nations has rightly and properly mounted an international operation to provide assistance for the reconstruction of Viet Nam and for the rehabilitation of its people  as task in which my country is extending its full co-operation.204.	It is with a feeling of great joy that we welcome the entry of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam into the United Nations. We also extend a cordial welcome to a new African State  the Republic of Djibouti. The entry of these two countries into the United Nations has taken this Organization one step closer to its goal of universality. We have friendly ties with both countries and look forward to working with them in closest co-operation.205.	We mourn the passing of Archbishop Makarios  the President of Cyprus  and pay our homage to his memory. The late Archbishop was a world statesman and one of the founding fathers of the non-aligned movement. He was the chief architect of the independence of Cyprus and its struggle to preserve its identity.206.	The agenda before the Assembly is one covering a multitude of problems of current concern to the world. May I spotlight only a few specific issues which are of great importance and urgency and must take priority in our collective deliberations.207.	Foremost among these problems is the momentous and agonizing struggle for human rights and freedom in southern Africa. India has always been opposed to unnecessary bloodshed and violence in national affairs and interstate relations. It stands for non-violence and for resolving conflicts along the path of peace and negotiations. Even during the dark period of foreign subjugation  India adhered to certain basic principles:  steadfast opposition to colonial oppression and total rejection of any form of racialism and suppression of human rights. India's dedication to these principles is even deeper today.324208.	The challenge in Africa is clear: whether a people have the inalienable right to live in dignity and freedom or whether a racist minority can be allowed to perpetuate injustice and oppression over the vast majority. There is no question that all forms of racialism must be eradicated  root and branch. Apartheid must go. Its continuance is a blot on humanity and a grave reflection on the United Nations.209.	India would like to see the problem of Zimbabwe resolved at the earliest possible moment through peaceful means. It has thus welcomed the positive elements in the recent Anglo-United States initiative taken towards the establishment of genuine majority rule within a time-bound framework. We hope that the Security Council resolution adopted recently on the subject  resolution 415 (1977)  will lead to a ceasefire and eventually to a solution of the problem.210.	Much will depend upon the willingness of the illegal Ian Smith regime to see reason and give up its arrogance and intransigence. Until the Smith regime is ousted from power and freedom is restored to the long-suffering people  we cannot expect the freedom fighters to lay down their arms. In the meantime  India reaffirms its support for  and solidarity with  the patriotic forces of Zimbabwe  who are valiantly fighting for the liberation of their country against heavy odds. If world opinion continues to be wilfully defied by Ian Smith in a desperate bid to cling to power  the United Nations will have to exercise all its authority to widen its mandatory sanctions against the illegal minority regime and its South African supporter. That alone would hasten its collapse and help to restore to the people of Zimbabwe their inalienable right to determine their own destiny.211.	The authority  credibility and prestige of the United Nations face an equally stubborn challenge in Namibia  which has the status of an international Territory. If remains to be seen whether the efforts of the Western Powers can bring about the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia so that the resolutions of the United Nations may be implemented. We condemn South Africa for its decision to integrate Walvis Bay  a part of Namibia  with the Cape Province. We also condemn South Africa for its reported plans to use a part of Namibian territory for nuclear testing.212.	We stand by the South West Africa People's Organization and urge all nations to recognize its representative character. We cannot expect the people of Namibia not to resort to armed struggle if that is the only means left to them to achieve their goal of independence. However  the issue cannot be left to be resolved only by the efforts and struggle of that Organization. The United Nations has a collective and direct responsibility. It has by no means exhausted its capacity to discipline the South African regime into total withdrawal from Namibia.213.	While in southern Africa we face colonialism and racialism at its worst  in west Asia there remains an even more explosive threat to international peace. Here  too  some basic principles are involved  First  no one can be permitted to enjoy the fruits of aggression. Secondly  no people can be denied their inalienable right to their homeland. Thirdly  all border disputes should be resolved by negotiation and not by force.214.	There can thus be no recognition of the territories illegally occupied by Israel through the use of force and aggression  and they must be vacated. At the same time the Arab people of Palestine who have been forcibly evicted from their hearths and homes must be enabled to exercise their inalienable right to return to their land. All peoples and States in the region have the right to live in peace and harmony with their neighbours. That is an essential prerequisite for a durable solution to the problems of the region.215.	The United Nations must also reject and repudiate the recent efforts by Israel to alter further the demographic character of the territories occupied through new settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza. Unless resolved satisfactorily and in good time  the problem would have disastrous repercussions far beyond the region. There is clearly urgent need to reconvene the Geneva Conference  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in it.216.	The situation in Cyprus remains unresolved. We still hope that bicommunal talks may be resumed and a solution will be found which is consistent with the territorial integrity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus.217.	Economic issues are an increasingly vital dimension of international relations. The concept of a new international economic order based on equality and justice has already been accepted by the world community. We must now move forward to its early realization so that men and women everywhere may look forward to more just and equitable opportunities and rewards for their labours.218.	I mentioned earlier the challenge and paradox of how to balance national responsibilities with the imperatives of unavoidable international co-operation. After over 30 years with the United Nations we recognize  better than before  that no nation or group of nations can become islands of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. The discussions on international economic relations have been going on for more than two decades. Even the modest targets set for the current Second United Nations Development Decade have been either disregarded or diluted. The transfer of resources and technology has never been sufficient to correct the accentuated disparities.219.	All these problems were vividly explained and projected in the Conference on International Economic Cooperation  which ended in Paris this year. In the 18 months of long deliberations some progress WAS made  but results were deeply disappointing. A special fund is to be set up and some commitment to fulfil the allocation of overseas development aid has been reaffirmed. But the major problems of transfer of resources-and technology and relief from the burden of debt remain. The common fund within the Integrated Programme for Commodities has been agreed to in principle but remains to be realized in practice.220.	Arguments and theories are being put forward which do not show sufficient appreciation of the grave crisis confronting the developing countries. Perhaps that is due to the preoccupation of the developed nations with their own problems and difficulties. In many cases  what is being given by one hand is being taken away by the other.221.	It is claimed that modern science and technology have- the means of removing poverty and spreading the benefits of progress to the v/hole world. The fact  however  remains that the non-availability of the right type of technology for the developing countries is only accentuating the disparities between the rich and the poor. International commerce has undoubtedly multiplied in the post-war decades. But the advantage from its manifold increase has contributed mainly to the material progress and higher standards of living in the developed world.222.	The problems of the easing of trade barriers for the developing countries and protection of remunerative prices for their exports remain more or less where they were following the energy crisis. The problem of oil-importing developing countries is so serious that they can look forward to nothing but mounting debts for survival.223.	We recognize that developed nations have their own internal social and economic problems. But they need to lift their perspectives and policies beyond immediate and narrow national concerns. One could ask  Would it not be economically sound to facilitate a significant flow of financial and technological capabilities from the developed to the developing world as an enlightened answer to structural problem? for their own economies? An increase in the purchasing power of 3 000 million people inhabiting the developing countries could well provide an answer to the problems of unemployment and economic dislocation in the affluent world.224.	India has participated with vigour and sincerity in all the deliberations of the world community  not in a sprit of confrontation  but in the recognition that the world economic malaise requires a new sense of international interdependence.225.	In this regard I venture to suggest an approach which was suggested many decades ago by Mahatma Gandhi. He was indeed a universal man. Only two days ago we celebrated the one hundred and eighth anniversary of his birth. He had a clear perception of the world economic order based on certain principles which  in my opinion  may be summed up as follows.226.	First  all peoples have a right to the satisfaction of their primary needs  irrespective of the state of their economies  their levels of productivity  or their geographic location.227.	Secondly  interdependence between nations must be without exploitation. Since there can be no genuine interdependence among unequals  action must be taken to correct this inequality.228.	Thirdly  the developing countries must pursue paths of individual and collective self-reliance as part of their over-all strategy to secure the transfer or resources and technology from the developed world.229.	Fourthly  despite their division into nation-States  the people of the world constitute one family. An integrated world economic order demands movement across frontiers  not only of goods  capital resources and technology  as at present  but even more so of people themselves.230.	Fifthly  economic strategy should be directed towards the growth of employment rather than the growth of gross national product alone.231.	Sixthly  there should be a world-wide movement against the extravagance of consumption  which tends to dehumanize and alienate man from his fellow-beings.232.	Seventhly  the developing countries  no less than the developed world  must reduce the gap between their elite and their masses. An equitable world economic order can only be based on an equitable economic system within each nation.233.	As the second most populous country in the world  the dimensions of our problems are immense. Our achievements are noteworthy  but challenging tasks lie ahead. As a country which has recently recommitted itself to the democratic path and the principle of rule by consent our tasks tend to become more complex.234.	We have no magic wand or instant solutions to the myriad problems inherited from the near and the distant past. But we have reason to be optimistic and confident. In three decades of independence  the traditional genius of our people has enabled them to show their capacity to grasp the new opportunities offered by science and technology and to bend these modern tools of innovation and advancement to serve our own national needs.235.	While recognizing the advantages of international co-operation  we have sought to depend largely on our own effort for national progress and economic self-reliance. Our new Government is in the process of setting itself new priorities and removing the distortions that have crept into our policies and planning. On the  economic front  we want to move away from the  growthmanship  and blind imitation of industrialized States towards integrated planning in which man is at the centre.236.	We propose to concentrate more on the development of our rural areas  where an overwhelming proportion of our people live and will always belong. We do not seek affluence based on elitist consumption. Man must be judged by what he is  and not by what he has. We want to provide our jobless people with purposeful employment and fulfil the basic needs of the underprivileged masses. We seek to arrest  if not to reverse  the process of urbanization  which has become one of the biggest social and economic problems of the developing world—a subject on which Gandhi sounded a note of caution many decades ago.237.	Even as India struggles for a better tomorrow  it has demonstrated its willingness to share the benefits of its economic and technological experience with other developing countries. Our professional and academic institutions have been providing training and instruction to thousands of students from other developing countries in diverse fields of social and economic development. We stand for increasing co-operation with other developing countries to mutual advantage  without in any way seeking exclusive advantage  either economic or political.238.	India seeks friendship with all and dominance over none. The Janata Government has actively sought to build bridges of friendship  understanding and co-operation with all countries. Attention has been paid  first and foremost  to strengthening ties with our immediate neighbours. This is the message I sought to carry to Nepal  Burma and Afghanistan in my recent visits. We look forward to consolidating the process of normalization of relations with Pakistan  not only to ensure durable peace  but to promote beneficial bilateral co-operation.239.	Four days ago  on 30 September  the representatives of India and Bangladesh initialed the text of an agreement on the Gang waters issue. It is a comprehensive understanding covering the short-term problem  and lays the foundation for a long-term solution to meet the optimum requirements of both countries.240.	This problem has bedevilled the relations between us and our neighbour for 25 years. The agreement vindicates our faith that so complex a problem  affecting the economy and lives of millions of people of two neighbouring nations  could only be resolved in a spirit of shared sacrifice and mutual accommodation through sincerely motivated bilateral negotiations.241.	Many political changes have taken place in the last year in South Asia. Even so  it is a tribute to the people that this area is today freer of tension than it has been for decades. If  indeed  South Asia can find a recipe for peace and co-operation  all of us with similar burdens can then devote greater attention to development and to constructive endeavour. In fact  it is in this context that we make the special plea that the area around us-the region enveloping the Indian Ocean-should be made free of great-Power rivalry and bases which can be used for aggressive actions. In the wider context  India welcomes the continuing search for detente—detente not only in Europe but everywhere—so that the benefits flowing from it can be enjoyed by all.242.	Year after yea: scores of resolutions have been adopted at the United Nations calling for general and complete disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament. The arms race  with the resulting arsenals of fearsome weapons  has reached such an alarming stage that the world is poised on the horns of a strange dilemma. We are told that nuclear weapons are necessary as a deterrent against war and that it is only the assurance of their use that constitutes the core of deterrence.  we do not accept that thesis.243.	We believe that nuclear weapons are dangerous whether they are in the possession of one country  some countries or many countries. We are not only against the proliferation of nuclear weapons  we are against nuclear weapons themselves. India has been consistently opposed to the acquisition and development of nuclear weapons. Indeed  India was the first country to plead at the United Nations more than 20 years ago for a ban on the testing of all nuclear weapons. The great Powers were not in a mood to listen to us at that time. When they were ready for it  they signed the partial test-ban Treaty. That was 14 years ago. The world rejoiced and believed that a comprehensive test-ban treaty was close at hand  but we are still waiting. More nuclear-weapons tests have been conducted since the partial test ban than prior to it. Weapon tests underground are being conducted even now. There has been no progress in nuclear disarmament.244.	We are not a nuclear-weapon Power and have no intention of being one. The new Government has reiterated this position in unambiguous terms. Our Prime Minister  Mr. Moraiji Desai  has said that India would not go in for nuclear weapons even if all the other countries in the world did so. We did not sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons because it was a discriminatory and unequal Treaty. Nothing has happened since that Treaty was formulated nearly 10 years ago to change our view.245.	India embarked upon a programme for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy nearly 25 years ago. We continue to be committed to it. We fully share the view that non- proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be confused with non-dissemination of nuclear technology. We shall oppose  as before  any moves or measures that would stand in the way of the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. We shall also oppose moves or measures that are discriminatory in nature. At the same time we are prepared to co-operate whole-heartedly with other countries in discussing ways and means of putting an end to the danger of nuclear weapons.246.	It is both urgent and necessary for the political mind to free itself of military logic and for the political will to assert the force of reason and reverse the nuclear arms race in the direction of nuclear disarmament. We trust that the discussions in the special session on disarmament to be held next year will identify the priorities in nuclear disarmament and help the formulation of a time-bound programme of realistic and concrete measures for disarmament without further delay.247.	Already the establishment of the new international economic order is being delayed because of diversion of scarce resources to the futile arms race. World military expenditure is estimated to be more than $300 billion annually at current prices. Of this amount 90 per cent is accounted for by developed countries  which is equivalent to 20 times the official development assistance now given by them to developing countries. Even 5 per cent of the total expenditure incurred by the developed countries could vastly help the efforts of the developing countries to achieve many of their modest economic goals. Disarmament is thus vital not only to ensure peace and security but to promote speedy economic and social progress.248.	A great deal undoubtedly remains to be done. We often complain of the lack of will or progress. However  there is no occasion for cynicism and despair. Despite our many disappointments the family of the United Nations has an impressive record of achievement. I would commend the work of the ILO  WHO  UNESCO  FAO  UNCTAD and many other bodies within the United Nations system. Given the required funds these bodies could do a lot more to alleviate human suffering and promote well-being. A case in point is the WHO efforts to eradicate malaria  which is again raising its ugly head: Its programme to eradicate this scourge from the globe is estimated to cost about $450 million—half of what is spent daily for military purposes- yet the programme is dragging for lack of funds.249.	India is convinced of the necessity of supporting  strengthening and developing the United Nations as a universal Organization  not only for preserving peace among nation States and promoting respect for human rights  but also for fostering economic co-operation and harmonizing the actions of States. This is clearly a vital task facing the international community.250.	In the final analysis  I return to my basic theme. The greatest task before us  which envelops all the issues confronting mankind  concerns the welfare of man  regardless of race  colour  creed or nationality. All our problems  the questions of war and peace  economic malaise and rapidly diminishing natural resources  must lead us to one conclusion: in our interdependent world each one of us is his brother's keeper.251.	The single all-embracing item on our agenda is the future of man  and it will remain so in the years and decades to come. Man inherited  developed and still nurtures this good earth and is nourished by it. If we realize that his survival is inextricably linked with that of millions of others as never in the past  we shall reach the only answer to the requirement of our times: national sovereignty must adjust itself to international interdependence.252.	On behalf of India I pledge before this Assembly that our country will never be found wanting in its resolve to share in the sacrifice for the ideals of one world and for the welfare and greater glory of man."
"60",3232,"IRL",32,1977,"﻿1.	 I should like first  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is a source of particular satisfaction to me that you should take the chair in the year when Yugoslavia is host to the review conference of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  and in the year in which  after many years of fruitful contacts between our two countries  Ireland and Yugoslavia have entered into formal diplomatic relations with each other.2.	I also wish to extend a warm welcome to our two new Members  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. This represents a further significant step towards that universality of membership which we all wish to see and which can be one of the major strengths of this Organization.3.	I should also like  following his election last year  to voice my Government's confidence in the Secretary- General  Mr. Waldheim  whose deep concern for this Organization and for the preservation of peace is so clearly manifest in his latest report on the work of the Organization.4.	Since I have very recently taken office as Foreign Minister and since this is the first time I appear as representative of my country before this General Assembly  I think it is appropriate that I should reaffirm the commitment of the new Irish Government to the principles and the Charter of the United Nations.5.	Ireland has always strongly supported this Organization since we were admitted in 1955  and my Government will continue to do so. We know that the United Nations is not perfect; but it has a valuable-and indeed essential-role to play in world affairs. It is a meeting-place which is now almost universal in membership; and States from all corners of the world which belong to different regional groups find here that they have so much in common. They may come to understand—if not necessarily agree with-each other through formal and informal exchanges; and States in dispute with each other can explain their respective positions and seek the support of the world community in resolving these disputes.6.	Indeed the mere fact that the opening weeks of the session bring government leaders here from all around the world and oblige them to focus their attention seriously on major world problems can be so valuable in itself. Already at the current session there are some indications of modest progress on major issues such as the Middle East  southern Africa and Cyprus—though it would  of course  be unwise to be too optimistic.7.	We also see an important mediating role for the United Nations-through the actions of our Secretary-General  for example  or by the provision of peace-keeping forces in situations of conflict or potential conflict. Ireland has welcomed and supported such efforts in the past and we will continue to do so in every way open to us.8.	These are all good reasons to value our membership in the Organization and make it for each of us a pledge of our common commitment to peace  justice and the right of each member of the human family to a life of human dignity. But we must now  I feel  ask ourselves a further question: are we prepared to face  together  as truly united nations  a series of major problems which have forced themselves upon our attention with a new urgency as problems for the world community as a whole?9.	It seems to me that arms control and disarmament in particular are issues where we need a new sense of collective responsibility. This"" is vital because  as the Secretary-General points out  if we stumble once again into a world conflagration all our other hopes and activities will be in vain. While the Charter does not impose disarmament as an absolute obligation or specify exactly how it should be brought about  we know well that we do face a time-table.10.	It is a time-table imposed by the steady build-up of probabilities. If the world continues to arm and prepare itself for conflict  it becomes increasingly likely that it will stumble into conflict. If the balance in the world continues to depend on a regular and competitive addition of weight and force from each side  it becomes increasingly probable that it will not be maintained but will topple into disaster.11.	It follows then  as is said so often here  that a halt must simply be called to the growth of armaments  and real progress towards disarmament must be achieved. But can we move on from such a statement at the level of general principles? Can we make the specific choices and  if necessary  accept the particular risks which will lead to concrete negotiations and result in specific measures? This is a question which each of us must answer. But there are some for whom such specific actions are a special responsibility because they  more than others  have chosen to develop and accumulate increasingly massive and destructive weapons. They have thus  for their own reasons  become front-runners in the arms race.12.	This means  in particular  the nuclear Powers. A State does not become a nuclear Power by accident  but by choice. It is legitimate therefore for those who are not themselves engaged in this race to suggest that those who are have a very special responsibility to all of us. President Carter  in his statement to the General Assembly yesterday drew attention to this special responsibility and accepted it on behalf of the United States. But others  too  have their responsibilities to face  in particular those who have chosen to build up their forces for the purposes of general or regional deterrence or advantage  or who help others to do so  even if they have not themselves become nuclear Powers.13.	The need to curb the staggering waste of the arms race and to redeploy for the good of mankind the resources thus released explains the world-wide support for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament next year.14.	In some ways the forum which this General Assembly provides is not well suited to disarmament negotiations. But it can and must focus attention on the problem and bring the forces of world opinion to bear in establishing priorities.15.	We need to speak plainly and we need to elaborate a precise programme if the world public is not to regard the special session as another ritual meeting irrelevant to their real concerns.16.	We need a strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; we need a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests; we need to limit and reduce the immense expenditure on conventional arms  since more than 80 per cent of the world's military expenditure goes on such weapons.17.	A particular burden of responsibility in the matter of nuclear restraint rests on the two nuclear super-Powers. It is important  in my view  that the hopes expressed by President Carter here yesterday for progress towards a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty should be realized  and that progress should be made on a workable international programme which will ensure that peaceful nuclear technology is available  under proper safeguards  to the non- nuclear Powers.18.	But what we do on these questions  at the special session or otherwise  will be a success only if we work towards genuine disarmament and not simply towards controlled armament  which would not be an acceptable substitute for a real reduction in weapons systems. The Secretary-General has made this point very clear in his report.19.	The Secretary-General has reminded us  too  that we have not yet produced the results which were hoped for when the United Nations Charter was written some 32 years ago. We have not yet established a system  as was then said  ""to ensure the least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources"". On the contrary the waste of resources in the widening and increasing build-up of armaments has become a scandal which is crying out for change.20.	Today 25 per cent of the world's scientific manpower is engaged in military-related pursuits  and 40 per cent of all research and development spending is earmarked for military purposes. For the past several years  military expenditure has been about $300 billion each year. This sum is spent in a poverty-stricken world which urgently needs a new  more equitable  international economic order. It is a chilling fact that the resources devoted to the arms race since the end of the Second World War are roughly the equivalent of the total 1976 gross national product for the entire world. Think for a moment what a difference it would mean to the developing world if even a proportion of these funds could be used to help the countless millions living in poverty  those still without clean water  the sick  the uneducated  the deprived.21.	How much longer can the community of nations accept this scandal  that we direct so large a part of our resources to weapons with which to destroy one another? Surely a basic concern for humanity should make us cry out against this in a world where there is large-scale poverty and premature death from starvation of millions each year.22.	An end to wasteful expenditure on armaments alone is not sufficient  however  since much of the world's poverty and misery is due to under-development and to inequity in the distribution and use of the world's resources. We now have new reasons for concern about this. Mutual interdependence is no longer simply a phrase to be used in a speech. It is now an evident reality in the market-place and in the world economy as a whole. Whatever the historic origin of the present gross imbalance between those who are developed and those who are not  each now needs the other  and neither can go it alone. If the rule for our world today is to be  as it was often in the past  ""what I have I hold""  then the rule for tomorrow may well be ""what we now ignore will return to haunt us"".23.	We have surely had some salutary lessons in this regard in recent years. Few of us can have good memories of the crisis in energy supplies over these past years. But it has at least brought home some valuable lessons to those who suffered directly as well as to those who appeared to gain.24.	It seems to me that the drawing of these lessons and the setting of priorities to deal with the problems which arise should be a particular function of the General Assembly  because it can take a broader and more political view of what is necessary than other specialized agencies. But detailed negotiations to bring about the necessary change may have to be held elsewhere.25.	Economic development  of course  is not simply a matter of the transfer of resources  though that will certainly be required. It must also involve consideration of structural change which will permit development  once under way  to continue  and which will ensure that the benefits of that development will reach all of the populations who are entitled to benefit from it.26.	In seeking development and a fairer distribution of resources  we must also take account of the need to conserve and manage prudently the resources and environment of our planet. I would hope in particular that something can be done soon to give a new impetus to efforts to find and utilize new and cleaner sources of energy.27.	My Government notes  therefore  with particular interest  the Secretary-General's recent proposal that the energy problem must be recognized as having a global dimension which calls for international action within the United Nations system. His proposal that the United Nations could contribute to the establishment of a world ""energy order"" is important and will  I feel sure  be carefully studied during the current session.28.	My own country is itself part of the developed world. We are not  indeed  the most prosperous part of it. We have now come to see that  despite our own economic problems and our wish to improve our living standards  we must count as ""wealthy"" and not as deprived; and we accept the responsibility which goes with this.29.	In material terms Ireland's capacity to help poorer countries is limited by comparison with that of the more affluent donor nations. We are a small  open economy at an intermediate stage of industrial development  and we are consequently very vulnerable at a time of world recession. Our development co-operation policies must therefore be realistically tailored to our size and resources. But while the percentage of gross national product which we devote to official development assistance is still low  we have been able to increase it substantially in recent years  and it will be one of my principal objectives as Foreign Minister to increase it still further.30.	Over the past few years  too  we have considerably broadened the base of our development co-operation. Through our membership in the European Economic Community we participate in a wide range of development activity  principally in the implementation of the Lome Convention1 with the countries of Africa  the Caribbean  the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.31.	Through our participation in the Lome Convention we have had an opportunity to understand better the problems which face many countries in the third world and we have a particular sympathy for them because of our own historical background. This has strengthened our determination to take positive and consistent steps to work with them  through the institutions of the European Community  to help resolve these problems.32.	In addition to our participation in these multilateral activities we have recently begun our own bilateral aid programme. In doing so we have decided to concentrate on areas where we would appear to have a special competence. We believe that the experience of our own relatively recent economic development  achieved largely by- self-reliance and based primarily on rural development  should be of particular interest to many developing countries.33.	Many of the state agencies in Ireland which contributed so much to our recent economic development now find that they can be of particular assistance in helping developing countries. Indeed  there is a great deal of good will in our country towards the third world and its problems—based in large measure on our own historic experience  both political and economic. This finds expression in the personal commitment of a very large number of Irish men and women to voluntary service in developing countries. These men and women have built up a tradition of selfless personal service and I would like to reaffirm that it is my Government's policy to give their efforts every possible support.34.	A third major area where we need a new sense of collective responsibility is that of human rights.35.	Some may argue that this can be of concern to this Organization only in a limited way  since anything more would be unacceptable interference in internal affairs. That is perhaps appropriate to a world and to an Organization which is concerned simply to regulate and moderate the relations between States. But can this any longer be enough?36.	Of course there will be different interpretations of human rights. We here do  after all  differ greatly in our political outlook  cultural background and our fundamental beliefs. But we have a measure of common ground and we must build on it together. Already we have established good foundations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other conventions and covenants which have come into force over the past 30 years. There is a growing acceptance of common norms in relation to civil  political  social and economic rights  and it is now important further to secure these rights by working out acceptable investigation procedures.37.	A proposal to nominate a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights may come before the Assembly again this year. This proposal has as its aim to encourage full respect for and observance of the human rights obligations which we have all voluntarily accepted. My delegation will continue to support this proposal.38.	I would also like to commend the initiative taken last year in the General Assembly by the Belgian Foreign Minister who put forward the idea that States should voluntarily commit themselves now to accept  under appropriate United Nations procedures  that a United Nations committee of enquiry would be"" admitted to investigate any alleged breaches of human rights on their territories. My delegation will again give its fullest support this year to this Belgian proposal.39.	States in Western Europe have accepted  under the European human rights Convention  certain additional commitments and obligations which allow the investigation by an international tribunal established for that purpose of alleged breaches of human rights. We recognize that approaches to this question may differ from one region to another. But I would like to endorse here the hope expressed by previous Irish Governments that it may soon prove possible in other regions of the world—and ultimately at the level of the United Nations-to adopt similar procedures to ensure that the obligations we have all accepted in the matter of human rights will be observed.40.	In a world of nation-States it is particularly necessary  of course  to recognize the right of each people to independence and self-determination. This is one area of particular success in our Organization since  under its auspices  the larger part of humanity has  over the last 20 years  come to freedom and independence. We are happy that so much has been achieved-and this largely by peaceful means. Only in parts of southern Africa is this process resisted today.41.	In Rhodesia there can be no doubt as to the outcome. All that remains to be determined is the manner in which majority rule will be achieved. We must hope that  even at this late stage  the military regime can be brought to realize that it must come to terms with reality and negotiate a peaceful settlement with a view to an independent Zimbabwe. The present British proposals  supported by the United States  may well be the last chance. As the United Nations has been deeply involved since 1965 in the efforts to bring about majority rule in Rhodesia  I particularly welcome the involvement of the United Nations in the present proposals and wish the United Nations representative  on his appointment  every success. It is of crucial importance at this juncture that all possible pressure be maintained on the regime and that sanctions be rigorously enforced.42.	There are at last signs that the South African Government is responding to the view unanimously expressed by the international community that Namibia should be permitted self-determination and the right to independence while maintaining its territorial integrity. We have welcomed the efforts of the five Member States which have undertaken .the task of persuading South Africa to agree to a solution in accordance with Security Council resolution 385 (1976). Given the special responsibility of the United Nations in this area  this Organization will naturally wish to be closely involved in the implementation of any settlement and in ensuring that the wishes of the Namibian people are accurately determined and faithfully carried out.43.	In South Africa itself there is the major problem of an institutionalized form of racial discrimination known to the world as apartheid. There are  of course  many kinds of discrimination and much injustice in the world. But  in our approach to racial discrimination  we cannot forget the degradation  suffering and bloodshed which led to the creation of this Organization and which resulted  in part  from racialist doctrines originating  I am sad to say  in Europe.44.	Racial discrimination in itself is deplorable and wrong; when it is institutionalized and given form in political structures it is both wrong and dangerous; and when those political structures are used to suppress permanently a majority of people in their own country  it is disastrous. This is what is happening today in South Africa. How can those who impose the apartheid system in the name of ""separate development"" not see that it is a recipe for disaster?45.	-	Year after year this Assembly has expressed itself virtually unanimously on this issue  but there has been no perceptible result. For many years the leaders of the majority black African population have tried to lead their people to seek by peaceful means their basic rights and an end to their degradation. But nothing changes-except in minor detail—and each new generation must grow up to accept a system which limits and stunts its life and its possibilities. Is it any wonder that younger black South Africans and the movements through which they express themselves have turned more militant and that other African countries feel bitter? Indeed a major part of the world community would itself be classed under South African law as non-white and racially inferior—and so they  too  feel personally the injustices of the apartheid system.46.	My Government welcomed the decision of the United Nations to hold in Lagos the recent World Conference for Action against Apartheid and the opportunity given to Governments  including my own  and other interested organizations to outline their views in detail. We associated ourselves gladly with the Declaration adopted by consensus.47.	My Government condemns apartheid as an affront to the principle on which our own democratic State is based—the fundamental equality of all human beings. Apartheid  in contrast  is designed to maintain power permanently in the hands of a minority and to relegate to permanent poverty and under-development the majority of the citizens of South Africa. The application of the system necessitates oppression. The inhuman consequences of the ""bantustan"" and related policies have been made too tragically evident in the past year. We deeply regret the death in custody  under circumstances yet to be fully explained  of Mr. Steven Biko  a particularly gifted representative of his people.48.	The international community has recognized its obligation to those who are victims of oppression in South Africa  and we have contributed regularly to United Nations funds for that purpose. But  given the nature of the situation  merely to condemn those policies and aid their victims is not enough; persuasion must now be accompanied by action to bring pressure on South Africa for change. The majority in South Africa must be satisfied that the international community will help in their struggle for their just demands if they are to be persuaded that there is an alternative to violence; and those in power must be convinced of the disastrous consequences which will ensue if they do not change their ways. In this regard we find the arguments for concerted and binding action by the international community compelling. We therefore favour the imposition by the Security Council of a mandatory arms embargo  no less for the impact which such a decision could have than for its practical effect. Furthermore  my Government will continue to examine  with our partners  ways in which the collective weight of the European Community can be brought to be?'- on the Government of South Africa so as to cause it to change its policies  as announced in our common statement of 23 August 1977 to the Lagos Conference.49.	There are of course many other areas where there are particular regional problems and conflicts. In many such cases we can use the possibilities of this Organization to encourage the parties to negotiate and help to set up a framework for a settlement. But detailed negotiation and  ultimately  solutions most often depend on the parties directly concerned. Beyond their individual interests they must accept their share of the collective responsibility and be ready through negotiation to work to reconcile differences and end long-standing conflicts.50.	It is in that spirit that my own Government approaches the tragic situation in Northern Ireland. I would like here to speak of our hopes and aspirations within the broad framework which we have set for ourselves.51.	For more than eight years now violence has taken a heavy toll of life and property in Northern Ireland. Out of a small population of 1.5 million  almost 2 000 people have lost their lives and over 20 000 have been maimed or injured. The direct costs of this violence have run into hundreds of millions of pounds and the quality of life there has been seriously impaired. It will be understood that that tragic conflict with all its human and political implications is the source of deepest concern to everyone in Ireland; and my Government attaches a particularly high priority to working for a solution to it.52.	At the root of the complex problem of Northern Ireland is a difference between the aspirations of two main traditions in the island of Ireland. The island was divided 50 years ago in an effort—which proved unsuccessful—to solve the problem. Today the majority tradition in Ireland as a whole  including the minority section in the north of Ireland  maintains a hope of seeing Ireland united and independent  and they wish to bring this about peacefully and by consent. The aspiration of the other tradition- upheld by what is now the majority section of the Northern Ireland community-is different. It wants to see that part of Ireland remain a part of the United Kingdom.53.	The division of the island 50 years ago did not solve those differences. Instead it concentrated them within Northern Ireland; and the result was a new obstacle to a genuine political dialogue between the two Irish traditions and a distortion of normal political life in that area.54.	We do not underestimate the difficulties confronting all of us who are involved in the efforts to reconcile these apparently irreconcilable traditions. Much time and effort have been devoted in recent years to seeking political structures which will both take account of the present wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland to retain their link with the United Kingdom and yet enable the minority there to give expression to its political aims and to work peacefully for its aspirations to Irish unity. But further urgent efforts are required  and my Government shares the anxiety of those politicians who have expressed concern at the situation of constitutional stalemate which has existed in Northern Ireland since 1974. It has not  of course  been easy to pursue political goals in an atmosphere of violence and fear  and the burden imposed-on the political representations in Northern Ireland has been enormous. The stalemate which has led to the present political vacuum imposes particular obligations on the two sovereign Governments involved  namely those of Britain and Ireland  to renew and intensify their efforts to create a climate conducive to political progress. The role of the two Governments immediately concerned  working with the Northern Ireland elected representatives  is of first importance. External influences  whether on the part of other Governments or of international organizations can be constructive only if  first  they are supportive of the efforts of Britain and Ireland and  secondly  are based on the fullest possible understanding of the nature of the problem.55.	Here I should like to pay a tribute to President Carter's recent offer of encouragement for investment in Northern Ireland in the event of a settlement being worked out involving both sections of the community and supported by the Irish and British Governments. In his timely and generous offer of assistance the President has highlighted the economic aspect of the problem which  if improved  would contribute a great deal to creating the conditions for political stability. I have already referred to the fear and violence in Northern Ireland. There is also the depression and despair caused by economic deprivation which  because of a policy of discrimination over 50 years  is felt in a particularly acute way in the minority section of the Northern Ireland community. There are minority areas  especially in Belfast  where the unemployment rate is estimated at almost 40 per cent and there are families living there who are now entering into a third generation of unemployment. You will appreciate the difficulties in this atmosphere of creating a spirit of hope and confidence which is so vital to political progress. Policies must be created and implemented which will enable people not only to live without fear and violence but also to give them the dignity and self-respect to make their personal contribution to building for their future. A start has been made in recent years and all of us must  in our own way  help to create trust instead of distrust  dignity instead of despair  and confidence instead of uncertainty.56.	It was with this constructive approach that the Prime Minister of Ireland  Mr. Lynch  and I had discussions in London last week with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  Mr. Callaghan  and his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  Mr. Mason. I am glad to be able to report to you our view that the full understanding of each other's position which derives from that meeting has identified a certain harmony of approach and we expect that this measure of harmony will provide a fruitful basis for progress through co-operation. We look forward with hope and confidence to further such meetings which will build on this solid basis. The pace of progress will inevitably not be as rapid as many of us would wish. The problem we are dealing with has its origins  even more than most of the problems facing this Organization  deep in the past-a past of which we are proud and which places on us obligations which we must not ignore. But there are  as you will appreciate  no instant solutions.57.	To the consciousness of the past we must add the realities of the present and it is following the fullest consideration of both elements that my Government believes that it is in the interests of the people of Ireland  and of Anglo-Irish relations in general  to work now towards the eventual coming together of all the people of Ireland by consent  by persuasion  by peaceful means and under agreed negotiated structures. This has been  and remains  the long-term aim of our policy; and in the recent discussions which our Prime Minister and I had with Mr. Callaghan and Mr. Mason in London we repeated this view.58.	It is important  in advocating this approach to the Northern Ireland problem  to emphasize that the unity we speak of is a free and voluntary coming together"" of the people through new political structures on the island of Ireland.59.	There are important considerations which follow from this fact. First  in common with all Irish Governments since the foundation of the State and with all the political parties represented in our Parliament  my Government totally rejects the use of force in relation to the Northern Ireland problem. The Government which I have the honour to represent was elected this year with a very large majority. The Irish Republican Army [IRA]  a self- appointed group which refuses to recognize our democratic institutions  has no right to thwart the mandate which we have been given to implement our economic and political programmes. We reject and condemn the violence of the IRA and of the loyalist paramilitary groups  and my Government  for its part  has pledged its full support to deal firmly and decisively with violence from whatever source it emanates. To eliminate violence  in all its forms  from the political Process in Northern Ireland will continue to have for us the highest priority. In this way  we have been and will continue to make our very practical contribution to that most basic of human rights  the right to live.60.	Secondly  and precisely because our objective is one of eventual unity by agreement among people whose present aspirations differ  there must be a full and generous respect now for each of those aspirations. This is the essential pre-condition for the process of growing reconciliation which we wish to promote. We consider that any approach which attempts to suppress or ignore either of the different traditions is doomed to failure  and we are happy to welcome the assurance given in our recent talks with representatives of the British Government that its policy still is to work towards a devolved system of government for Northern Ireland in which both sections of the community would  by a sharing of power  participate on a fair basis. I acknowledge also the very consider able role being played by the various voluntary organizations north and south of the border in the process of reconciliation and pay a tribute to the courage and dedication of all those who are actively working in them.61.	In the light of the particular economic problems in Northern Ireland to which I have already referred-and these problems are acute in some border areas—the Irish and British Governments I am very happy to say have  at last week's meeting  also agreed to review the arrangements and opportunities for economic co-operation with particular reference to Northern Ireland. We are together about to embark on a review of current and proposed cross-border studies and will seek to identify subjects and areas for further examination  with assistance from the European Economic Community where appropriate. The Irish Government  in its approach to the general problem of Northern Ireland  takes courage from the fact that economic co-operation has played an important role in rebuilding a spirit of political co-operation in Western Europe since 194i. We are encouraged that historic differences there have been overcome. This achievement points the way for us in Ireland and in Britain.62.	I have already referred to the reassurance which derived from the recent meeting in London  and the Assembly will recall our support for the policy of working in the immediate future towards a devolved power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. This means  first  that there is an obligation on my Government and on those who belong to the Irish nationalist tradition to take account fully of the views of the majority in Northern Ireland  whose viewpoint is not directly represented in this Assembly. We look to the day when those who inherit that tradition will play a vital and important role in the future of the island of Ireland. Meanwhile  we believe that the power-sharing political institutions to be established in Northern Ireland must give appropriate expression to their views.63.	Equally  however  we maintain that it is important to respect the other tradition and aspiration-that of the minority. The institutions which we hope to see established in that area must not be such as to suppress those aspirations. They must not impair the effective exercise of political rights of those who wish to promote by peaceful means their legitimate aspiration of transcending the present division of Ireland-to create new structures in the island as a whole.64.	Unless political structures can be found which accommodate both communities adequately in the way which I have just outlined  there is a very grave danger that  whatever the short-term improvements in the security situation  the initiative will ultimately go by default back to the men of violence. It is therefore the urgent hope of my Government that all those involved will use every endeavour to establish and work towards agreed structures  which alone will enable Northern Ireland to escape further cycles of the violence which have ravaged it for so long. This task will require persistence and imagination. The British and Irish Governments and the political leaders of the two communities in Northern Ireland are all in various ways constrained by history. The harmony which we are now seeking cannot be based on a rewriting of that history and we cannot ignore the injustices of the past. However  we pledge ourselves to face the present realities in a generous spirit and we invite the other parties to move forward with us with the same generosity. We need now a co-ordinated effort to rise above the past—an effort which will show on a smaller scale in relation to the problems of our own small island that sense of basic collective responsibility and common interest of which I spoke earlier. I can pledge that my Government will for its part make every effort to contribute to this process of co-operation in the search for a peaceful solution to the problem of Northern Ireland. Our aim is to work through peace for peace.65.	I should like now to refer briefly to two of the other areas of conflict of particular concern to us.66.	In Cyprus also  the future is bleak  unless those involved are prepared to seek reconciliation through negotiation. As the representative of a country which has itself experienced the unhappy effects of partition  I would appeal to the two communities to renew the search for a settlement through the intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The aim must be a freely negotiated  just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem which will guarantee the territorial integrity and independence of the Republic and the viability and security of both communities. I sometimes fee)  as the Secretary- General has suggested recently  that we too easily take for granted the existence of the invaluable organs of the United Nations and their availability for peaceful negotiation and reconciliation. I hope that this will not be so in the case of the two communities in Cyprus but  rather  that they will take advantage of the framework available to them to resume substantive talks shortly and build on the guidelines agreed upon in February last.67.	The Middle East is an area where failure to achieve progress by negotiation and peaceful reconciliation could clearly have the most serious consequences for all of us. My Government has followed recent developments with close attention and concern; our basic views  which we hold in common with our partners in the European Community  were outlined in the statement issued by the nine Heads of Government at their meeting in London on 29 June last. What I should like in particular to emphasize here is the need for restraint by all those with power and responsibility in such a volatile situation. It is my earnest hope that recent welcome developments will create the framework for a comprehensive settlement and lasting peace.68.	In this statement  my first in the Assembly as Irish Foreign Minister  I have spoken of only some of the major issues which we face in this Organization and I have tried to give my views on how we should approach them. It is clear that in the face of these major problems we need new and deeper sense of our collective responsibility for the management of a world in which we all depend so heavily one on the other.69.	Many of the countries here belong to particular regional groups. They have committed themselves to such groups in the first instance for reasons of geography or for political or economic interest. The particular value of the United Nations is  however  that it brings together representatives of States from every part of the world. It identifies a common interest which is not contrary to  but will often transcend  the interest of any particular regional group. It seems to me important that wherever possible States belonging to a group or region should use the meeting-place; which this Assembly affords them for contacts and exchanges with States in other regions with which they may feel special sympathies because of similar historic experiences or otherwise. This action by individual members of regional groups can help to draw those groups together and establish between them a sense of common interest.70.	My own country belongs to the European Economic Community. We are one of its nine members. Our interest and our concern to contribute to building a new structure of co-operation and  ultimately  integration in Western Europe impelled us to join four years ago  and our people voted overwhelmingly in favour of this decision. But they never saw our membership as limiting or constricting. Rather  they believed that membership in the European Community would open up new perspectives for us on a wider world. We are committed to a close co-operation with our partners in the Community and we seek to establish common positions with them in the external field wherever possible. We shall be giving expression to this commitment as far as we can in our approach to various problems on our agenda  and we shall of course give our full support to the statement made earlier in this debate on behalf of the nine members of the Community by the Foreign Minister of Belgium  Mr. Simonet 71.	But none of us  however cohesive the group to which we belong  can ignore the larger world and our collective responsibility for it. We in Ireland see our membership in the Community as helping to open that world to us and we want to discharge our share of that responsibility through the Community to which we have committed ourselves.72.	It is our belief that my country's particular history and our particular economic experience give us the possibility of establishing links with countries of a similar background  even though they are geographically distant from us  and we would hope that this in turn will help to establish better relationships between the European Community and the regions and regional groups to which they belong.73.	At the outset I pledged my Government's commitment to  and support for  this Organization  its aims and objectives. I did so because I believe that many of the problems which face us today are closely interconnected and world-wide in character and that a solution to them can only be achieved through the United Nations. It is-certainly here that they can best be identified so that public opinion may be mobilized.74.	I believe this Organization can serve us all well  but only if we now use its possibilities to the full. This means seeking dialogue rather than confrontation; making a proper choice of the instruments and procedures available to us for international negotiation; and above all  showing a new sense of collective responsibility for the future of humanity as a whole.

"61",3279,"IRN",32,1977,"﻿217.	 May I begin by congratulating Mr. Lazar Mojsov on this election as the president of this thirty-second session of the General Assembly. It is a source of deep satisfaction to us that he  with his wide-ranging knowledge of international affairs and his political experience so well known in the United Nations  will be presiding over our deliberations.218.	I wish also to express our gratitude to Ambassador Hamilton Amerasinghe for the skilful manner in which he presided over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.219.	I should be remiss if I did not assure the Secretary-General of our support for his efforts to relax world tension and consolidate peace and security.220.	I take this opportunity to give a warm welcome to two countries joining our ranks in the United Nations and bringing this Organization closer to its goal of universal membership  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.221.	We meet at a time when the international community is confronted with many problems of paramount importance. I would like to deal with some of them briefly 222.	The existing situation in the Middle East constitutes one of the main obstacles to peace and security. In that area  grave tensions continue  with the ever-present danger of a new outbreak of hostilities. We believe that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  together with the relevant decisions  including those dealing with the status of Jerusalem  form a valid basis for reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. That Conference must be reconvened with the participation of all parties concerned. We further believe that any solution of the Middle East problem should take fully into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.223.	As long as Israel continues the occupation of Arab territories there can be no hope of establishing a lasting peace in that region. Recent moves by Israel in imposing its laws on the inhabitants of the West Bank and authorizing new Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab lands have created new obstacles on the road to peace  We hope  however  that genuine efforts will be made to put an end to this uneasy and precarious situation.224.	Another continuing problem is the situation in Cyprus. In spite of efforts by the Secretary-General and other attempts to find a solution  there has been no significant relaxation of tension. We continue to believe that negotiations between the two ethnic communities can and must bring about a just and lasting solution to this problem.225.	Concerning the Indian Ocean  the United Nations  through its Ad Hoc Committee  is actively engaged in efforts to ensure that this area will remain a zone of peace. My country has advocated co-operation among the countries of the region to achieve that objective and to keep the Indian Ocean free from great Power rivalry and competitive arms build-up.226.	As for the Persian Gulf  it remains our firm position that the task of maintaining security there is the exclusive responsibility of the States bordering the Persian Gulf. Peace and security should be safeguarded by promoting co-operation among these States  free from any outside interference. We are happy to note that during the past year there has been evidence of keener interest in closer co-operation for the benefit of all countries in that area.227.	As regards disarmament  we note with regret that no progress has been made this past year  even though we are now more than halfway through the Disarmament Decade. The General Assembly decision to hold a special session next year devoted to disarmament problems provides us all with an opportunity for new approaches to this matter. Having this in mind  Iran stands ready to co-operate with all members with a view to making the special session on disarmament a success. I would like here to emphasize that the goal of general and complete disarmament cannot be reached unless the major Powers themselves  whose arsenals   are swollen with nuclear and other sophisticated weapons  make more active endeavours towards the realization of this goal. This becomes even more necessary as new weapons of mass destruction are developed.228.	Another area of concern is the spread of international terrorism. Last year the General Assembly set up an Ad Hoc Committee on the drafting of an international convention against the taking of hostages. This Committee  as well as the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism  has so far failed to produce the desired positive results. Almost daily we read and hear about terrorist acts which are not confined to any countries or any areas but which threaten the lives of innocent people everywhere.229.	The time has come for this Assembly to take a new and determined approach to this problem which holds potential danger for all Governments and peoples  in order that such brutal use of. force be outlawed by the international community and those who practice it be punished.230.	In southern Africa millions of Africans live in circumstances of degradation and racial discrimination. In South Africa itself the policy of apartheid  repeatedly condemned in United Nations resolutions  continues  and millions of human beings are deprived of their most elementary rights.231.	In spite of the fact that the United Nations terminated the mandate given to South Africa over Namibia  South Africa continues its illegal hold on that Territory. This is a challenge to the international community and cannot be tolerated in any way. My Government does not recognize South Africa as having any jurisdiction over Namibia  and will continue to support all efforts to transfer power to the people of Namibia. Furthermore  my Government believes that South Africa is making a grave mistake by trying to create a fictitious state having the appearance of independence in this area. We also observe with grave concern the fact that South Africa has taken steps to incorporate a part of Namibia into its territory.232.	In Zimbabwe  open warfare is all the news we hear about these days. The illegal minority regime  which holds power only by armed force  denies the rights of the African population. We are outraged by the conduct of the illegal regime in sending military aircraft and armed bands to attack and occupy villages deep inside Zambia  Botswana and Mozambique.233.	Such attacks across international frontiers have already been strongly condemned by the United Nations  and this body should intensify its efforts to provide international aid for the peoples of the devastated areas. It is regrettable that the illegal regime remains blind to the necessity of evolution and makes what will prove to be futile attempts to perpetuate its grip on the people of Zimbabwe. As we have stated on numerous occasions  the implementation of the principle of majority rule is the only solution to the problem of Southern Rhodesia  and we once again reiterate our full support for all efforts to speed up this irreversible process.234.	The recent International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia held in Maputo was an important landmark in the struggle for freedom and independence of those peoples. The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by that Conference showed that the international community is united in its desire to end colonialism and racial discrimination in southern Africa.235.	The fact that the World Conference for Action Against Apartheid held at Lagos adopted its historic declaration by consensus offers ample proof of the determination of the world community to bring about a speedy end to this policy.236.	My country has always opposed colonialism and the policy of apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination. We believe that it will not take long for the last vestiges of colonial domination and racial discrimination to be swept away from the continent of Africa. Iran once again reiterates its support for all efforts to achieve this important objective.237.	Turning now to international economic co-operation  we believe that the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order marked the emergence of a new concept in international economic relations.238.	Although it can be said that negotiations conducted during the seventh special session of the General Assembly  and later on within the framework of UNCTAD  and the Paris Conference contributed to a better understanding of the important issues  we much regret that the expectations of the developing countries are still far from being satisfied. Despite continual negotiations at the United Nations and elsewhere  the agreements reached so far are by no means commensurate with the magnitude of the problems to be faced. The Paris Conference has failed to bring about conditions conducive to the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order.239.	The need for such an order corresponds to nothing less than the complete realization of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.240.	It cannot be denied that an ever widening social and economic gap divides the industrialized countries from what is usually referred to as the third world. While in the industrialized countries attention is mainly focused on civil and political freedoms  the third-world countries are struggling primarily to overcome burdens often imposed upon them by colonialism  exploitation and an obsolete international economic order. Many nations  including my own  are trying to achieve the more difficult task of co-ordinating the requirements of economic democracy with those of political democracy through the development of institutions suitable to their national traditions and their own way of life. The fact  however  remains that among third-world nations many still are at a stage of development where the material needs and the elementary right of their people to a decent life cannot yet be ensured. If nothing is done to bring about the necessary changes  the future will be even gloomier. Let me illustrate some of the things we have to fear.241.	The present world population of 4 billion will increase to about 7 billion by the turn of the century. If the existing economic system persists  three quarters of the inhabitants of our planet will continue to be deprived of the minimum requirements for a decent living.242.	Some 85 per cent of the world's wealth is at the disposal of 15 per cent of its population; arid if this trend is not changed  this disproportion will even increase. The ratio of per capita income in the developed and developing countries is 12 to 1  and in some cases this ratio rises to 60 to 1; and in the field of housing  two thirds of the world's population cannot afford to have even an elementary shelter.243.	Every year 15 million infants below the age of five die because of under nourishment and malnutrition; without prompt action to change this situation  500 million children will starve to death before the end of the century.244.	In these circumstances  it would be naive to think that  by putting the accent exclusively on the civil and political aspects of human rights  one CAN  solve all the problems of the poor and developing countries. Without the satisfaction of basic human needs  how can we expect the vast majority of the people who are sunk in hunger  disease and ignorance to be able to appreciate and effectively enjoy such rights? What  for instance  is the meaning of freedom of choice to a sick  starving and completely ignorant individual? Human rights are indeed indivisible  and it is for this very reason that the realization of each of these rights depends on progress being made in the others.245.	We  of course  support the effort of the international community to promote greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. For our part  we have taken extensive measures in that direction in our own country. Our efforts have always been geared towards ultimate realization of individual rights  social justice and economic democracy in the framework of our own culture  for we believe that each country should find inspiration in its national traditions.246.	However  no matter how much each country strives towards the improvement of the conditions of its people  the problems facing them in an interdependent world such as ours cannot be overcome without co-ordinated cooperation based on a new international economic order.247.	The need to provide assistance to the less developed countries is still intense. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  for their part  have been contributing as much as 2.6 per cent of their gross national product to their fellow developing countries  whereas the developed countries have averaged only close to 0.3 per cent of their gross national product for this purpose. My country continues to assist in the implementation of constructive programmes in the developing countries and has put at their disposal significant financial credits. The ratio of this assistance to our total income has placed my country foremost in the ranks of those providing such international help. Notwithstanding these efforts  the need of the developing countries remains immense. But equally immense is the need of the developed world for a stable supply of raw materials and a stable market for their goods and services.248.	In this connexion  an important development in the field of energy is worth mentioning. Indeed  what was yesterday considered heresay when we were talking about supply and prices has now become gospel.249.	Almost three years ago  when my august Sovereign called for rationalization in the use of oil  and its conservation  and stressed the urgency of developing new and unconventional sources of energy  the industrialized countries gave a discouraging reception to his warning. Now recent developments bear ample witness to the correctness of our approach and to the necessity of intensifying efforts  on a world-wide scale  to achieve those goals.250.	Our countries  members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  while struggling energetically to gain recognition of our legitimate demands  have never failed to show a great sense of responsibility towards the international community.251.	The gap between the positions of the developed and the developing countries is still wide  even at a time when we have to speed up the process of change  the process of bringing the industrialized countries into the development arena as conscientious partners rather than as unwitting adversaries.252.	Whatever the labels on our countries- least developed    developing   or  developed —all of us must realize that we live in one world  a world beset by conflicts  imbalances and injustice  but a world yearning for a decent life for all. This objective cannot be achieved without ensuring economic and social justice.253.	Our ultimate goal should therefore be to join our efforts  not only in solving the political problems of our time  but also in creating conditions under which a just and equitable new international economic order can be established. "
"62",3326,"IRQ",32,1977,"﻿55.	Mr. President  it gives me pleasure to extend to you on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq our warm congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. What makes us all the more proud of your election is the continuing strengthening of the relations of friendship and amity existing between Yugoslavia and Iraq. I should like to commend in particular our close co-operation within the framework of the non-aligned movement  which Iraq considers to be the corner-stone of its foreign policy.56.	I avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the outstanding contribution made by Mr. Amerasinghe  the President of the thirty-first session  and to his wisdom in steering its deliberations. I should like also to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his excellent efforts on behalf of this Organization.57.	During the past two years I have had the privilege from this rostrum of acquainting this esteemed Assembly with the basic principles of the policy of the Republic of Iraq towards the Palestine question. I did this in the context of presenting my country's policy concerning many international issues. This time  however  I should like to confine myself to this central issue  which is of vital concern to us and which we sincerely believe should be the focus of attention of all of us if we really want to establish a lasting and just peace in the Arab region.58.	My country has continued to refuse to recognize the Zionist entity in a consistent policy based upon an objective assessment of how that entity came into being and of its long-term objectives. This policy is founded on our conviction that the emergence of that entity was based on a monstrous injustice and would not have come about had it not been for colonialist collusion between Great Britain and later the United States  on one hand  and world Zionism  on the other. Zionism has acted in concert with the imperialists in Britain ever since the nineteenth century  with Palmerston  Shaftesbury and Disraeli  and later with Chamberlain  Herbert Samuel  Lloyd George and Balfour  the author of the well-known Declaration.59.	It is true that the political and military circumstances of- the First World War played a basic and direct role in Britain's issuing the above Declaration  as admitted by David Lloyd George in his book entitled The Truth about the Peace Treaties  as well as by Chaim Weizmann  Christopher Sykes and others. In the final analysis  however  the decisive factor was the long-term British interest  based on the use of Zionism  in confronting the national liberation movement which had begun to take shape among the Arab masses  thereby threatening the colonial interests of the British Empire. Each party found in the other its natural partner. Imperialism sought a dependable ally through which it would establish a beachhead to achieve its purposes in the Arab region and to safeguard the route to India. Zionism wanted someone to help it to occupy the land of Palestine.60.	Thus  in his bid to enlist the support of Britain  Chaim Weizmann said  in 1904: ... should Palestine fall within the British sphere of influence  and should Britain encourage a Jewish settlement there ... we could have in twenty to thirty years a million Jews out there  perhaps more; they would .. . form a very effective guard for the Suez Canal. 61.	Thus Balfour issued his illegal and immoral Declaration on 2 November 1917  pledging his Government's position of viewing with favour the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine  ignoring thereby the will of the Palestinian Arabs  who constituted 92 per cent of the population and possessed 98 per cent of the land. The Balfour Declaration was the culmination of Herzl's plans expounded at the First Zionist Conference in Basel in 1897 and the efforts of Weizmann  who linked the Zionist programme with the British colonial interests.62.	The Palestinian people rejected the Declaration from the outset  as confirmed by the findings of the King-Crane Commission  which presented its recommendations to the Peace Conference of 1919  stressing the opposition of the overwhelming majority of the population of Palestine to the establishment of a Jewish national home therein.63.	The chapters of the conspiracy began to unfold when Britain occupied Palestine and secured a Mandate over it from the League of Nations. The provisions of the Mandate instrument laid stress on the implementation of the Balfour Declaration.64.	Events later revealed how the mandatory Government enacted a constitution for Palestine incorporating the contents of the Declaration and the instrument as the most important obligations that Britain had to discharge under the Mandate. Britain  in effect  discharged this role: it opened the doors of immigration and liquidated the interests of the Palestinians  and granted the Zionists wide privileges at the expense of the original inhabitants up to the end of the Mandate in 1948. That was the beginning of the conspiracy.65.	At the time of the Balfour Declaration the Arabs constituted  as I have already stated  92 per cent of the population and the Jews 7.9 per cent. As a result of the encouragement of the biased mandatory authority  the Jewish population began to increase. In 1922 the percentage of the Jewish population in relation to the whole population became 11.1 per cent  and in 1931 it rose to 18.6 per cent. In 1944 the percentage of the Jewish population reached 31 per cent.66.	In spite of this flagrant violation of the rights of the Palestinian people  the Arab population at the end of 1946  that is  on the eve of the adoption of the partition resolution  stood at about 1.25 million  whereas the number of Jews  in spite of the rapid rise in immigration  remained at 600 000.67.	Ever since the establishment of the first Zionist settlement in Palestine in 1886  the Palestinian Arab people resisted this Zionist onslaught with a determination far beyond their meagre means of defence. They expressed rejection through various forms of struggle  culminating in their great revolution in 1936  which lasted three years  during which they held the longest strike in the history of the land in protest against the dual enemy represented by Zionist colonialism and the British Mandate. The toll among the Palestinian Arab people  which numbered 1 million at the time  was over 5 000 killed and 15 000 wounded. The British forces suppressed the revolution by resorting to various modern weapons such as tanks and aircraft. Large numbers of troops were used to quell the revolution. More than 5 600 Arabs were arrested and 54 were sentenced to death. The British mandatory authority declared a state of emergency in Palestine in order to divest the Palestinian Arab people of their arms and imposed the heaviest penalties for the possession of arms  including sticks. At the same time the Zionist terror organizations were stockpiling weapons with the approval and assistance of the mandatory authority. This assistance was acknowledged by Ben-Gurion in his article published in The JewishObserver on 27 September 1963. 68.	Those were the roots of the conspiracy  in which many evil efforts were combined and which paved the way for the establishment of the Zionist entity in Palestine in flagrant violation of the values cherished by the international community.69.	The second blow was perpetrated when the same conspiratorial forces impelled the United Nations General Assembly to adopt resolution 181 (II)  partitioning Palestine  in the year 1947. By so doing  the United Nations violated its own Charter and overstepped its mandate  since  in contravention of the sacred right to self-determination set forth in Article 1 of the Charter  it prescribed a political status for the great majority of the population of Palestine without consulting them  and thereby paved the way for the greatest political tragedy of our time.70.	The partition resolution categorically violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter  whose objectives relating to the future of the peoples covered by the Trusteeship System were defined in Article 76 as the promotion of the  advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories  and their progressive development towards self-government or independence  in accordance with  the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned ... .71.	Instead of placing Palestine  which was then held under Mandate  under the Trusteeship System in accordance with Article 77 of the Charter or granting the Palestinian people the right to self-determination in accordance with Article 1 of the Charter  the General Assembly adopted its resolution partitioning Palestine under the pressure of the imperialist countries and the Zionist movement. Even the partition resolution-towards whose adoption the Zionist pressure groups in the United States worked so assiduously to influence undecided States  notably some in Latin America-was ignored and never implemented by the Zionist entity.72.	The Zionist entity has so far ignored 109 resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and 82 resolutions adopted by the Security Council since 1947 until this very day. It has not abided by any of these resolutions.73.	It should be noted in this connexion that the admission of the Zionist entity to the world Organization was conditional upon its acceptance of resolution 194 (III) of 1948  which provided in paragraph 11 for the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland. That was never honoured by the Zionist entity  which to this day is continually obstructing the work of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people. In this connexion  I wish to pay a warm tribute to that Committee for its constructive and objective work.74.	Another example of the wanton disregard by the Zionist entity of the resolutions of the world Organization is its refusal to admit the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories set up by the General Assembly. I would be remiss if 1 failed to pay a tribute to the efforts of the Special Committee. Its unbiased work deserves the admiration of all.75.	Yet another of the numerous examples of the wanton conduct of the Zionist entity is its refusal since 1967 to  apply the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 to the occupied Arab territories in spite of Security Council resolution 237(1967).76.	The statement of Yigal Allon in the Knesset  published in Ha'aretz on 1 August 1975  to the effect that whether Israel is inside or outside the United Nations is of no importance  in their view  as the only effect of its membership is merely psychological  again demonstrates the low esteem in which the world Organization is held by the Zionist entity.77.	No sooner had the Zionists achieved their first colonialist dream than they widely opened the door of immigration at the expense of the Palestinian people  the rightful owners of Palestine. They pursued every means and enacted all kind of laws for the liquidation of the Palestinian people and their replacement by alien Zionist immigrants. In 1950 they introduced the Law of Return which gave every Jew in the world the right to immigrate to Palestine and acquire Israeli nationality upon arrival. They also enacted the nationality law of 1952 and its amendments granting nationality to the Jews and withholding it from the indigenous Arab population of the country.78.	Apart from the foregoing  a number of laws were enacted during the period 1948-1960 relating to land. Some of these laws provide for the confiscation of land—that is  of course  the confiscation of Arab land and its transfer to the Zionists. There was also the law on the acquisition of the absentees' property  The Absentees' Property Law  which considered any Arab who was absent from his home for any period of time  even for only a few hours  to be an absentee. The property was then taken over by the military authorities and the owner was considered to have obstructed the establishment of the Zionist entity. Under that law  the property of 30 000 Arabs was confiscated in 1962. There is also the Law of Prescription and the Law for the Concentration of Agricultural Land. All these laws aim at dispossessing the Arabs of their agricultural land. Of 370 Jewish settlements established in the period 1948-1953  350 were established on the lands of displaced Arabs. In 1954 more than one third of the Jewish population was settled on the lands of absentees and in their property and homes. The Arabs who remained in Palestine were not safe from the large-scale process of usurpation. Up to 1976  a total of 40 per cent of the lands belonging to the Arabs who were present was confiscated.79.	Furthermore  the Zionist entity enforced the notorious Defence (Emergency) Regulations  which were legislated by the British mandatory authorities in 1945 and about which the Zionist Shapiro  who later became the Minister of Justice  bitterly complained  saying that the regulations had no parallel in any civilized country  not even in Nazi Germany. Upon becoming Minister of Justice  Shapiro himself supervised the application of that law to the Arabs alone.80.	All these laws prove beyond any shadow of doubt the racist nature of the Zionist entity  which is a discriminatory society based on purely religious foundations and is  as such  very similar to the racist regimes in Africa. I need hardly remind you of the inhuman treatment meted out to the oriental Jews in the Zionist entity which led many of them to long for their previous homelands. The radical change in the membership - of the United Nations in the interest of the peoples of the world and the weakening of the grip of the imperialist Powers on the world Organization enabled the General Assembly to adopt its memorable resolution 3379 (XXX) considering Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. We all know the panic that gripped the Zionist movement as a result of the adoption of that resolution  which made the Zionists and their supporters resort without avail to all kind of pressures before and after its adoption.81.	So much for the racist nature of the Zionist entity. As regards its atrocities in Palestine  they are too many to (enumerate. It is enough for me to remind the Assembly of the Deir Yasin massacre perpetrated on 12 April 1948 by the terrorist gang of the Irgun Zvei Leumi under the leadership of Menachem Begin  who boasted of the crime as a victory which spared the Zionist entity the presence of half a million Arabs who  as a consequence  fled their homeland in panic. Now let us hear the comment of Jacques de Reynier  the senior representative of the International Red Cross Committee  on the massacre: Three hundred persons were massacred without any military reason or provocation of any kind: old men  women  children newly-born were savagely murdered with grenades and knives by Jewish troops of the Irgun entirely under the control and direction of their chiefs. M. de Reynier described Zionist troops he met on the scene of the massacre as:.. men and women armed with pistols  sub-machine guns and large bayonets most of which were still bloodstained. 82.	That was followed by the massacre of Kafr Kassim in 1956 and the massacre of Qibya and hundreds of other atrocities which were a blot on humanity  but whose perpetrators unabashedly attach the label of terrorism inherent in them to those who are struggling to regain their rights to their homeland.83.	In spite of the attempts of the Zionist entity to cover up its expanding relations with the racist entities in southern Africa  the international community has concentrated on those relations  to such an extent that they were condemned by the international. Organization through various resolutions. The relationship between the Zionist entity and the racist entity in South Africa dates back to the undertaking by Smuts to Weizmann to adopt the cause of Zionism. That is evidenced by Vorster's statement published by Hayom Haze  which is as follows: Israel is the twin sister of South Africa. Like South Africa  it is dominated by a white racist regime  which is keen on keeping the blacks as hewers of wood and drawers of water as ordained by God. 84.	One should not really wonder at that: the Zionist entity and South Africa are both based on settler colonialism. Each of them seized the land of the indigenous population of the country through illegitimate ways and means  wrested their ownership from the citizens and has remained in power through brute force. Both of them are actively engaged in transforming the indigenous population into strangers. On the one hand there is a Zionist movementpersecuting the Palestinian people  and on the other an Afrikaner nation persecuting the Africans. One is a racist movement engaged in emptying Palestine of its Arab population and replacing them by Zionists with the aim of expanding and implementing the programmes of Zionism  and the other is a racist movement which exploited the great majority of the population of South Africa and expanded at the expense of Namibia. Just as the United Nations General Assembly adopted numerous resolutions calling upon South Africa to renounce the policy of apartheid after the Western Powers had continued to oppose such resolutions on the pretext that the UnitedNations was not competent to discuss it  so the self-same Assembly adopted in 1975 its historic resolution 1 3379 (XXX) which determined that Zionism was a form of j racism  after the nature of Zionism had become know to all. j There is a distinct similarity between Zionism and apartheid. Both movements represent imported minorities j planted in the lands of peoples struggling for their rights; both of them developed under British imperialism and have remained in existence through tyrannical force and imperialist support. That also wholly applies to the racist regime in Rhodesia.85.	One of the racist manifestations of the Zionist entity is its failure to become a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. It signed the first convention in 1966 but failed to ratify it  and has not even signed the second.86.	The present Prime Minister of the Zionist entity revealed his views on the relations between the two racist entities when he made the following statement during his visit to South Africa in 1968: Israel is considered to be part of the Western world. Hence its presence in the area serves the West. It is furthermore a perpetuation of the Western presence in the area. Israel must therefore stretch its hand to its allies in South Africa and Rhodesia which are part of the Western world and the product of its civilization amidst backward areas. 87.	The expansionist policy of the Zionist entity is the manifestation in practice of the Zionist expansionist ideology  which has laid emphasis ever since its inception on the necessity for expansion. Kerzl's reply to an inquiry about the frontiers of the land they seek to secure was as follows:  We demand what we need; the more the number of immigrants increases  the more our need for land increases. 88.	The idea of the establishment of  the State of Israel  has passed through stages from the mere call to allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine  to the claim for a national home under British Mandate and the demand made publicly at the Zionist Conference  held in the Biltmore Hotel in New York in 1942  for the establishment of a Zionist State and the termination of the Mandate. The same applies to the frontiers of the Zionist State. After the Zionist movement had hailed the victory achieved through the adoption of the partition resolution  the Zionist entity managed to expand its geographical area through the 1948 war by around 50 per cent more than the original area allotted to it by the partition resolution  and began to denounce that resolution and to refuse to implement it. It is obvious that the 1948 frontiers were never the end of the road for the ambitions of the Zionist expansionists. In this connexion  after the 1948 war Ben-Gurion said: Certain circumstances will arise in the future  and we must make use of these circumstances to expand the boundaries and borders of the State. If such circumstances do not arise  we must create them ourselves. 89.	Thus the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956 was an operation aimed at creating new circumstances for a new expansion. The claim by the Zionist leadership  before the 1956 invasion  that the provisions of the armistice agreements of 1949 had acquired permanence  as stated by the Permanent Representative of the Zionist entity before the Security Council in 1951  came as no surprise. But the Zionist entity completely reversed its attitude after the 1956 war according to the statement by Israel ending compliance with the armistice agreement with Egypt in the aide-memoire presented by Israel on 4 November 1956 to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Lastly came the aggression of 1967 to triple the area occupied by the Zionist entity.90.	It is well known that the Zionist entity is the only one in the world whose fundamental laws do not provide for the delimitation of fixed borders for the country. The delimitation of the borders was actually left to the material and military capability of the entity. In the words of Golda Meir  the former Prime Minister of the Zionist entity:  The international borders of Israel are determined according to where the Jews settle.  That explains the great effort exerted by the Zionist entity to establish Zionist settlements in the Arab territories occupied after the 1967 war.91.	The Zionist movement has always camouflaged its expansionist ambitions by slogans and pretexts. In a memorandum presented by the representatives of the Zionist Organisation to the Peace Conference on 3 February 1919 under the title  Statement of the Zionist Organization on Palestine   those representatives proposed that the frontiers of Palestine should extend from near the town of Sidon in the north to the Hedjaz Railway  eastwards down to Akaba  and to the Mediterranean on the west. As to the southern border  this was to be left to negotiation. It is interesting to note that the justification by the Zionist organization at the time for demanding such frontiers was not based on religious but on economic grounds. In the words of the memorandum:  The boundaries above outlined are what we consider essential for the necessary economic foundation of the country. 92.	Now we hear the cry of  secure and defensible borders   taken up in the wake of the 1967 war  to justify further Zionist expansion  not only at the expense of the territory of the people of Palestine  but to cover the territories of other Arab States which were taken from them by force of arms. In this connexion  I need hardly recall the United Nations resolutions which repeatedly stress the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force  such as the resolutions of the General Assembly on the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai after the 1956 war  and the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly on Israel's withdrawal from the territories occupied after the 1967 war  and on the illegality of the annexation of the Arab city of Jerusalem. Yet the Zionist entity defies all these international documents and resolutions and insists on territorial expansion  depending on its military force and on United States imperialist support  thereby corroborating Hitler's saying:  The borders established by men can be changed by men   and Mussolini's famous saying:  The growth and expansion of a State are a basic sign of its vitality; the opposite is a sign of its decline. 93.	The latest decisions of Begin's Government to legalize three settlements on the West Bank  to establish additional settlements and to extend Zionist laws to the population of the West Rank conclusively demonstrate the expansionist policy of the Zionist entity and the extent of the Begin Governments’ contempt for world public opinion.94.	Arab fears about the Zionist entity and the Zionist movement are the product of our long experience  and of bitter reality  which have convinced us that Zionism is an aggressive movement seeking the destruction of the Arab nation and the elimination of all that is Arab. It is the tool of neo-colonialism in the region  working hand in hand for their mutual interest in stemming the progress of the Arabs and impeding their renaissance and unity. The refusal of the Zionist entity to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and the statements concerning its possession of a number of nuclear weapons  confirm our view.95.	Just as the African national movement is struggling against the doctrine of colonialism and racism represented by the white man  and just as Europe struggled against fascism represented by the Hitlerite Nazi regime  so is the Arab national movement struggling against Zionism and its institutions.96.	Just as the rout of nazism as a doctrine has opened the way to living in peace with the Germans in Europe  the defeat of the apartheid regimes in Africa and of Zionism in Palestine will open new way to the coexistence of white and blacks in Africa and Arabs and Jews in the Arab world  particularly since a large percentage of those residing within the Zionist entity are from the Arab countries.97.	The establishment of a secular democratic State on the unified land of Palestine will guarantee the rights of all sects and minorities. The era of settler colonialism has gone forever. Palestine is the land of the Palestinian people  who should decide their destiny by themselves. All those who came for colonialist ends should evacuate the country. That is the permanent solution which will achieve real peace. Other solutions are but manoeuvres aimed at consolidating aggression and expansion through a series of gradual processes leading to the ultimate aim charted by Zionism and colonialism  which is the destruction of the Arab nation and the occupation of its lands.98.	That is the truth about the Palestinian question. Can the world Organization do anything for the cause of right  justice and peace? Yes  it can  by dealing with the following questions.99.	First of all  the Zionist entity is occupying- the territories of three Arab countries-Egypt  Syria and Jordan-in contravention of international law and of manyUnited Nations resolutions. It is the responsibility of the international Organization to end the occupation of the territories of its Member States. It can impose on the Zionist entity the appropriate sanctions to force it to withdraw from those territories unconditionally and without any political gain.100.	Secondly  any support extended to the Zionist movement leads to increased tension and the perpetuation of the conflict in the Arab region  which in turn constitutes a threat to world peace. The United States military supplies to the Zionist entity constitute the most salient form of such support  which has made the United States the main supplier of modern  sophisticated weapons to Tel Aviv— apart from the financial support given by the United States  which has reached astronomical figures. In a comment made by Senator William Fullbright in the wake of the second Sinai Agreement  signed in 1975  he said it was expected that during the coming five years United States financial assistance to Israel would reach $9.9 billion.101.	As for Itzhak Rabin  he said in an introduction to the 1977 Yearbook of his Government: We contribute only 45 agorot from our sweat for each Israeli pound entering the regular budget  whereas the rest comes from the United States and from loans and donations by the Jewish people. 102.	Thirdly  the other aspect of the process of support for the Zionist entity takes the form of immigration to that entity. The active encouragement of immigration to Palestine by world Zionism bears the dangerous seeds of the need for more land  causing expansion—which is bound to lead to more wars and the perpetuation of the displacement of the people of Palestine.103.	We believe in the necessity of a General Assembly initiative to discuss this question and take such measures as will condemn and halt this immigration to Palestine.104.	Fourthly  ever since the adoption of the partition resolution  the world Organization has adopted a series of resolutions which stress the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and their right to self-determination  particularly resolution 3236 (XXIX). The setting up of the 20-member Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people was a positive step. The recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly at its last session stressing the necessity of working towards the return of the Palestinian people to their land were based on an unequivocal and specific programme. But we are now witnessing a series of economic  political and military measures taken by the Zionist entity aimed at the further displacement of Palestinians from the occupied Arab territories  whether in the Gaza Strip or on the West Bank. We call upon the United Nations and its specialized agencies to pay due attention to these dangerous manifestations and to prevent their further escalation through the drawing up of economic  cultural  health and social programmes to enable the Arab population to remain in the occupied territories.105.	Fifthly  the United Nations constitutes the natural and sound framework for discussion of the question of Palestine with the participation of the representatives of the Palestinian people. The attempt to circumvent the world Organization and the attempt by certain parties to monopolize the settlement of the question through conferences will not. be helpful in finding a sound solution to the problem  because the aim of such parties is not really the solution of the problem but the mere stabilization of the conflict  leaving all the elements and factors of contradiction and discord latent in the area. The United Nations was responsible for the birth of the Palestinian tragedy when the Organization was under the control of the colonialist minority. Today the United Nations  having become more universal and representative of the peoples of the world  is in a better position to put an end to the tragedy. We are against any weakening of the role of the United Nations in resolving the question of Palestine.106.	Sixthly  the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East is no longer sheer imagination. Various indications and information point to the determination of the Zionist entity to acquire nuclear weapons. In an interview on French television in February 1976 Moshe Dayan said:  The future  for Israel  should include the option and possibility of possessing nuclear weapons  without foreign supervision.  The United States Central Intelligence Agency reported last year that Israel possesses 10 to 20 atomic bombs ready for use.107.	It is necessary to take speedy and serious steps to translate the United Nations resolution on the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East into practical measures and to expose the obstructionists. The spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East not only constitutes a massive danger to the peoples of the region  but could also be the fuse that would set off a world-wide explosion. The failure of the international Organization to play its part in preventing the Zionist entity from continuing to produce nuclear weapons would impel the other States in the area to defend themselves with the same weapons.108.	Seventhly  and finally  it should be noted that if we want this world Organization to fulfil its mission and gain the confidence of the peoples of the world  its Members must shoulder their responsibilities. The United Nations is what its Members want it to be. Proceeding from this premise  we believe in taking serious steps to prevent the resolutions of this Organization from remaining merely ink on paper. Nor should a Member of this Organization be allowed to become so brazen as to tear up and ignore the resolutions of the Organization  as the representative of the Zionist entity has done and is still doing.109.	The admission of the Zionist entity to membership in the United Nations was conditional upon its acceptance and implementation of United Nations resolutions. Nevertheless we find Tel Aviv  after 30 years and the adoption of more than 200 resolutions by the General Assembly and the Security Council  ignoring and rejecting the implementation of the various United Nations resolutions.110.	Are we to adopt further resolutions that will not be implemented  or has the time come to take deterrent action against the continuance of wanton behaviour by the Zionist entity and its flouting of United Nations resolutions? We believe that the expulsion of that entity from this Organization would constitute a sound step in the right direction. 	"
"63",3373,"ISL",32,1977,"﻿312.	Every year  as custom has it  we review here major developments in international relations at the beginning of the session of the General Assembly. I want to do exactly that and present the Icelandic viewpoint on major international events in the past 12 months. In summary form  I will touch on conflicts  co-operation and continued work on improving the human condition.313.	But first of all let me say that it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your active participation in the work of the Organization on behalf of your country is well known and will undoubtedly contribute to your success in dealing with the many problems now on the agenda.314.	Permit me also to express our great appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  for the wise and efficient manner in which he dealt with the difficult tasks facing the Assembly. Again 1 want to express the gratitude of my country for his contribution to the efforts to bring to a successful conclusion the incredibly complicated work of the law of the sea Conference.315.	We now have two new Members of the United Nations: The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. I am very happy to welcome them into this community of nations  and 1 feel certain their co-operation and contributions to our Organization will be of great value.316.	The Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and his staff have continued their tireless and determined efforts on behalf of the United Nations to preserve peace and to carry out the many mandates given to them. Permit me to convey our gratitude and our respect to the Secretary-General and his staff and to assure him of our full support in the future as hitherto.317.	The year that has passed since we last met in this hall cannot be said to have been characterized by great achievements in the field of international relations. There have  however  been no great set-backs  so perhaps in that sense it may be said that developments have been on the positive side. The fighting that broke out recently in the area of the Horn of Africa must be mentioned as an exception  and it is of course always a great tragedy when disputes  whatever their cause  turn into bloody armed conflicts in which there is no regard for human lives or human suffering.318.	The problems facing the United Nations are many and immensely complex  and in some instances highly sensitive and dangerous  and their solution is a matter of survival for civilization in the world as we know it today.319.	The Charter of the United Nations gives us the platform on which to build our efforts to find solutions  and the Organization is the instrument we must use in those efforts. It is easy to place the blame on our Organization and to hold forth on theories of divergence in the development of our institutions  on the one hand  and the developments in international relations and the great advances in technology  on the other. I have said this before  but I will repeat it here: no organization is greater than the individual members that compose it. We have our Organization and we must use it to attain the ideals expressed in the Charter. There is undoubtedly some need for institutional changes for the sake of efficiency and for budgetary reasons  but we see no need for a revision of the Charter for the present.320.	We have a saying in Iceland that the bad oarsman blames the oar. When political expediency at home  conflicts of interest  or even bad faith prevent the placing of a problem before the United Nations  we too often hear voices blaming it on the short-comings of the United Nations system. But  I repeat  we have the instrument and we must use it as it was intended by the framers of the Charter: to preserve peace in the world.321.	When I stated before that some of the problems facing us are highly dangerous  I had in mind  first and foremost  the ever-increasing pace of the arms race  the danger of proliferation of nuclear weapons  the traffic in fissionable materials and the production of new weapons of mass destruction  be they nuclear  chemical or biological.322.	In but a few days the interim agreement reached at the first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1972 will come to an end. This is a very serious development  which has fortunately been somewhat eased by the announcement by both parties that they will abide by the terms of the agreement while efforts continue to be made to reach a new agreement on the limitation of strategic nuclear arms.323.	It is in my opinion vital that these two Powers come to an agreement in this matter and that progress is made in other regional disarmament discussions so that they might become wider in scope and be extended to other areas.324.	Agreements in the sphere of disarmament between the two Powers is in my belief the basis for what has become known as detente and there is no acceptable alternative to the policy of detente in the world. All efforts at all levels should be made to further that policy. I therefore welcome the results of the preparatory work in Belgrade and the follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which is to convene in a few days from now. I consider this an important step in the right direction.325.	With the total destructive power of nuclear armaments  increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of the so-called conventional weapons  and the traffic in them has been escalating very rapidly. The need for control is essential and should be established as soon as possible on a regional or an international scale  whichever would be more effective.The proliferation of nuclear weapons must be prevented and all nations should be urged to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.327.	By the same token  there should be close supervision of the traffic in fissionable materials intended for peaceful use to prevent their use for military purposes. Such supervision should be in the hands of the United Nations.328.	Furthermore  an agreement on a comprehensive treaty to ban all nuclear testing is a matter of great importance.329.	The Icelandic delegation will support all efforts to make the forthcoming special session a successful one as disarmament is an. essential element in the establishment and maintenance of peace in the world.330.	The work of the United Nations in the sphere of human rights is of paramount interest and importance. Much has been gained  but much is still to be done. The plight of political prisoners has to be alleviated and torture in all its forms must be prevented. What is needed is close co-operation so  that an effective international review of how human rights are respected or abused can be carried out. There should be instituted effective measures to protect the innocent against international terrorism in all its aspects.331.	In other words  the protection of the individual and his rights is  and continues to be  the main task of the United Nations. Although in legal terms our Organization is composed of sovereign States  its efforts should be concentrated on improving human conditions.332.	Where there is hunger  misery and social injustice  we cannot expect the advancement of human rights. Therefore  the more equitable distribution of the world's wealth through improved international economic relations is a question of basic rights.333.	Iceland supported the resolutions on the new international economic order and the economic rights and duties of States. The implementation of the provisions of these resolutions has been slow but some progress has been made. The North-South dialogue must continue in all appropriate forums. The resumed session of the thirty-first General Assembly could not come to an agreement on assessing the results of the Paris Conference  but it is to be hoped that this session will make major efforts in this important field and a consensus will emerge on the next steps to be taken to enhance a more just and equitable international economic order  and thus improve the situation of developing countries in the international community.334.	Any mention of human rights automatically brings us to the problem of apartheid. The situation in South Africa is becoming more and more serious. The Icelandic delegation will support all practical measures taken by the United Nations to stop the inhumane policy of discrimination carried out by the Government of South Africa and the brutal measures of suppression we constantly hear about from that country. I should like to state here that recently the foreign ministers of the Nordic countries established a working group to investigate what further economic measures may be instituted against South Africa.335.	We also want to express our support for the efforts now being made to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Namibia  and any action which might jeopardize these activities should be discouraged. We continue to work to attain our goal-the full independence of that country—in conformity with Security Council resolution 385 (1976).336.	It is the opinion of my delegation that all proposals which would lead to a peaceful  negotiated transition of power to the majority in Zimbabwe should be supported so that the social injustice practised by the minority on the majority is brought to an end as soon as possible.337.	The problem of Cyprus does not  unfortunately  appear to be close to a solution. The Secretary-General and his staff continue their valiant efforts to bring the two factions together  and it is to be hoped that neither party  by its action  widens the gap further  thus making the task of the Secretary-General more difficult than it is now. As I have said in this Assembly  any solution to this difficult problem must take into account the maintenance of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.338.	The value of the United Nations peace-keeping forces is clearly demonstrated in this case as it is in other parts of the world.339.	The situation in the Middle East remains serious  although there is at the moment greater hope than before that it will be possible to reconvene the Geneva Conference. We must all be hopeful that this preliminary step towards negotiation of a lasting peace in this troubled area can be taken. I want to reiterate my belief that any solution should be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973).340.	It is worthwhile remembering that those resolutions state that acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable  that Israel must cease its occupation of territories seized in 1967  and that the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of all the States in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries must be respected.341.	Here it should also be stated that any solution must recognize the Palestinians' right to a homeland  and the Palestinians for their part must recognize the right of Israel to exist. It is  furthermore  the opinion of the Icelandic delegation that the Palestinians should participate in the negotiations for a peaceful solution in a manner to be worked out in consultation with the parties concerned.342.	The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held in New York from 23 May to 15 July 1977. There is now before the Conference an informal composite negotiating text which was prepared by the President of the Conference and the Chairmen of the main committees on the basis of discussions at the session. It was decided that that text would be before the Conference at its next session beginning in Geneva on 27 March 1978 and expected to last for eight weeks. Furthermore  it is expected that inter-sessional meetings will be held in the intervening period.343.	The text which is now before the Conference reinforces the status of the economic zone. In accordance with articles 61 and 62  it is for the coastal State to determine the allowable catch in the zone as well as its own capacity to harvest it. Articles 69 and 70 provide certain rights for geographically disadvantaged States  but pursuant to article 71 those rights do not apply in the case of States whose population is overwhelmingly dependent on the fisheries within the zone. Furthermore  article 296 excludes from submission to third-party dispute settlement the decisions under articles 61 and 62-that is  as I have already mentioned  with respect to the allowable catch and the State's capacity. The new text is therefore very favourable for coastal States  which have worked together extensively at the Conference. The new text also has revised articles concerning pollution and scientific research  and they are not expected to create any great difficulties.344.	On the other hand  there remains major disagreement on problems with respect to the international sea-bed area  and the industrial countries do not consider that their interests are sufficiently accommodated. Those problems will be the subject of intensive work at the informal inter-sessional meetings. Because of the great differences of view the next session cannot be foreseen as the last before the signing of a convention; however  as we have already heard in this Assembly  opinions differ on this point.345.	My Government's view is that the concept of the exclusive economic zone now has a solid foundation in international law It would of course be an advantage to have it incorporated in a formal convention on the law of the sea. For that purpose a further concentrated effort must be made to solve the remaining issues in the total package  notably in the field of the international sea-bed area. However  nations cannot be expected to devote unlimited time and expenditure for that purpose.346.	As the Conference on the Law of the Sea has hitherto been characterized by the determination of all participants to find practical solutions in all the categories of the mandate it was given  I am convinced there is every reason to hope that agreement will be reached by consensus on the outstanding issues. It is a fact that legislation is the more effective the more closely it represents the sense of justice of those who have to live by it.347.	It is therefore our hope that a general convention on the law of the sea can be signed in the course of next year.348.	I have touched upon the need to respect the freedom and the human rights of every individual. I have expressed the hope that times of force and violence will soon become a thing of the past  and the conviction that mankind's future should rest upon continued international co-operation where all meet as equals and where even the smallest contribution could be decisive.349.	Continuing that line of thought  one could perhaps reflect on what yardstick should be used in measuring the greatness and influence of individuals and nations. Halldor Laxness  an Icelandic Nobel Prize winner  stated it in the following way in one of his books: Often I think the Almighty is like a snow-bunting abandoned in all weathers. Such a bird is about the weight of a postage stamp. Yet he does not blow away when he stands in the open in a tempest. Have you ever seen the skull of a snow-bunting? He wields his fragile head against the gale  with his beak to the ground  wings folded close to his sides and his tail pointing upwards  and the wind can get no hold on him and cleaves. Even in the fiercest squalls the bird does not budge. He is becalmed. Not a single feather stirs. Then the question is asked: How do you know that the bird is the Almighty and not the wind? And the answer: Because the winter storm is the most powerful force in Iceland and the snow-bunting is the feeblest of all God's ideas. 350.	In my opinion  therefore  it is in many cases very unwise to exclude even those who at first glance seem to be rather feeble  because they may well possess the inner strength that the strongest power is not able to break.351.	My wish for the United Nations is now  as it has always been  that it will continue to be the citadel of human rights and independence for all people on this earth  whether they belong to big or small nations  whether they are powerful in the word  because the fiercest of snowstorms very often cleaves apart against even the feeblest of all God's ideas. "
"64",3420,"ISR",32,1977,"﻿154.	Mr. President  permit me to join those representatives who have already spoken in the debate  and have offered their congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.155.	The cause of human rights received a powerful impetus this year when the President of the United States told this body on 17 March of this year that every nation has a responsibility to speak out in defence of basic rights and freedoms throughout the world. We subscribed fully to this view and we are proud that  despite intense strains and provocations  Israel has succeeded in maintaining a free  open and multiracial society in which the dignity of man and the rule of law are held supreme.156.	Unfortunately  the record of the United Nations in the field of human rights is poor. We are witnesses here to a deplorable exercise in double standards and cynicism.157.	We have also been disappointed that so little progress has been made in implementing the humanitarian principles of the Final Act of Helsinki. Regrettably  there has been no improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Exit from the Soviet Union  the right to leave one's country a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Final Act of Helsinki—is still severely restricted  and those Jews who do insist on their rights are subject to continued harassment by the authorities  to dismissal from their places of employment and in some cases to arrest and imprisonment. The Government of Israel once again calls on the Soviet Union to permit those Jews who wish to do so to leave in order to go to Israel to join their people and their families.158.	May I again raise the matter of the sorry plight of the Jewish community in Syria. That community does not enjoy such basic human rights as freedom of movement or the right to be reunited with their families. There can be no valid reason for the Government of Syria to hold those 5 000 innocent people as hostages.159.	Ever since it joined the United Nations some 28 years ago  Israel has steadily supported all significant moves by this Organization to promote and to propagate the limitation of armaments on a global scale. Although disarmament has always been closely linked with security  Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race in the Middle East.160.	In the past three years  an estimated $US 7.5 billion in arms supplies have been delivered by East and West to Arab countries in the vicinity of Israel. In addition  about $US 22 billion worth of arms was contracted for by Arab States for delivery from the end of 1976 onwards. Israel is ready to enter into an agreement on arms limitation with all the States in the Middle East.161.	With regard to another crucial aspect of disarmament  Israel has frequently called on its Arab neighbours to join it in direct negotiations with a view to establishing a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. Indeed  on this issue as on others  the Foreign Minister of Egypt  Mr. Fahmy  has deliberately misled this Assembly. Israel firmly believes that such negotiations should lead to the conclusion of a formal  contractual  multilateral convention between all the States of the region  on the lines of such notable precedents as the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America and the proposals for similar agreements in the areas of south Asia and the south Pacific. Unfortunately  the Arab States have totally rejected this call by Israel which  after all  is in the interests of all the people of the Middle East. On this occasion I repeat our proposal.162.	A year ago  following the rescue by Israel of innocent hostages hijacked to Entebbe in an Air France airbus  the Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany proposed that the United Nations should draft an international convention banning the taking of hostages and providing for the prosecution or extradition of the ""criminals. This was an important step in the right direction  which Israel welcomed. It is therefore very disturbing to note that the Ad Hoc Committee appointed to deal with this matter has made so little progress in attempting to draft a convention for consideration by this Assembly. If this Organization fails  because of the efforts of those who support international terror  to take even this step in the right direction  then it will have lost all credibility as an effective instrument of international action.163.	It is regrettable that Arab States have played and continue to play a central role in encouraging international terror. It is to Arab airports that hijacked aircraft are directed by terrorists in their search for safe destinations. The recent Japan Air Lines case is a classic example. The kidnappers and murderers of public figures in Germany are graduates of the courses of the PLO.164.	No cause can justify or condone terrorism. Terrorism is a criminal activity  totally indiscriminate in its effects  which by design strikes at the innocent and the defenceless. The issue is therefore a fundamental one for the international community. The attitude this Organization takes on the question of terrorism is a clear reflection of its moral strength and its international responsibility.165.	So far  the record of the United Nations in combating terrorism is dismal. Not once has the Security Council convened to condemn terrorists and hijackers.166.	I noted with interest that  after my Egyptian colleague had talked with the President and the Secretary of State in Washington on 22 September  he announced to the press that  for the first time  Egypt was prepared to accept Israel as a Middle Eastern country and to live in peace in that area. It saddened me therefore that  before this Assembly on 28 September  Mr. Fahmy chose to make a personal attack on my Prime Minister and to vilify Zionism and to launch a move to isolate Israel in this forum. He also made peace conditional on an end to immigration to Israel  and openly threatened war. It would be easy to rebut him  but I shall refrain. I shall only comment that Mr. Fahmy's double-talk does not enhance Egypt's credibility and is prejudicial to the prospects of peace in the Middle East.167.	Israel will never limit immigration. Zionism is the life-blood of Israel. We will do our utmost to achieve peace and to prevent war; but let me remind Mr. Fahmy  when he threatens us with war  that every war launched by Egypt has ended to its considerable disadvantage. The last cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Egypt after the Yom Kippur war took place 101 kilometres from Cairo. I submit that it would be more appropriate for Mr. Fahmy to stop talking about war and concentrate on the issues of peace.168.	Similarly  I shall not engage in polemics with any of the other Arab representatives who have made countless false and malicious allegations against Israel.169.	However  certain facts must be recalled. We have been reminded that General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 1947 on the partition of Palestine has not been implemented. True  but the Arab States themselves voted against that resolution  obstructed its implementation and destroyed it by force of arms. For the last 30 years they have been guilty of aggression against Israel.170.	After every war we proposed peace  but in vain. After the 1948 war we negotiated with Abdullah  King of Jordan. We reached an agreement  which was initialled by both sides  but because of that he was assassinated by his own people while praying at the A1 Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. In 1957  we proposed to President Nasser of Egypt that Egyptian troops  and not United Nations troops  should take over Sharm el Sheikh  which controls the Strait of Tiran  on condition that Israeli vessels be guaranteed freedom of passage  but Nasser rejected our proposal. After the 1967 war  we offered to negotiate for peace: we offered to return territory in return for peace. The reply we received from the Arab countries was given to us on 1 September 1967 at the Arab Summit Conference: no negotiation  no recognition  no peace.171.	Many representatives have referred nostalgically to the 1967 armistice lines  and seem to see an Israeli withdrawal to them as a complete solution to all the problems of the Middle East. But if the 1967 lines are the answer to the problem  why is it that peace was not achieved in the years between 1949 and 1967  when Israel's frontiers were at the pre-1967 lines? During that period the Arab States refused to negotiate peace  as they were pledged to do under the armistice agreements which they signed in 1949. The PLO  an instrument of war for the destruction of Israel  was created in 1964 when Israel was still behind the 1967 lines.172.	There has been much talk about the territories held by Israel since the six day war. But nothing has been said about the reasons for that war; nothing of President Nasser's blockade of the Strait of Tiran and his public undertakings to annihilate Israel; nothing of Egypt's movement of forces leading up to the war; nothing of how King Hussein ignored our advice  passed on to him by General Odd Bull of the United Nations  when he joined in the attack on Israel with the forces of Egypt and Syria.173.	We did not plan to go to war. We fought to defend ourselves from the grim fate promised us.174.	We cannot overlook the fact that the simplistic solution  which has been advocated by so many participants in this debate  was a reality on the ground from 1949 to 1967. It brought us war.175.	In 1973  Syria and Egypt again launched a war against Israel. After their defeat  the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East was set up in the framework of which two disengagement agreements were reached with Egypt and Syria in 1974  and an interim agreement was made with Egypt in 1975.176.	Since then  Israel has not ceased to indicate its readiness to resume the peace negotiations at Geneva on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).177.	In view of the many inaccurate constructions that have been put on resolution 242(1967)  let us be quite clear what that resolution does say and what it does not say. It does not require Israel to withdraw unilaterally from the territories it occupied in 1967. It does not call upon Israel to leave all those territories. It does not make peace negotiations contingent upon such withdrawal. It does not fix boundaries. What it does require is negotiations between the parties to arrive at an agreed peace treaty.178.	The wording of the resolution makes it perfectly clear that new boundaries are to be determined between the States of the region. The statement that ""secure and recognized boundaries"" must be negotiated implies that previous boundaries were not secure or recognized. The fact that new boundaries are to be reached can also be inferred from the fact that Arab and Soviet pressure for the inclusion of a reference to ""withdrawal from all the territories"" was unsuccessful.179.	I quote Mr. Joseph Sisco  who was the United States Assistant Secretary of State for International OrganizationAffairs at the time that resolution 242 (1967) was adopted. He said:""That resolution did not say 'withdrawal to the pre-June 5 lines'. That resolution said that the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words  the question of the final borders ... is a matter of negotiations between the parties.""This is still our position. We have to establish new boundaries  and not to return to the old ones. We have to negotiate permanent boundaries that will afford Israel security.180.	According to resolution 242 (1967)  the peace settlement must include:""Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area . .."".The settlement is therefore to be reached between States  and not to involve the participation of any organization whatsoever.181.	Resolution 242 (1967) makes no mention whatsoever of the PLO. The PLO is a terrorist organization whose record is one of deliberate and indiscriminate atrocities against innocent civilians  including women and children. The PLO is governed by the Palestinian National Covenant of 1964  as amended in 1968 and reconfirmed as recently as in March of this year by the Palestinian National Council in Cairo.182.	Article 6 of this Covenant calls for the expulsion of the vast majority of the Jewish population from our country. In article 15  it calls for the elimination of Zionism. In article 19  it calls in effect for the destruction of the State of Israel. In article 20  it makes the preposterous assertion that ""the claim of historical or spiritual links between the Jews and Palestine is [not] in conformity with historical fact..."". In article 21  it declares that ""all alternatives to the total liberation of Palestine"" are rejected-that is  any plan that falls short of the destruction of Israel.183.	There is not a sovereign State in this Organization that would negotiate with a body calling for its destruction.184.	Many delegations have proposed the establishment of a Palestinian State governed by the PLO on the West Bank and in Gaza. Again  this is but a futile exercise in wishful thinking  totally unacceptable to us  ignoring  as it does  the language of resolution 242 (1967) and the basic facts on the ground.185.	A PLO mini-State on the West Bank  which could not be viable in itself  would be a base for attempts to destroy Israel. One has only to consult a map and the political programme of the PLO to realize this.186.	The provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) were accepted by Israel as the basis of negotiation towards peace. We accepted Council resolution 242 (1967). We did not accept an amended Council resolution 242 (1967)-even if such an amendment were feasible  which it is not  Council resolution 242 (1967) derives its strength and authority from the fact that it has been accepted by the States parties to the conflict.187.	Moreover  the United States regards resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) as the exclusive basis for a settlement of the conflict. The memorandum of agreement between Israel and the United States on the Geneva Peace Conference  signed on I September 1975  declares in article 4 that the United States""... will oppose and if necessary vote against any initiatives in the Security Council to alter adversely the terms of reference of the Geneva Peace Conference  or to change resolutions 242 and 338 in ways which are incompatible with their original purpose"".This position was reaffirmed by the United States only a few days ago in a joint statement with Israel.188.	Israel is ready to resume negotiations at Geneva for the achievement of true  contractual and effective peace treaties  including the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the Arab States. There can be no participation of any additional State  group or organization at the Geneva Peace Conference without the agreement of all the initial participants. All negotiations should be conducted on a bilateral basis.189.	Through the good offices- of the United States  we have conveyed suggestions on the substantive  and not merely on the procedural  issues.190.	First  we have provided a draft text of a full peace treaty in all its aspects. Secondly  we have supplied details of our approach in respect of discussion and negotiation on the various issues. This part is in turn made up of two elements: first  a presentation of some of the main questions involved in a peace agreement between ourselves and each of our neighbours  questions such as Israel's security  guarantees of freedom of navigation in all international waterways  the security of the Jordan River sources in the north  a basis for coexistence with the Palestinian Arabs in the"" Gaza Strip  Judaea and Samaria  and other relevant topics—in other words  the questions which we believe we must contend with if we are to sign a final peace agreement between ourselves and each of the neighbouring Arab States. The second element comprises our ideas for resolving these questions. In our view  there should be complete normalization of relations  including diplomatic relations  trade and cultural ties. We have suggested modalities  including demilitarized zones and other arrangements.191.	In addition  there remains the cardinal principle that the negotiations should be conducted without prior conditions or commitments. This principle means not only that neither side obligates the other to agree in advance to any condition whatsoever but also that all issues and areas areopen to negotiation. We for our part will be completely open and sincere in listening to  discussing and examining the proposals of the other parties. To illustrate this: we believe that the settlement concerning Judaea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip should be based on our living together with the Palestinian Arabs in those areas  and not on a partition of the territory.192.	For 10 years  between 1967 and 1977  the Government of Israel was committed to territorial concessions in return for genuine peace  and this implied the redivision of the area. But to no avail.193.	Now our view is that redivision is not the answer. Nowhere is it possible to draw a dividing line which will satisfy not only the security  but also the historical  economic and social needs of all sides. Bethlehem  a satellite town of Jerusalem and dependent on Jerusalem for its tourist trade and indeed its very existence  cannot be cut off from the holy city. Mount Scopus  the site of the Hebrew University and the Hadassah Hospital  cannot be separated from Israel. And are the Arabs in Gaza once again to be bottled up in an intolerably narrow strip of land  unable to get out without passing an international frontier? No. The model for the future must be united Jerusalem  where since 1967 Jews and Arabs have proved that they can live together harmoniously to their joint benefit  where all residents enjoy freedom of movement in all parts of the holy city and where freedom of access to the Holy Places is assured for all. There is no room—and no need—for barbed wire any more.194.	But  for all that  had the Arabs proposed partitioning those territories between ourselves and them  we would have discussed and examined their proposal and afterwards would have decided whether we were ready to agree to it or not. In this connexion I should like to point out that we have re-examined the positions of Jordan and of the Palestinian Arabs and we have found no inclination on the part of either for a solution based on the redivision of Judaea  Samaria and the Gaza Strip.- 195. The criticism which has been directed against Israel in respect of the establishment of settlements in Judaea and Samaria is unfounded. The settlements are legal. Under international law neither Jordan nor any other Arab State has any sovereign territorial rights in the West Bank or in any other part of what was mandatory Palestine in 1948 when the United Kingdom surrendered its Mandate. No State today has any claim of sovereignty to what was mandatory Palestine that is better than or even equal to Israel's claims.196.	The Arab States rejected the United Nations partition resolution and  in violation of the United Nations Charter  they used force in an attempt to prevent its implementation. The Arab use of force in 1948 was an act of aggression-not of self-defence.197.	""... an armed struggle is taking place in Palestine as a result of the unlawful invasion by a number of States of the territory of Palestine  which does not form part of the territory of any of the States whose armed forces have invaded it.""That is what Mr. Tarasenko of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic said in the Security Council in 1948.198.	No rights accrued to any of the Arab States from that act  and those States were in fact subject to the restrictions that international law imposes on a ""conquering"" and ""occupying"" army.199.	Jordan's annexation of Judaea and Samaria early in 1950 was never recognized by any State other than Pakistan and the United Kingdom. The United States Department of State  at a press conference on 29 July 1977  confirmed that there were legal problems over the sovereign rights of Jordan in the West Bank.200.	In view of this illegal annexation of the West Bank  the fourth Geneva Convention is not applicable.201.	But even if the laws of belligerent occupation were applicable  those rules contain no restrictions on the freedom of persons to take up residence in the area involved. The fourth Geneva Convention bans forcible transfers  not voluntary acts of individuals taking up residence in the area of the West Bank. Mo Arab inhabitants have been displaced by the establishment of these Jewish settlements. Not a single Arab resident of Judaea and Samaria has been made homeless as a result of the establishment of those peaceful villages. And  above all  it is unacceptable to us that Jews should be prohibited from living in any part of their ancestral land.202.	Let me make one point clear: the settlements will not decide the final borders between Israel and its neighbours. The borders will be decided upon in the negotiations between Israel and its neighbours. The settlements are by no means an obstacle to peace because  if they were  we should have had peace years ago.203.	We believe that the problem concerning the status of the Arabs living in the West Bank should be settled in the framework of peace negotiations in Geneva between us and the Jordanian delegation  which may include Palestinian Arabs from Judaea and Samaria.204.	One of the central problems that has to be solved in a peace settlement is the problem of the refugees. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) refers to ""refugees""  not ""Arab refugees"": it covers both Jewish and Arab refugees. When the resolution was being drafted  a Soviet attempt to restrict it to Arab refugees failed.205.	The origin of the Palestinian Arab refugee problem was the Arab rejection of the United Nations partition resolution and the war which the Arab States declared against the State of Israel one day after its establishment. The responsibility is therefore theirs. Had the Arabs accepted the resolution  there would have been no refugee problem. Furthermore  because of the wars conducted by the Arab States against Israel  Jews who had lived for thousands of years in Arab lands were forced to leave  abandoning all their property and possessions. For about 590 000 Arab refugees there were about 600 000 Jewish refugees from Iraq  Yemen  Syria  Egypt  Libya and the rest of North Africa.   206.	Refugees in other parts of the world have been successfully integrated into the national community to which they belong. The only exception to the general rule is the situation of the Arab refugees. The Arab States have refused to absorb and integrate their brothers into their respective societies. The Arab States have made the ""restoration"" of the ""legitimate rights"" of those refugees- namely  their return to Israel—the central demand. That demand constitutes a serious distortion of the realities of the refugee problem.207.	We do not intend to send back Jews to Iraq  Syria  Egypt  Morocco  Yemen and other Arab countries  to be hanged in the public squares of Baghdad and to be deprived of their human rights and to become third-class citizens  imprisoned in ghettoes  as in Syria now  in order to take Arab refugees in their place. The fact is that an exchange of population has taken place between Israel and the Arab countries.208.	The difference between Israel and the Arab States is that  while we in Israel from the outset integrated all the Jewish refugees into our society  the Arab States deliberately perpetuated the ""refugee status"" of their own brethren in order to use them as a political weapon against Israel. The Arab demand for the return of the refugees to Israel  coupled with proposals for the establishment of a Palestinian State  is calculated to bring about the destruction of Israel. The refugees should be resettled and integrated into the Arab societies in which they now live. In any peace settlement specific provisions should be made to enable all refugees to find accommodation  employment and adequate compensation.209.	In any discussion of reparations for the refugees  Israel will raise the question of reparations for Jewish refugees from Arab lands and insist that all their claims be settled within the framework of the peace agreement.210.	There is only one road along which it is possible to move towards peace; that is the road of direct negotiations with no pre-conditions. No conflict in the world has ever been resolved without the parties to the conflict negotiating face to face. Our conflict is not different.211.	The heart of the problem is the Arab refusal to recognize the right of Israel to national sovereignty in the ancient  historical land of the Jewish people. That is the heart of the problem  and until it is overcome the obstacles to a just and durable peace will remain.212.	The developments of recent days and the possibility of a resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  none the less  give room for guarded optimism which could turn into grounds for great hope. For our part  we are prepared to embark on a common effort  long and challenging as it may be  to negotiate a final agreement to live in peace and security. "
"65",3467,"ITA",32,1977,"﻿79.	 Mr. President  allow me  first of all  to join the previous speakers in conveying to you my warmest congratulations and best wishes and to associate myself whole-heartedly with the expressions of appreciation which have been voiced for the outstanding work of your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  and for the work that the Secretary-General has accomplished with his usual efficiency. To you  Mr. President  I wish to convey my feelings of complete confidence  bearing in mind the closeness of the ties which unite our two countries and the special contribution which the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has made to the strengthening of peace and to the development of international co-operation in Europe and throughout the world.80.	This year  in particular  a significant event has occurred in the history of our two countries which provides a confirmation of the possibility of resolving controversies in a way both new and just. I am referring to the ratification by our respective national parliaments of the Agreements signed at Osimo in 1975. With the entry into force of these important agreements-and not without a grave sacrifice  which  however  it accepted with the conscience of the perspective it opened-Italy has put an end to a period of uncertainty and strain in its relations with the neighbouring and friendly people of Yugoslavia  and the foundations were thus laid for increasing fruitful co-operation between the two countries. This was an important event  not only for the parties directly concerned but also  I believe  for all those members of the international community which may find themselves confronted by similar situations. In accordance with the principles on which Italy bases the conduct of its foreign policy  we followed in this instance the method of the peaceful settlement of disputes  which consists in systematically and patiently searching for points of convergence and opportunities for co-operation. Italy therefore feels entitled to propose this method to the Assembly again at a time when new tensions and new conflicts are being added to those inherited from the past and threats to the peace of peoples become more serious  making the task of peace-keeping even more burdensome for the United Nations.81.	With this session of the General Assembly  the great family of the United Nations also includes the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti.82.	May I be allowed to associate myself whole-heartedly with those who have addressed words of welcome and good wishes to these new Members and to their delegations here present.83.	Italy already enjoys relations of friendship and cooperation with these States and proposes to amplify and develop them in the common interest.84.	The United Nations has thus taken a further step  which we consider to be particularly significant  towards the goal of universality  which we believe is essential for the effective discharge of its functions and for the strengthening of its role and authority.85.	In this respect  we welcome and fully approve of the report on the work of the Organization presented to the General Assembly at this session by Secretary- General Waldheim. In particular  we share the basic idea underlying the whole report  namely  his appeal to all Member States to harmonize their respective national interests in all sectors-political  military  social and administrative-with the long-term interests of the whole international community.86.	Since strains and dangers on the international level originate not only from tensions between States but also from disputes and conflicts within States  between individuals  groups and their institutions  it is particularly urgent that greater efforts be made to enable the United Nations to play a larger role in the protection of human rights. We are therefore interested in any proposal and any useful initiative in this field  and we pledge our full support for the proposal to appoint a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  while we also feel that the procedures envisaged in Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 should be strengthened.87.	Italy is convinced that the individual person should be the focal-point of any institution which the international community seeks or proposes to set up  and that the dignity and the freedom of the individual person must represent the foundation  the reference point and the final aim of any system of guarantees between States. The United Nations must be able to respond in adequate terms to this appeal  inherent in contemporary history  and to this mission. This is the dramatic demand arising from a way of thinking that is becoming increasingly rooted and widespread in the world conscience and which  because of its growing intensity  can no longer be classified as a mere humanitarian reflex. To recognize it and to recognize its political nature is an act of realism  even though the differences of opinion as to the best means of satisfying it remain great.88.	From the respect for and adherence to this mission  the United Nations can derive the impetus to act in a way that must be all the more incisive because the main problems afflicting mankind are becoming more acute and remain unsolved.89.	In this respect  I wish to refer to the views expressed on Monday in this forum by the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs in his capacity as the current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community.90.	Italy is particularly aware that the continuation of the present deadlock in the Middle East has grave implications both for the security of the region and for international peace itself. We are especially aware of the urgent need to make a determined effort to reactivate  with the involved participation of all the interested parties  effective peace negotiations within the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. In order for that to be possible  all the parties must make the maximum effort to summon up a firm resolve and a new determination to overcome distrust and renounce mutual preclusions.91.	Italy is deeply aware of the need for a prompt resumption of the peace negotiations  and has therefore reiterated on numerous occasions its readiness to contribute to the search for solutions and to the stage of implementation  namely  through participation in a system of international guarantees within the framework of the United Nations. In the context of a global arrangement  theArab side will have to be ready to accept the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized frontiers  just as Israel must be willing to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people.92.	We consider that the participation of the representatives of all the countries directly concerned  including the representatives of the Palestinian people  must be ensured in the peace negotiations in an appropriate manner  to be worked out in consultation among all the parties concerned.93.	On several occasions Italy has stated the principles on which  in its view  the action aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace settlement must be based. As for the substance of the problem  they call for: the necessity of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all the territories occupied in June 1967 and refraining from all the measures-and I refer to the new ones as well as the old—which consolidate the fait accompli of the occupation  and therefore represent a course of action directly opposed to the desirable one: respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all the States of the region within secure  recognized and internationally guaranteed frontiers; concrete recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people  who cannot be denied a fatherland  to express their own national identity  also through the constitution of a State entity.94.	With great anxiety we also observe the other signs of conflict and distrust that darken the Middle East horizon and retard the prospect of a settlement. I refer in particular to the continuation of tension in southern Lebanon  a possible source of uncontrollable events. I should like to express the hope for the prompt cessation of the threats which still menace the unity  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and which impede the process of national reconstruction resolutely undertaken by the Lebanese Government on the basis of the inter-Arab agreements of autumn 1976.95.	In Cyprus  too  there still exists a serious situation of painful confrontation We are convinced that a satisfactory settlement of the Cyprus dispute must be based on the objective of safeguarding the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the country This can emerge only from a direct dialogue between the parties concerned and from the will to reconcile the divergent community needs in the higher interests of all Cypriots. We therefore continue to address to both parties the warmest appeal to explore together the path of dialogue and compromise.96.	It is not only in the eastern Mediterranean that signs of tension  uncertainty and conflict persist; unfortunately we also find them  to an increasing extent  in the African continent  where they also provide opportunities for external interference and for artificial confrontations  both ideological and political  among the countries of the continent themselves  at the expense of their priority requirements of development and co-operation.97.	In the Horn of Africa we are following with deep concern the heightening of tensions and  regrettably  of conflicts which are bringing grave sufferings to those friendly peoples and which run the risk of altering thedelicate equilibriums of an area of vital importance for international peace and co-operation.98.	The positive solution of the question of Djibouti  which has attained independence peacefully and whose accession to the international community we welcome  has not yet been followed by appropriate negotiations for the solution of the other delicate problems of the region.99.	Given the situation that has arisen between Ethiopia and Somalia  the most urgent and essential objective is that the two countries should find the way to reduce tension and to bring about the conditions for a constructive dialogue. To these two African countries  with which we are bound by profound ties of friendship and co-operation  we therefore address a warm appeal for peace from this prestigious forum of the United Nations General Assembly.100.	The international community must do its utmost to encourage the initiatives that are being carried out within the framework of the principles and purposes of the Organization of African Unity in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The search for more stable and peaceful arrangements in the area  if they are to permit forms of fruitful co-operation among all the countries of the Horn of Africa  must be pursued through negotiations mindful of the aspirations of their people.101.	We are also convinced that  in order to prevent the extension and exacerbation of the conflicts in Africa  we must stamp out as rapidly as possible the remaining vestiges of the colonial past and firmly oppose racist policies. The strategy which has recently been worked out in various international forums and which has found its most advanced formulations in the declarations of Lagos and of Maputo must be implemented through firm and co-ordinated action on the political and economic levels with the purpose of pressing for just and realistic negotiated solutions. In firmly and whole-heartedly supporting this line of action  we hope that it may be implemented by interventions designed to avoid bloody clashes between the forces that are most directly confronting each other.102.	In the case of Southern Rhodesia  Italy supports the plan recently worked out by the United Kingdom with the support of the United States. Italy considers this plan as a comprehensive attempt to ensure a rapid  effective and ordered transfer of all powers to the peoples of Zimbabwe.103.	For Namibia  the negotiating process initiated by the contact group of the five members of the Security Council provides the parties most directly concerned with a most valuable opportunity to ensure the exercise by the Namibian people of their right to self-determination and independence and to the exercise of their sovereignty.104.	Here I should like to pay a tribute to the spirit of sacrifice and to the moral determination of those who in South Africa have decided to endorse the values of democracy  civil liberties and human dignity. Among them are men of all colours and creeds. Some of them have fallen along the difficult road they had chosen  and for all of them I wish to pay a tribute to the memory of Steven Biko  who just before his death was appealing for a non-racial society which would be just and equal for all and in which colour  creed and race would not be reasons for division or hatred.105.	For the international community  the persistence of apartheid in South Africa poses problems  a valid response to which must be commensurate with the growing opposition of the majority of the South African population to a regime which is guilty of the most extreme examples of racial discrimination and violations of human rights. This response can only consist in the creation of a society open to contributions from all its ethnic members and to participation of all its citizens on the basis of equality.106.	On the other hand  the news from other continents is more positive. In this connexion  I should like to recall my visit last June to the People's Republic of China  which further contributed to the strengthening of fruitful ties and co-operation between the two countries. Events of great importance for the international community have taken place this year in Asia. After the crises of previous years  that continent can today rediscover in a framework of greater detente and stability in inter-State relations a climate that favours the development among its countries of forms of closer collaboration which will pave the way for peace and economic development. We hope that such forms of co-operation may become deeper and more constructive in the years to come and that the causes of tension and crises that still exist in the area can be removed in a spirit of justice and fairness.107.	Also  in inter-American relations certain developments encourage dialogue and understanding. Both the approval of the documents presented to the June Assembly of the Organization of American States and the recent signature in Washington of the agreements between Panama and the United States constitute proof of the will of the parties concerned to follow the path of negotiation and reconciliation of their respective claims. The presence at the signing of those agreements of the Heads of State from North and South America appears to us  moreover  to confer on those agreements and on the method followed in achieving  them a significance which goes beyond their specific legislative content and which underlines the general spirit of Pan-American co-operation and solidarity.108.	The United Nations has a unique and irreplaceable role to play in tackling such problems as development and economic co-operation.109.	The situation of the world economy continues to present disturbing features. We are indeed confronted by the persistence of marked imbalances in the international economic system  which  far from developing in accordance with expectations  has witnessed inter alia the continuation of serious inequalities between industrialized countries and developing countries and also inequalities within both categories of countries.110.	The basic inadequacy of the strategies so far proposed to confront the serious problems of developmentmay be attributed certainly to the objective conditions of the present international economic situation  but also to the difficulties of perceiving the peculiar structural differences in the situations of the individual developing countries and of applying specific remedies to them.111.	Those considerations underline the need for a renewed effort to achieve more and better results in the field of economic co-operation  establishing moreover an order of priority in the use of available resources. Italy is firmly convinced that the time has come to establish a new international economic order which would allow all States to follow the path of development most suited to their requirements and traditions and to play a more important role in the international decision-making processes. This goal will be successfully attained if we prove able to begin to solve existing problems  especially those concerning raw materials  trade  the transfer of technology and indebtedness  which are crucial for both developing and developed countries.112.	The achievement of the new international economic order must be based on a concept of development to be assessed not only in quantitative terms but also  and above all  in terms of the social components which are to be closely connected with it. I am referring to the need to seek higher levels of nutrition  health care  education and housing  as well as adequate employment opportunities and an equitable distribution of wealth.113.	The international community must base its own programme and action on the establishment of the prerequisites and material conditions which will allow the primary requirements of life to be met in all parts of the world. The objective of our co-operation efforts must be the gradual elimination of those obstacles which  in many parts of the globe  still impede the satisfaction of needs which constitute the basis of any other kind of concern which may be expressed about the dignity and fulfilment of the human person.114.	For those reasons Italy  too  is committed  whether bilaterally or multilaterally  to facilitating the economic and social development of the developing countries.115.	Moreover  the recognition that destabilizing factors exist in the international economic system and that we still have not solved many problems which characterize relations between the industrialized world and the developing countries necessarily lead us to emphasize the interdependence of the various economies and the growing awareness of the indivisibility of prosperity and progress.116.	I should like at this point to comment on the results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. Undoubtedly those results have fallen short of expectations  even though the desire to continue the dialogue has been reiterated. The discussion of one point -for example  energy-was clearly inconclusive  since it was not even possible to agree on a forum for its continuation.117.	On both the national and international levels  Italy is applying and promoting specific energy-saving measures and hopes that those countries whose energy consumption is relatively high will also increase their efforts to facilitate access to energy sources by those countries which most need them for their development.118.	The reduction of consumption will have only relative significance  however  unless it is accompanied by a decisive effort of diversification based on nuclear energy suitably integrated  where possible  with the exploitation of other renewable sources. In this regard  Italy has noted with concern that in many countries programmes seem to be slowing down and that at the international level difficulties have been encountered in working out forms of co-operation for the peaceful development of nuclear energy.119.	We must make a joint effort to solve existing problems so as to allow mankind to count on this irreplaceable resource  with due respect for environmental requirements and non-proliferation. The prospects for energy consumption in the coming years do not  in our opinion  permit delays and indecision.120.	In this respect  the Italian Government considers that we must follow the path of dialogue and work out practical forms of co-operation in order to achieve a positive solution of these problems  which are so closely bound up with the needs which must be faced by numerous developing countries deprived  like Italy  of natural resources in this sector.121.	For this purpose too  the Italian Government considers favourably the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of an energy institute within the United Nations system.122.	Ours is a foreign policy of peace  solidarity and co-operation which  in conformity with precise national requirements and on the basis of a broad parliamentary convergence  continues to develop within three separate but interdependent frameworks: the European Community  the Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations.123.	Italy is resolutely committed  with all its resources  to the building of a united Europe. For us. the election by direct universal suffrage of the European Parliament represents a highly significant moment in a democratic process aimed at achieving a more advanced step of political  economic and social integration. Moreover  since procedures under way for the admission to the European: community of Greece  Portugal and Spain. while confirming the solidarity of -the European community in the democratic choice which those countries have made. will also enlarge the external projection of the community itself.124.	Indeed  the European Community has already demonstrated its desire to be not an egoistic and autarchic body defending positions of privilege  but a body which  instead  is open  in the largest possible way  to all forms of useful co-operation.125.	The second major reference point for Italy is the Atlantic Alliance  in which it participates with the un-shakeable conviction that this Alliance still plays a decisive role in the maintenance of an equilibrium essential for safeguarding peace and developing a constructive dialogueThe third and largest sphere of external activity in which Italy participates is the universal sphere of the United Nations  which we feel is the most appropriate forum for dialogue  negotiation and meeting with all the countries of the world  and particularly the developing countries.126.	The traditional support of my Government for the principle of the universality of the United Nations includes all the specialized agencies  which  together with the United Nations  constitute a unique and irreplaceable system of international co-operation.127.	We cannot  therefore  but express our concern at the intentions expressed in the United States to leave the oldest of the United Nations specialized agencies  the 1LO  which today still plays an important role in the elaboration of international norms and policies in the labour field. We are confident that the United States  overcoming its otherwise understandable motives for dissatisfaction  can continue to make its contribution to the ILO so as to keep its original characteristics and operating efficiency128.	Italy also whole-heartedly supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve disarmament.129.	Besides the moral judgment that we must express as we face the serious diversion of resources which  in the final reckoning  results from any arms race  and beyond any criticism we are bound to make of the tendency to pile up weapons of death and destruction  I believe that we must say aloud how mistaken it is to seek stability through military balances  in a continuous progression  when this could be achieved and defended at levels much less onerous for everybody. To defend the security of States and to prevent their peoples from sacrificing an excessive and ever-increasing share of the fruits of their labours  the only solution is the gradual  balanced reduction of existing military deterrents.130.	To follow the path of arms limitation  moreover  means not only meeting the needs of life and development  which are immediate and urgent  but also promoting that relaxation of tension among States which may help to bring about  without necessarily indulging in Utopian hopes  concerted dialogue on the subject of general disarmament. With a view to a similar effort  the special session of the General Assembly next May represents a most valuable opportunity for the international community  and Italy  which  together with other countries  sponsored the initiative at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  is constructively and actively working  especially in the Preparatory Committee  for its implementation and success.131.	The preparation of a programme of general and complete disarmament also involves the establishment of certain priorities in a harmonious and balanced framework. Italy considers that these priorities must include both the search for significant measures of nuclear disarmament and efforts to make progress along the path leading to conventional disarmament  and in particular to the prohibition of chemical weapons. We therefore attach vital importance to the current negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States for a limitation of nuclear weapons  and we hope that they will be accompanied by further progress towards specific reduction in existing atomic arsenals  as provided for in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This Treaty is a highly important instrument also for achieving increased international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  and we hope that all those States which have not yet signed it will be able to do so.132.	In order to encourage a balanced limitation of armaments  we must intensify arid extend throughout the world the process of detente which in Europe was initiated some years ago and which in Belgrade is now about to receive its first verification.133.	In this respect  I wish to point out that the Italian Government has always thought that the Belgrade meeting should tackle concretely and constructively the task entrusted to it by the Final Act of Helsinki to promote  without prejudice to a coherent development of detente  a renewed effort to implement all the provisions of the Final Act by the 35 signatory States. This view is reflected in the final document issued by the Preparatory Meeting  and there is every reason to hope that the debate about to take place in the Yugoslav capital will develop in accord with expectations.134.	In order to ensure that detente is further consolidated and becomes an irreversible process in Europe  we think that we should all increase our efforts to promote that freer circulation of men  ideas and experience which will allow us to understand ever more clearly how the interests and the aspirations of peoples have a common denominator.135.	Mr. President  allow me to conclude by saying that I am certain that  under your highly respected leadership  the work of this thirty-second session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and will be able to respond to the expectations of the international community. I can assure you that the Italian delegation will do its utmost to help you achieve this goal.  "
"66",3513,"JAM",32,1977,"﻿251.	 On behalf of my delegation  I should like to express our warmest congratulations to Mr. Mojsov on his election to the Presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is a fitting recognition of his outstanding qualities of leadership and enlightened grasp of international issues. It is a tribute to his country's distinguished record in world affairs as a founding member of the non-aligned movement. We feel confident that under his capable guidance this General Assembly will inspire a new momentum for international co-operation towards peace and economic justice for all peoples.252.	I also wish to pay a tribute to his predecessor and express our sincere appreciation to Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka for his outstanding performance in presiding over the deliberations of the last session.253.	To Secretary-General Waldheim I express gratitude for his untiring efforts in the cause of peace and the solution of the critical issues which face us all.254.	I should like also to welcome the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as Members of the United Nations. The admission of Djibouti marks another important milestone in the process of decolonization.255.	As regards the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  we have watched with awe and admiration the unceasing struggle of these people for three decades against imperialism in the fight for independence. And  that war having been won  we witnessed yet another struggle-this one for membership in the United Nations. Viet Nam's history of struggle for independence and the fight to take its rightful place among the community of free nations stand as a shining example of determination to all oppressed peoples.256.	We are sure that members of the international community will render to both these countries assistance for their development and reconstruction consonant with the fullest respect for their sovereignty.257.	The year 1977 was ushered in with expressions of optimism by some leading statesmen that substantial progress would be made towards the solution of areas of international tension and conflict  both political and economic.258.	The current political international situation is a source of grave concern to us all. New areas of strife and tension have surfaced which present a critical challenge to the preservation of international peace and security. In addition  the continued existence of major international economic problems  particularly those affecting the developing countries  and the lack of significant progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order  are rapidly dispelling any sense of optimism. Urgent solutions must be applied if the United Nations is to fulfil its responsibilities as an effective instrument for preserving peace.259.	The situation in southern Africa has become more critical. The people of Zimbabwe are no closer to freedom and independence and  as time drags on  the only losers are the indigenous people of Zimbabwe themselves. The problem must be settled within the guidelines set out in the various United Nations declarations and resolutions  and especially the Maputo Declaration  adopted earlier this year.260.	We must continue to demand of the illegal Smith regime the immediate and unconditional accession to power by the majority  of the people of the Territory. On this  there can be no compromise  and any attempt to bring about any other solution is bound in advance to fail. We view with interest current initiatives to resolve the situation. The Government and people of Jamaica will always support attempts to bring about a negotiated settlement  but the armed struggle will continue  and it will receive our unqualified support until the legitimate aspirations of the indigenous people are met.261.	In Namibia we find the Pretoria regime still engaged against world opinion and  in defiance of the injunctions of the United Nations  in the illegal occupation of territory which is the direct responsibility of this body. As such  this constitutes a clear and most direct challenge to the authority of the United Nations. That regime has flouted the authority of the United Nations  has shown repeatedly that it does not intend to withdraw its presence and influence from the Territory  has established nuclear-test installations in the desert region of Namibia and has carried out preparations to test a nuclear device for military and aggressive purposes. Now what do we find? Negotiations are at present being conducted by certain Governments with the Pretoria regime in an effort to plead with  beg and beseech that Government to give up that which it illegally occupies. 262.	My delegation stands firmly behind the Maputo Declaration. It is up to the people of Namibia to determine their own future. Free elections must be held under the supervision and control of the United Nations. Prior to such elections  conditions for a negotiated settlement must be created in accordance with all the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  particularly as they relate to the removal of South African military presence from the Territory  the participation of the South West Africa People's Organization in the elections  and acceptance of the fact that Namibia will proceed to independence as one political entity  with its territorial integrity preserved. Any negotiated settlement must include these basic conditions to command Jamaica's support and endorsement.263.	The situation in South Africa itself is now at a critical stage: massacres of innocent blacks and the murder of individual black leaders continue to be the order of the day as the white racist minority increases its acts of repression to delay the inevitable holocaust. And while leaders and opinion-makers in some of the major Powers exhort the oppressed  blacks to seek change by peaceful means  Vorster has shown his manifest contempt for such exhortations  as well as for the overtures that have been made to him by some of the major Powers  by recently announcing bogus proposals for constitutional change which make no provision for transferring power to the majority of the peoples of South Africa.264.	Action to support the African struggle for freedom is now a matter of urgency. Of particular concern is the continuing collaboration of some major Powers with the Pretoria regime in the military and economic fields. We can no longer be content with hollow assurances of opposition to apartheid while these countries profit from their military and economic deals and thereby enable the reinforcementof this criminal policy of apartheid. In this regard  the most disturbing development is the acquisition by the Pretoria regime of the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons.265.	The World Conference for Action against Apartheid held in Lagos  Nigeria  in August of this year once again demonstrated international abhorrence of the system of apartheid. But the call of the Lagos Conference is for action to support the struggle of the African people to secure their legitimate rights and for action to sever all contacts with South Africa.266.	In this latter regard  we hope that this Assembly will take concrete action towards the finalization of an international convention against apartheid in sports  as called for in the resolution which was adopted by the Assembly last year.267.	The hopes and expectations of the international community at the beginning of 1977 that the year would show meaningful progress towards a peaceful settlement of the problem of the Middle East have been seriously prejudiced by recent developments in the occupied Arab territories The recognition by the Government of Israel of settlements by its nationals in the occupied territories is tantamount to annexation  and reinforces the view held by many States that Israel's basic policy in the Middle East is one of territorial expansion. The acquisition of territory by force is totally unacceptable to my Government. Jamaica continues to regard the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) as the basic ingredient for a settlement in the Middle East. We regard the participation of the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people as an indispensable prerequisite for the successful resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.268.	We are encouraged by recent evidence of a more even-handed policy towards the Middle East problem by one of the major Powers-a policy which includes recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. More than ever  it is essential that all parties to the conflict show restraint in their actions and give mutual recognition to one another  including the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and the existence of an Israeli State  lest the momentum towards the resumption of the Peace Conference be lost and the world find itself plunged once more into a deepening international crisis.269.	The situation in Cyprus is another long-standing problem  as that small independent and non-aligned country remains dismembered through occupation by foreign military forces. The United Nations must therefore renew its efforts to promote a solution which is in the interests of the people of Cyprus through an early resumption of meaningful talks between the two communities and the withdrawal of the foreign troops.270.	Perhaps the most positive achievement over the past year is the successful outcome of negotiations on new Panama Canal treaties which satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Government and people of Panama. The settlement of this long-standing issue augurs well for the future of relations in our hemisphere  and we sincerely hope that this new spirit of understanding and co-operation will lead to the solution of the other outstanding issues in other parts of the world as well.271.	In particular  within the hemisphere we look forward to a prompt solution to the Belize issue. For far too long the people of Belize have been prevented from achieving their legitimate rights. Talks held earlier this year have not provided any meaningful results for the achievement of the independence and security of Belize. At the same time there is fearful evidence that certain countries have been supplying arms for use against Belize. Moreover  the events which followed the movement of troops against Belize earlier this year leave no doubt that the situation is a growing threat to international peace.272.	In the circumstances my Government wishes to re-emphasize that the United Nations must act now to provide appropriate international safeguards for the independence of Belize  with preservation of its territorial integrity. If the United Nations cannot help to ensure the right to independence of a small  defenceless country by providing such safeguards  then it will have fallen far short of fulfilling its responsibilities to the international community.271 The relaxation of tension in the world and the promotion of international peace and security are directly related to substantive progress in disarmament. We continue to witness the escalation of the arms race  which has already reached alarming proportions. New and sophisticated weapons of mass destruction are being developed to add to already heavily-stocked arsenals. As the proliferation of nuclear weapons continues tensions increase and the danger of a nuclear holocaust becomes more frightening. No progress has been made over the past year on the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and other issues of high priority in the field of disarmament.273.	We urge the major Powers to commit themselves to more active endeavours towards the goal of general and complete disarmament. One step in this direction would be the reduction of military budgets and the use of funds thus saved for international assistance to developing countries. In this context I wish to emphasize that the arms race is inconsistent with the pressing social and economic needs of the developing world. It is deplorable that annual expenditures of over $300 billion are being wastefully utilized on tools of destruction.274.	But we should not abandon hope. The special session on disarmament scheduled for 1978 presents an opportunity for new approaches to this question. My Government looks forward to an intensive session which should provide a new impetus for progress towards general and complete disarmament under effective international control.275.	The question of human rights is fundamental to all of our concerns and underlies all our efforts to resolve the most pressing issues now before the General Assembly  whether they be political or economic  or are labeled humanitarian issues. For essentially it is the basic ideals and goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which guide our considerations as we search for justice and peace throughout the world.276.	Let us never forget that current discussions of human rights  both inside and outside +he United Nations  take place at a time of mounting crisis in southern Africa emanating from the most  massive violations of human rights known to our world today.277.	These discussions of human rights raise questions of great sensitivity. This is to a great extent because varying perceptions of human rights exist  with differing emphasis being given to one aspect of human rights as against another. To some nations the civil and political rights of the individual  such as the right of free elections  freedom of expression  freedom of association  are paramount; to some nations the rights of all to food  to shelter  to health  to work  are the most urgent and basic of all human rights. States Members of this Organization strive towards a totality of human satisfaction In developing countries the struggle to achieve that totality becomes one of the most demanding aspects of national endeavours.278.	Developing countries represent that vast section of the world whose previous history of colonization  foreign occupation and control has implied the massive deprivation of the human rights of the majority of our people-our civil  political  social  cultural and economic rights. This has been the experience of my own country.279.	The enormous challenge which confronts us is how now to advance all of these rights for the enjoyment of all citizens without sacrificing one right to the other. Jamaica does not shrink from the magnitude of this task The socialist revolution in which we are engaged is firmly grounded in a democratic respect for the rule of law and the protection of individual human rights and freedom. We shall continue to promote these  not only within our own boundaries but regionally and internationally as well.280.	We record with pleasure that the policies of my Government in the area of legal reform and institution- building will enable large segments of our population  such as women  youth and  particularly  children of unwed parents  to occupy the just and equal position in our society of which they have for centuries been deprived. Our commitment to eradicate poverty commands the highest priority  requiring the mobilization of all our resources  human and natural. Only in this way can we begin to discharge our responsibility to the masses of our people as they exert their rightful claim to enjoy human dignity But the pressure on national resources of fulfilling that responsibility is one of the most crucial challenges which faces the majority of our Member States.281.	Unfortunately  developing countries which take a really serious view of their obligation to divert resources to meet the needs of their underprivileged find little sympathy or understanding among developed countries and certain international institutions. If we devote domestic resources primarily to meeting these needs and have to seek temporary foreign-exchange assistance from the international monetary agencies  those agencies ignore or discount the social objectives and apply rigid and anachronistic yardsticks to the credit application; stigmatize our Governments as having frittered away our resources and provide limited amounts of credit only on condition that the vital social programmes are cut back. All this is done in the name of sound financial practice.282.	As we approach the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it is timely to begin to recall the wide span of human needs identified in that Declaration and the complex nature of the task involved in satisfying those needs  even at the most minimal level. The most complex unresolved aspect of that task to date is the linkage which exists between civil and economic rights.283.	The need for a searching and comprehensive analysis of human rights and the implications of their interdependence and indivisibility are issues which my Government hopes will receive full consideration by this Assembly.284.	Jamaica hopes that we can in the coming weeks address our minds to the capacity of the United Nations to advance human rights on all fronts  guided by the growing recognition that the present urgent search for international economic justice is a process which carries most profound implications for the realization of the full spectrum of human rights for the majority of the world's people.285.	As long as two thirds of mankind continue to exist at a subsistence level  there will be a continuation of crises and tensions throughout the world.286.	The concept of the new international economic order arose from the need to synchronize or integrate international political and economic relations into a single conceptual framework for global development from which benefits would accrue to all countries and all peoples.287.	Since the sixth special session  little progress has been made towards the establishment of the new order. The very acceptance of the concept has been slow as the industrialized market economy countries have clung stubbornly to the past. With a few notable exceptions  leaders and opinion-makers of those countries are doing their peoples a grave disservice by failing to educate them to the need for change in relations between the rich and poor nations. We  the developing countries  will not continue to live in squalor through exploitation by the operations of an. outmoded system of economic relations.288.	The United Nations is the only forum where global problems can be tackled comprehensively with the hope of finding solutions in the interests of the entire international community. In the economic sphere  the results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation clearly show the futility of dealing with these problems on the basis of the participation of a few countries outside the global framework of the United Nations. Yet we must be concerned at the capacity of the United Nations system to deal effectively with the restructuring of the global economic system289.	It is not enough merely to reaffirm that the negotiations on the new international economic order must take place within the United Nations system. We must also take action to ensure that this system is adequately structured to carry out the negotiations and to monitor the implementation of decisions taken and agreements reached.290.	There are three areas which call particularly for new approaches by the United Nations. The first concerns the transfer of resources from developed to developing countries.291.	The two-year period since 1975 should have seen the complete implementation of the decision by the seventh special session of the General Assembly that the flow of concessional financial resources to developing countries should be made  predictable  continuous and increasingly assured. It has been taken up instead with arguments over the definition of official development aid  repetitious explanations of the failure of one or another donor country to maintain the promised level of its voluntary aid  and with attempts to estimate by what decade in the future past targets of voluntary charity will have been reached.292.	It is time now to look at this subject of the transfer of resources in its widest aspects; to keep watch upon the movement of resources on non-concessional as well as concessional terms; to take into account the massive annual growth in the inward flow of resources from the poor to the rich. It is time now also to abandon the annual appeals to halt the downward trend in the volume of charity  to take up once more the various proposals which have been advanced for making the transfer of resources automatic and to negotiate firm commitments in respect of those transfers.293.	Unless my Government can be convinced that existing machinery in the United Nations system can and will immediately be utilized for this new approach to the transfer of resources  we propose to work towards the early introduction of firm proposals for the establishment of a commission on the transfer of resources  in which representatives from developed and developing countries will sit down at a table across from each other and negotiate in earnest about the transfer of resources.294.	The next area which  in the view of my Government  requires a new kind of involvement on the part of the United Nations is that of international monetary reform. For too long now the world monetary system has remained essentially under the control of a few major countries. Detailed technical studies have been made and recommendations for reform of the Bretton Woods system have been put forward; but implementation is being delayed by countries which have the power to place narrow national or group interests above the interests of the world community—with disastrous consequences for the economies of the developing countries. Even those proposals do not fully meet our needs. Moreover  the established principles and practices of IMF in the management of world liquidity will not satisfy the demands of a changing world order.295.	My Government is convinced that the monetary reform eventually carried out will be adequate neither in scope nor in pace if the process of reform remains in the exclusive domain of the present governing bodies of IMF. Some external machinery with sufficient authority to stimulate reform is urgently required.296.	My Government therefore proposes that the General Assembly should decide to establish an ad hoc commission on international monetary reform which would be charged with the function of calling for reports on the measures under consideration in IMF  assessing the progress being made with their implementation and of promoting and guiding the whole process of international monetary reform.297.	The third area in which the United Nations needs to make a new approach concerns energy. Several factors point to the urgency of making effective international arrangements to deal with this critical area.298.	These factors include the need for effective conservation of oil and natural gas; the need to intensify the search for new energy resources; the necessity to ensure that investment choices in the development of alternative energy supplies reflect rational strategies in the developing countries; the need to ensure adequate research into solar  wind and other renewable forms of energy and the need for financial and technical assistance for high-risk investment in energy exploration  in the development of known resources and for diversification programmes.299.	All this must be seen within the context of a precarious world energy supply. In addition  the very close relationship between the question of energy and development must be continually recognized.300.	The studies undertaken by the United Nations at the request of the General Assembly at its seventh special session cannot satisfy the urgency of this need.301.	With respect to financial assistance  international financial institutions  especially the World Bank  should be provided with adequate resources to meet  in particular  the needs of energy-deficient developing countries.302.	My Government therefore proposes that consultations should take place during this session of the General Assembly with a view to establishing one institution to provide for technical co-operation between developed and developing countries in energy exploration  energy diversification and the transfer of energy technology. The consultations will aim at discovering the form and precisely with what functions such a body could be invested.303.	The resumed negotiations on the common fund are scheduled to begin in a few weeks' time and it is imperative that early agreement be reached on the establishment of the fund within the framework of the Integrated Programme for Commodities.304.	Another forthcoming event of major significance is the ministerial meeting of the Trade and Development Board to review measures concerning the debt and related development and financial problems of the least developed  the developing island and the developing land-locked countries. In this connexion  the General Assembly has already charged the forthcoming Ministerial Meeting with the specific task of reaching agreement on concrete measures to provide an immediate solution to the debt problems of developing countries.305.	The progress at those two meetings will be closely watched by developing countries and will constitute the acid text of the  greater understanding  so widely emphasized by developed countries as well as their implicit commitment to negotiate seriously in the United Nations system  particularly on issues involving structural change pertaining to the new international economic order and its establishment. Comprehensive substantive proposals have long been submitted by the Group of 77 on these critical issues  and we look forward to constructive consideration by the developed countries on these important proposals.306.	Another area we regard as being of fundamental importance for the establishment of the new international economic order is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. An international agreement on a convention for the equitable distribution of the resources of the sea-bed is long overdue  and I urge all participants to work seriously towards a successful conclusion of the Conference at its next session  in March 1978. Jamaica looks forward to accommodating the headquarters of the international sea-bed authority.307.	Jamaica has followed with deep interest the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System. It is with concern that we have observed the scope of the exercise being whittled down by developed countries in the course of the Committee's work  particularly with respect to enhancing the capability of the United Nations Secretariat to meet the demands involved in establishing the new order. Jamaica will therefore be keenly interested in the actions to be taken by the General Assembly at this session in the light of the anticipated report of the Ad Hoc Committee.308.	We stress the absolute necessity of developing rational structures and processes that can better serve the international community. They are essential and  if relevant and effective  they can greatly assist our work. The issues on our agenda-issues involving  for example  the arms race  the intractable nature of racist regimes  the Middle East and the reorganization of the world's economic system-which will command our attention during the coming weeks require far more of us than skills and talents in institutional engineering and diplomatic virtuosity.309.	Yesterday we Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the States members of the Group of 77 reaffirmed our unmistakable determination to eradicate the ills that have for so long plagued mankind. We restated with one voice the principles that should guide the international community in this undertaking.310.	Time ebbs away. Further delay invites disaster. The entire world community must act now. Failure imperils all mankind. Our mandate is to improve the lives of all the men and women who now occupy this planet and those who will be born on it. This is our mandate  as simple to state as it is at times difficult to implement.311.	Conscious of this  we renew our faith in the capacity of the United Nations to serve humanity. Simultaneously we will continue to challenge it and ourselves to fulfil its great and noble task."
"67",3559,"JOR",32,1977,"﻿85.	Mr. President  it is a privilege to join the distinguished speakers who have preceded me on this rostrum in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. It is indeed a categorical acknowledgement of your outstanding qualities of statesmanship and a deep recognition of the constructive role your country  Yugoslavia  has played  and continues to play  in its firm support of the aims and objectives of the United Nations and its Charter. In wishing you success in this difficult task  we cannot fail to mention  with praise and appreciation  your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  whose wisdom  courage and indefatigable efforts were among the most prominent features of the previous session.86.	I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express the deep respect and profound appreciation in which Jordan holds the person of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his valuable and unrelenting efforts in realizing the objectives and aspirations of the United Nations.87.	Allow me to express Jordan's great pleasure at the admission to United Nations membership of Djibouti  whose membership in the League of Arab States we also cherish  and to wish its brotherly people continued growth  advancement and prosperity.88.	I should also like to extend Jordan's warm welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose membership in the United Nations comes as the culmination of a quarter of a century of bitter sacrifices by the courageous Vietnamese people  and to wish them every success in their efforts at development  rehabilitation and reconstruction.89.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and his realistic appraisal of its achievements and the current world problems is a true and sober expression of the Organization's attainments and shortfalls in terms of its defined objectives  namely  spreading peace throughout the globe  disarmament  combating racism and apartheid  eliminating the wide gap between rich and poor nations  the establishment of a new economic order  the successful conclusion of the Law of the Sea Conference  and other actions and measures designed to achieve international solidarity and global interdependence in support of right  freedom  justice and human dignity.90.	For mankind  1977 came in as a year of great expectations  to quote the Secretary-General Yet  as it nears its end  we find ourselves delicately and precariously poised between modest achievements and grave misgivings and doubt.91.	As a result  a certain measure of pessimism is casting its dark shadow on the international community. This is a cause for regret; yet we deem it necessary once again to quote Mr. Waldheim  in explaining this slow pace of progress.""Membership in the United Nations is  in the first place  the recognition of a balance between the sovereign rights and interests of Member States and their obligations under the Charter."" It is my Government's considered opinion that the predominance of capricious  short-sighted national self- interest over the long-term interests of mankind  which has in recent times become the rule rather than the exception  constitutes the major challenge to the United Nations. Unless those two kinds of interests can be reconciled  the will of the international community respected and the United Nations resolutions implemented  and until defiance of that will and deviation from the norms of international dealings are punished  and if an end is not put to the audacious and disdainful disregard of those resolutions  the fate of the United Nations will remain subjected to the most serious dangers.92.	The era of colonialism has come to a close. Peoples have been emancipated  but some are still suffering from the remaining vestiges of either the old colonialism  or neo-colonialism. Sooner or later  they  too  will attain their freedom  complete and undiminished  and exercise full sovereignty over their fates and resources.93.	Helping them achieve their aspirations to a better life through shortening the phases of their development is at once a humanitarian and an enlightened act  the fruition of which  over both the short and long run  will serve the interests of rich and poor nations alike. If the North-South dialogue has not achieved its desired objectives yet  the common interest will undoubtedly prevail in the end. We know of no single short-cut to the establishment of the new international economic order  but we are certain that a genuine dialogue and not a futile confrontation will provide us with more experience  vision and wisdom in finding the road and following it.94.	The question of war and peace  whether globally or regionally  must be the preoccupation of the United Nations  for on it hinges the survival of humanity. Yet  to a large extent  this is a responsibility of the super-Powers. It is they who must come to grips with the issues of strategic arms limitation and  hopefully  thereafter  mutually acceptable levels of disarmament. Regretfully  we notice that expenditure on armaments exceeds $300 billion per annum  and that what is taking place is a continuous spiralling of the arms race and a never-ending search for new and even more destructive weapons systems. If anything should go wrong  none of us will be spared.95.	It has been the fate of the sisterly State of Lebanon to experience  during the past two years  a tragic ordeal from which some small pockets of its territory are still suffering  due to external causes that do not augur well for Lebanon. However  Jordan would like to express its great satisfaction and profound happiness at seeing this sisterly State  having passed from this ordeal  accelerating the pace of its reconstruction and exercising once more its cultural and intellectual role as cherished and respected part of our Arab world.96.	Another issue commanding the attention of Jordan is the tragic conflict in Cyprus. Jordan maintains a historical and long-standing friendship with both Greece and Turkey  and earnestly hopes that the intensive efforts at resolving the conflict between the two Cypriot communities will meet with success within the framework of the independence of the Cypriot people  their territorial integrity and the mutual recognition of both communities in accordance with whatever agreement is reached between them.97.	The emancipation of Namibia has been on the agenda of the United Nations since 1946  and yet the independence of Namibia remains unresolved and faces problems and impediments. We appreciate the efforts which the General Assembly has made  the guidelines and principles which the Security Council set forth in resolution 385(1976) and  recently  the efforts of certain Western Powers to transform words into deeds and to achieve this independence.98.	But  tragically  the obstinacy of the discredited South African regime continues to abort any real and meaningful solution based on the inalienable right of the peoples of South West Africa to sovereign independence.99.	In Southern Rhodesia a handful of exploiting landlords continues to stand in the way of an independent Zimbabwe  based on ""one man  one vote"" suffrage  thereby blocking the freedom of its 4 million indigenous inhabitants.100.	The abominable theory and practice of apartheid in South Africa continues to be an affront to the conscience and moral values of humankind in its entirety  as expressed within the United Nations and outside of it  and in the various world conferences held during this year  the latest being at Lagos  Nigeria. World opinion is becoming not only more aware  but intensely more committed to active solidarity with the oppressed black majority of South Africa. While a break-through is in its incipient stages  it is inevitable that mounting world pressures  if properly and effectively organized  will force a change in favour of elemental human decency and the vindication of the inalienable human rights of the oppressed black majority in South Africa.101.	In the Middle East  the year 1977 started with an aura of guarded optimism. Statesmen  both within and outside of the Middle East  indulged in concentrated efforts with a view to ending the long ordeal of its people  and particularly the indescribable suffering of the people of Palestine. The Arab countries have expressed an unmistakable willingness to opt for a just and lasting peace. This willingness was reiterated by Jordan and communicated to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  when he visited the region in February of this year. It was communicated with equal emphasis when the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Cyrus R. Vance  visited the area in July of this year. The position of Jordan is still positive and clear-cut. The position which we had put forward was based on the following principles: first  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the territories occupied in 1967  in accordance with Security Council resolution 242(1967) and 338 (1973); secondly  the fulfilment of the legitimate and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-identity and self-determination in its homeland  Palestine  in accordance with the Charter and relevant resolutions of the United Nations; thirdly  the enabling of the refugee people of Palestine .to exercise its right to choose between repatriation or compensation according to General Assembly resolution 194(111)  which is reaffirmed year after year; and  fourthly  acceptance of peace obligations within secure and recognized borders for all States concerned  in addition to security guarantees for both sides and any other arrangements or guarantees which may be deemed necessary.102.	Jordan has supported the resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East at the earliest possible date with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization. Inspired by the unity of the cause  it then proposed the formation of a single unified Arab delegation to attend the peace negotiations in order to ensure the participation of all parties  since the question of Palestine is too broad for any one Arab country to assume responsibility for it. His Majesty King Hussein has repeatedly stated that it is inevitable  if a permanent and just peace is to be achieved in the region  that the Palestinian people should be enabled to exercise its right to self-determination and to shoulder the responsibility for its own decisions.103.	The bleak view taken of the chances for peace in the Middle East is  first and foremost  the result of Israel's disregard of the Palestinian dimension in the crisis  its keeping 3.5' million Palestinians under occupation or dispersed throughout the world  its refusal to negotiate with the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people  its establishment of settlements in the occupied Arab territories and the legalization of those already established  its violation of human rights in the occupied territories  the application of Israeli laws to the Arab inhabitants of those territories  its colonialist practices in an era of decolonization and public statements by the Israeli military establishment denying the existence of occupied territories but later calling them ""administered territories"" and  finally  ""liberated territories"" and considering them as an integral part of the ""greater"" State of Israel..104.	All those acts were perpetrated by Israel in violation of the principles of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and in defiance of the conscience of the world  whose repeated resolutions fell on deaf Israeli ears* and were met with audacious disrespect for the international community. Israel has always claimed in all forums that it is not only desirous of peace and seeking to achieve it  but that it is also prepared to offer more concessions if only the Arabs would agree to negotiate with it. Yet  when it became convinced that the Arab States directly involved  including the Palestinians  were serious and in earnest about real peace  Israel was evidently caught short and began resorting to various manoeuvres to delay effective steps towards peace. Thus its true designs  which had long been shrouded in ambivalent semantics  if not outright deceit  had to be exposed.105.	Last week-end  on 1 October  a joint United States-USSR statement was issued concerning the Middle East problem  and it has been carefully studied by my Government. My Government found in that statement a positive development on the road towards achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East crisis. It not only came as the culmination of the sincere efforts which the United States had made in co-operation with the Government of the Soviet Union but it also represented an embodiment of the international will as expressed by the various organs of the United Nations  including the General Assembly. In noting the balance struck bet^ en the principles of settlement contained in the statement  particularly the right of the Palestinians to recover their legitimate rights  the Government of Jordan would like to stress that it finds in the statement a sound major step which could be the stepping-stone to positive movement towards peace negotiations at Geneva. It sincerely hopes that this statement will elicit a response from all other parties desirous of preserving their vital interests in building a just and lasting peace and keenly interested in world peace  which the international community is striving to preserve and strengthen.106.	Earlier  on 29 June in fact  the nine States members of the European Community also issued a statement affirming those same principles and calling for the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to establish its own homeland on its territory of Palestine. In expressing our appreciation to the European States for this development in their position as a group  we also recall  with all due gratefulness and appreciation  the noble positions taken by the members of the socialist bloc  the non-aligned countries  the Islamic States  the African and Latin American countries and all other friendly States and their support over the years  both inside and outside the United Nations  of the cause of the Palestinian people by backing right and justice and by condemning the illegal Israeli occupation.107.	The whole world is now at odds with Israel  which stands isolated in a position in which its military establishment is defying the world. And in this open confrontation  the Zionist pressure groups here and there exerting feverish efforts to justify Israeli occupation  expansion and settlements and its uprooting and dispersal of a whole people. Israel has been placing obstacles in the face of peace and rejecting the Geneva Conference.108.	It is no exaggeration to stress  in closing  that the few days and months ahead will be of momentous importance to peace and stability not only in the Middle East but also in the world at large  directly or indirectly.109.	Jordan staunchly supports the peace option. But it takes two sides to consummate a peace and each must exert sincere and unswerving efforts to that end. If Israel opts for that road  we shall no doubt reach that goal. Should it continue to defy the unanimous will of the international community  we shall have no alternative but to reappraise our options  depending on Members' support in achieving justice  curbing the aggressor and taking the effective and deterrent action stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations to preserve peace in the region and the entire world.

"68",3606,"JPN",32,1977,"﻿50.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Government of Japan I wish to congratulate you  Mr. Mojsov  on your election as President of the thirty- second session of the General Assembly. I am confident that under your able leadership this session of the General Assembly will prove to be most fruitful.51.	I should also like to express my respects to Ambassador Amerasinghe  who guided the thirty-first session to a successful conclusion. I trust that he will continue to exercise his great skill as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.52.	May I also pay my sincere respects to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his solid work and devotion to the Organization. I am sure that he will continue to do his utmost for the realization of the important goals of the United Nations.53.	Japan  since the end of the Second World War  has firmly adhered to the policy of conducting its international relations exclusively through peaceful means  trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples of the world and renouncing the use of force as a means of settling international disputes. It is on the basis of this fundamental policy that Japan has taken a number of initiatives in the context of international efforts for nuclear and other forms of disarmament and has itself refrained from exporting military weapons.54.	Confident that these policies directly serve the United Nations purpose of maintaining international peace and security  my country is resolved to continue exerting all its efforts towards world peace and stability.55.	We find it encouraging from such a standpoint that hostilities have ended in Asia and that a peaceful and stable environment is emerging in which the nations in the region can concentrate on their economic and social development.56.	In South-East Asia the nations which 10 years ago formed the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are continuing to work together for their economic and social well-being as well as the strengthening of social justice  while expressing their firm determination to settle any differences that may arise among themselves exclusively by peaceful means. They have also emphasized their joint desire to develop peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with other nations of South-East Asia.57.	In Indo-China  serious efforts are under way towards reconstruction and rehabilitation by the countries in the area. Japan was early in establishing diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam  and has consistently worked to establish friendly relations with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. I therefore heartily welcome the fact that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has been unanimously admitted to the United Nations at this session.58.	Prime Minister Fukuda summarized the basic policy of Japan towards South-East Asia in the speech he made when lie was in Manila last month.59.	First  Japan  a nation committed to peace  rejects the role of a military Power and is resolved to contribute to the peace and prosperity of South-East-Asia and of the world as a whole.60.	Secondly  Japan  as a country seeking genuine friendship with South-East Asia  will do its best to consolidate the relationship of mutual confidence and trust based on heart-to-heart understanding with these countries.61.	Thirdly  Japan  as an equal partner of the ASEAN countries  will co-operate positively with its members in their efforts at self-help and solidarity in all fields  including economic development  trade and cultural exchange  while aiming at fostering a relationship based on mutual understanding with the nations of Indo-China. Japan will thus contribute to the building of peace and prosperity throughout South-East Asia.62.	In South-West Asia  the momentum is building for the normalization and the consolidation of peaceful relations among the countries of the region  so that each country may pursue the development objectives which are best suited to its own requirements. Japan is determined to continue its co-operation with these countries for their development. At the same time Japan will seek closer collaboration with those countries in various international forums towards the solution of problems which confront the international community at large.63.	Unfortunately  a degree of tension persists on the Korean peninsula  an area in closest proximity to Japan. However  a confrontation on the Korean question is about to be avoided at the present session of the General Assembly  as it was last year. I sincerely hope this will eventually lead to the lessening of tensions on the peninsula itself.64.	Since the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula are of deep concern to Japan  we continue to hope earnestly that a dialogue between the South and the North of Korea will be promptly resumed  and their reunification will be achieved through peaceful means. Meanwhile  I appeal to all nations to co-operate in fostering a more tranquil environment  which will facilitate such a dialogue.65.	Japan maintains its position that  if each of them so desires  it would welcome the admission to the United Nations of the South and the North of Korea in the interval before the peaceful reunification of the peninsula.66.	To sum up  Japan holds strong hopes that the momentum of current efforts towards construction and development will spread in conditions of peace and stability throughout Asia  and take hold in every country. At the same time  it is my earnest hope that the countries of Asia  in their efforts to achieve stability and development  will benefit from the understanding and co-operation of the countries outside the region  while remaining free of external interference in their own affairs.67.	I have long admired the Latin American tradition of regional co-operation  especially of resolving  in a spirit of mutual understanding  problems arising within the region. I was much impressed to see the leaders of Latin America gathering together earlier this month on the occasion of the signing of the new Panama Canal treaties. I should like to extend my congratulations that the Panama Canal issue is being resolved through peaceful negotiations.68.	It is the firm intention of Japan to expand its co-operation with the nations of Latin America so as to strengthen our friendly relations with them.69.	Without question  the Middle East problem today has a most important bearing upon the maintenance of international peace and stability. Japan wishes to render its full support to the devoted efforts of Secretary Vance of the United States to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  and the serious endeavours that are being made by the leaders of the countries concerned to achieve a peaceful settlement of the problem.70.	We very sincerely hope that the parties concerned  including Israel  the Arab States directly involved and the Palestine Liberation Organization  as representative of the Palestinians  will be able to start talks in Geneva before the year is out.71.	The basis for attaining peace in the Middle East lies in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  plus the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people under the Charter of the United Nations  particularly their right to self-determination.72.	The acquisition and occupation of territories by force cannot be allowed  and accordingly Israeli armed forces should be withdrawn from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war. On the other hand  the political independence and territorial integrity of all the countries concerned  including Israel  should be guaranteed. It is just as necessary that the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people be recognized  respected and fulfilled in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.73.	In this connexion  the Government of Japan considers most regrettable the measures which the Government of Israel has been taking with regard to settlements on the West Bank of the River Jordan. We strongly urge the Government of Israel to refrain from any measures which may alter the status quo  thus rendering the solution to the problem even more difficult.74.	We hope that serious efforts to accelerate the process towards a peaceful settlement will continue to be made during the current session of the General Assembly. As a member of the international community  Japan  for its part  will contribute in any way it can to the early attainment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.75.	The situation in southern Africa  if it continues  is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. We have to attain in southern Africa  as promptly as possible and by peaceful means  the elimination of racial discrimination  decolonization and majority rule. We all expect the United Nations to play an effective role in that process.76.	Regarding the problem of Southern Rhodesia  Japan wishes to express its understanding of and support for the nationalist movement of Zimbabwe. We pay our respect to the efforts being made by the five front-line States. We also appreciate the initiative that is being taken jointly by the United Kingdom and the United States. Japan will continue to co-operate in international efforts to realize a peaceful solution to the problem and  for this purpose  it will observe fully the economic sanctions imposed upon Southern Rhodesia.77.	With regard to Namibia  independence should be attained in accordance with Security Council resolution 385(1976)  with the participation of SWAPO and all the inhabitants of Namibia. Japan supports the serious efforts of the five member States of the Security Council in search of a peaceful solution to the problem  and we are prepared to play our part in United Nations efforts to resolve this problem.78.	The positions to be adopted by the Government of the Republic of South Africa will be decisive in all aspects of the problems of southern Africa. Japan urges the South African Government to be attentive to the international call for the elimination of racial discrimination and to render its full co-operation towards the earliest possible solution of these problems. In particular  the Government of the Republic of South Africa should co-operate fully with the international efforts now under way for the peaceful settlement of the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia. Should  the Republic of South Africa fail to do so the consequences could be serious  given the intensified denunciation of the South African attitude.79.	Recent reports on the possible development of a nuclear capability by South Africa are a matter of grave concern to the international community as they imply a further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such a step might also bring to nought all efforts to date to achieve a peaceful solution of the problems of southern Africa. Japan therefore urges the South African Government to desist from this dangerous path.80.	I should like to take this opportunity to express a warm welcome to the Republic of Djibouti  which has recently attained independence and become a Member of this Organization. We extend the hand of friendship to this newly born Republic  offering our co operation towards its economic and social development.81.	It is basic Japanese policy to enhance friendship and mutual co-operation with the African nations. Japan extends its full support to the achievement of the common goals of the African Peoples concerning the problems of southern Africa and nation-building. Japan intends  therefore  to expand human exchanges  economic and technical co-operation and all other forms of co-operation to realize the aspirations of the African peoples.82.	A special session of the General Assembly on disarmament will be convened in May next year. Sustained progress in the field of disarmament is of fundamental importance to the maintenance of international peace. Japan is therefore determined to continue its positive efforts in this field as we prepare for the success of the special session.83.	Japan considers nuclear disarmament the most crucial task in the field of disarmament. My Government  therefore  is making positive contributions  including technical proposals which would facilitate a comprehensive nuclear test-ban  which we regard as the first and most urgent step in the direction of nuclear disarmament.84.	Japan adheres strictly to the three principles of not possessing  not manufacturing and not permitting the entry into Japan of nuclear weapons. Furthermore  Japan became a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons so as to contribute to the prevention of nuclear war.85.	I need hardly point out that the Treaty contains a built-in inequality between the nuclear-weapon and the non-nuclear-weapon States. In order to rectify this inequality  and thereby strengthen the regime for the prevention of nuclear proliferation  renewed efforts must be made on the part of the nuclear-weapon States to achieve nuclear disarmament. At the same time I wish to emphasize that the inalienable right of the non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy must be substantiated.86.	It is a matter of grave concern that recent increases in the stockpiles of conventional weapons have aggravated the danger of armed conflict in certain areas of the world. The arms race in conventional weapons and the acceleration of international transfers of these weapons merit continuous and serious examination by the international community and should be taken up  in particular  as one of the major items for discussion at the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.87.	The promotion of the economic and social development of the developing countries is  along with the maintenance of international peace and security  a principal task confronting the United Nations today. My country fully recognizes the aspirations of the developing countries for the establishment of a new international economic order. The establishment of such a new order needs to be understood as a constantly evolving and dynamic process and it is Japan's intention to co-operate constructively in this common effort.88.	The time has come for the preparation of an international development strategy for  the 1980s. At this juncture I should like to raise the following points.89.	First  policies and measures which truly contribute to the development of the developing countries and to the sound growth of the world economy as a whole should be promoted positively. In this regard I should like to emphasize the importance of agricultural development along with industrial development. Agricultural development involves complex relationships among man  land and institutions and therefore it requires a comprehensive approach.90.	Second  although it. is the main concern of the world to narrow the gap in income levels between the North and the South  it is essential to take into account the diverse stages of development among the developing countries  as well as the diversity of economic and social needs in different countries. Especially careful attention must be given to the needs of the least developed countries.91.	Third  I believe it is essential for all people to be able to participate directly in the development process and to share in its benefits. This cannot be achieved without serious attention to social development  especially in those areas which meet the basic requirements of human life  in addition to those which contribute directly to raising incomes. Needless to say  it should be left to each nation to formulate its own development plans  and to determine what are the basic needs of its people  and in which fields of social development the national priority should be set.92.	Meeting the basic requirements of human life is essential to the dignity of man and respect for human rights.93.	I should now like to touch briefly on what Japan intends to do for the economic and social development of the developing countries.94.	First of all  I wish to state that Japan intends to more than double its official development assistance in five years.95.	In the field of trade  Japan will give maximum possible consideration to the needs of the developing countries in the multilateral trade negotiations  in compliance with the objectives of the Tokyo Declaration of 1973. Japan attaches special importance to the need for the establishment of a common fund for primary commodities  and we earnestly hope a satisfactory agreement will be reached on its modalities at the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities to be resumed in November. I should also like to affirm Japan's intention to participate actively in the existing international commodity agreements and to consider positively the necessary measures leading to Japan's voluntary contribution to the buffer stock of the Fifth International Tin Agreement. Moreover  we shall continue to strive  at the United Nations and in various other forums  to find solutions to those problems on which agreement has not yet been reached in past international talks  notably the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.96.	As we approach the twenty-first century  Japan will do its utmost in the global effort to raise the  curtain of poverty .97.	The United Nations is now tackling the problems of the sea  which has been called one of mankind's last frontiers. I do believe that  in our protracted journey over the past decade  beset by hardships in our search for a new legal order of the sea  we have reached the point where we need more than ever mutual understanding and co-operation. The United Nations must overcome the formidable challenge of establishing  at the earliest possible date  a fair maritime order which will be acceptable to all countries. Japan  as a maritime nation  will continue to co-operate in the formulation of a new law of the sea.98.	Finally  I should like to touch on some aspects of the United Nations itself which are of particular interest to my Government.99.	First  there is a constant need to review the structure and functions of the United Nations in the light of developments on the international scene. During the 32 years since the establishment of the United -Nations profound changes have taken place in the role each country plays in international relations. It is my earnest hope that the work now under way in the United Nations in this field  including that on Charter review  will produce constructive results reflecting these realities.100.	Second  I should like to deal with the question of the status of the group of Asian States in major United Nations forums. The number of countries in the Asian group is now as much as 37  and the total population of the countries in this group has reached 2.3 billion people  which is more than half the world's population. States members of this group  in accordance with their respective standpoints  have been making positive contributions to the various activities of the United Nations. It is the unanimous view of all States members of the group that appropriate status and opportunities should be accorded to it in various United Nations forums. I believe early action should be taken in order to remedy the under-representation of the Asian group at elections to the major United Nations bodies.101.	Third  one notes that political considerations tend to play a somewhat excessive role in the work of some of the specialized agencies. While recognizing that the discussions in those bodies reflect the political realities of the world  we must not lose sight of the original objectives of these agencies. We must all co-operate to promote the smooth and efficient functioning of the specialized agencies.103. Fourth  it is now four years since the United Nations University was established as the centre of a global network of research efforts to tackle fundamental problems facing mankind  such as resources  the environment  population and food. Japan has made substantial contributions to the University. However  the University is urgently in need of wider support in order to perform fully the role it is expected to play. I wish to appeal to the Member States for such support.1G4. The major Powers comprising the permanent membership of the Security Council have important roles to play and heavy responsibilities to discharge in the United Nations of today. It is my earnest hope that these countries will continue to put their power and wisdom to the most effective use on behalf of the common objectives of all mankind-namely  the maintenance of world peace and co-operation for development.105.	At the same time  I must emphasize that every other State Member of the United Nations bears its own share of the responsibility for world peace and development. Japan  a non-nuclear-weapon State  is committed to the ideals and activities of the United Nations and is determined to play a greater role in building international peace and attaining the other high objectives of the United Nations. "
"69",3678,"KEN",32,1977,"﻿55.	 Mr. President  your election is a great tribute to you personally and to your country  with which Kenya maintains very cordial relations. Yugoslavia has been in the forefront of the struggle for non-alignment in international affairs and is a champion of freedom  equality and dignity. Kenya is proud to be its friend. My delegation is satisfied to work under your enlightened and wise leadership and I should like to assure you  Sir  of our full co-operation.56.	I wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your eminent predecessor Ambassador Amerasinghe  whoguided the General Assembly so ably during a difficult session. It was thanks to his calm wisdom and vast experience that we were able to deal effectively with many difficult problems  and we owe him a debt of gratitude for all he did for the United Nations and the world.57.	Our sincere thanks go also to our untiring Secretary- General and his staff for their devotion to duty and loyalty to the Organization. They have our support.58.	My delegation is very happy to welcome among us the two new Members of our Organization  namely  the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. I extend to them a most sincere and warm welcome and I should like to assure them of our co-operation in the deliberations and work of this Organization.59.	The admission of Djibouti and Viet Nam is a significant milestone on the road of the struggle against all forms of colonial domination. The heroic struggle waged by those two States against colonialism is well known to all of us. Their triumph is indeed a bright light for those still under colonial domination and oppression. It is a significant step in rendering irreversible the trend towards ridding this world of the inhuman practice of colonialism. We are confident that they will always jealously guard their sovereignty which has been won at such great human and material cost.60.	As we are meeting here  a savage war is ravaging the Horn of Africa  with all the ramifications that entails for international peace and security. My country cannot but be very concerned and it is for this reason that we draw the attention of this august body to a most dangerous situation developing in that area. If all members of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations respected the principles and charters of the two bodies  perhaps dangers to international peace and security posed by the war and the risk of external interference in the internal affairs of member States in that subregion would not have arisen. We must all agree to respect the territorial integrity of each member State.61.	Southern Africa continues to constitute a main centre of tension in the world today  threatening peace and international security. The white minority regimes continue to oppress and exploit the black majority with increasing brutality and ruthless savagery. As I pointed out last year  it is not sufficient for us to recognize that the racial policies of these regimes constitute a threat to international peace and security. What is needed most is agreement on a programme of practical steps and measures to be taken to put an end to this threat.62.	The International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo  and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos  were clear indications of the determination of the international community to grapple with the problems of the area. My delegation pledges Kenya's full and unswerving support for the declarations and programmes of action ofMaputo and Lagos and calls for their implementation without delay.63.	In complete disregard of the opinion of the international community  the racist regime in South Africa continues to intensify the application of the diabolical and inhuman policies of apartheid with greater determination. The indignation of the world community over the barbarous murders of innocent children in Soweto last year did nothing to jolt the conscience of the racists in South Africa. Instead  the racist regime continues to maim and kill innocent children whose only crime is to demand their inalienable rights to dignity and equality. The barbarity of the regime has been exposed further by the murder of peaceful and young Steven Biko. They have told us that they have no intention of relenting. We have pointed out on numerous occasions that the tree of freedom is watered with blood  and Vorster is determined to see it flow. So let Vorster and his clique know that no amount of murder or intimidation will reverse the hands of the clock of freedom in Azania. Africans have avoided blood thus far  but let white South Africans reflect. They can only continue with their acts at their gravest peril. Their blood can also be shed.64.	This world Assembly rejected the antics of Vorster when it rejected the so-called independence of the Transkei. No sooner had this resounding defeat been inflicted on the policies of apartheid than Vorster instigated a blockade of land-locked Lesotho. We condemn such acts as illegal and call on all peace-loving countries to assist Lesotho and Botswana in their predicament.65.	The entire world was treated recently to contradictory statements from officials of the same regime regarding the reported preparedness of South Africa to explode a nuclear device. Africa had issued a warning against giving any technological assistance in the field of nuclear know-how to South Africa  but its warnings  unfortunately  fell on deaf ears. In pursuit of short-term economic gains  some countries had aided South Africa to arm itself to an extent that is obviously dangerous to peace and security  not only in the region  but in the world as a whole. All previous pretensions that these arms were given for the defensive needs of South Africa had been unconvincing. No one else in Africa has nuclear capability and it would be sheer hypocrisy .for anybody to argue that South Africa needs to defend its territory by the use of nuclear weapons. We are convinced that South Africa wants to use this capability to intimidate black African States in their efforts to aid the freedom fighters in Azania. But even nuclear bombs will not deter the African fight for freedom. Those who helped South Africa with knowledge and nuclear fuel should advise against its ideas; it will burn itself as it tried to burn the rest of us. In any case  the rest of Africa might be driven to seek the same capability in time  so the nuclear club would expand instead of shrinking  which would be a real disaster.66.	Because of appalling conditions in South Africa for our people  despite United Nations resolutions which have remained unheeded  Kenya has resolved to assist the freedom fighters of Azania further and to a greater extent materially  both through bilateral and multilateral avenues. We call upon all Member States to increase their support for the cause of freedom and dignity. The prolonged misery of the oppressed black majority has increased their bitterness with the inevitable consequence of terrible racial conflagration. We call upon all Member States to implement the United Nations resolutions against South Africa as a lever to persuade it to change its dangerous course. We appeal especially to those countries that have economic influence in South Africa to use their power to ensure that this weapon is used to force the short-sighted white minority to change their attitude and -share the fruits of self- determination on an equitable and fair basis with the other communities in South Africa.67.	Africa will not be satisfied with the token removal of petty racism in public places. What we are calling for is a complete removal of all racial laws and practices. Until that is done  Kenya calls for the total isolation of South Africa in all fields. That is the price we are asking the international community to pay for the cause of human rights and dignity in Azania  and we think it is a small price compared with the immense loss of human lives that will obviously occur if we sit back and do nothing  leaving the freedom fighters no option but to wrench their freedom from the hands of the minority regime in a violent confrontation..68.	Last year  my country called upon South Africa to leave Namibia and to hand over power to the Namibian people. We rejected the so-called constitutional talks and the arrangement of hand-picked ethnic delegates not only as illegal and obnoxious  but also as delaying tactics by Vorster in surrendering power.69.	Kenya has stated again and again that it does not recognize the authority of South Africa in Namibia. The international community has also stated on many occasions that it does not recognize the authority of South Africa in Namibia. What is needed therefore is not any more condemnations of the illegal regime for its illegal occupation of Namibia. What is needed is action to dislodge the illegal regime from that African territory.70.	Since we last met a group of countries from the West has contacted South Africa and persuaded it to change its attitude and Hand over Namibia to the Namibians. While we cannot doubt the good intentions of those countries  my delegation would like to give a warning that Vorster can no longer be trusted on matters relating to the self- determination of Namibia. In 1974 he vowed that if he were given only six months the world would be surprised by the changes that he would effect in Namibia. It is now over three years since we were asked to listen to what appeared to be a  voice of reason . The situation in Namibia has not improved. Instead  Vorster has repeatedly found one reason after another to create impediments to the immediate transfer of power to Namibians. We should like  therefore  to caution the contact group to be wary of his tactics and not to rely on his promises alone as the basis for progress in the solution of the Namibian issue. We would  rather  call upon them to use all other available means  including military sanctions and economic measures that would force the regime in South Africa to act faster. All States should support and implement a total embargo on the sale  gift or transfer of arms to South Africa. We call upon all concerned to put respect for human dignity and rights above short-term economic interests and to cut their economic ties with South Africa as long as that country continues to defy the United Nations and occupy Namibia illegally.71.	We have always maintained-and we shall continue to do so—that there can be no permanent solution of the Namibian problem unless the people of Namibia are consulted through their proper representatives. For this reason we insist that the South West Africa People's Organization should be fully involved at every stage of the- negotiations and progress towards independence. If no real progress is achieved the war of liberation should continue until freedom is won.72.	We are meeting when again hopes for a negotiated settlement of the Zimbabwe situation are being expressed. Ironically  when the Assembly was meeting last year hopes were also high that at last a solution might be at hand for this intractable problem. Kenya was not convinced then that rebel Smith was honest when he said that he was prepared to accept majority rule in Zimbabwe. Events since then have proved that Smith was only buying time. He had no intention whatsoever of handing power to the black majority. As we sit here today he is still dreaming of  and trying to establish  a so-called responsible Government consisting of the whites and a handful of hand-picked African stooges. He calls it an internal solution.73.	Kenya has stated on many occasions that there can be no sense or logic in seeking peaceful negotiations with an incorrigible rebel and that the only language such a rebel understands is force. We urged the United Kingdom Government  the administering Power  to take appropriate measures to remove the rebel from its colony. However  the present Anglo-American proposals attempt to restore the British presence in Rhodesia by the appointment of a British resident commissioner. While Kenya welcomes the return of British say in Southern Rhodesia  the United Kingdom and Smith cannot surely coexist  for the unilateral declaration of independence and legality are diametrically opposed. We are not convinced that Smith will step down voluntarily  however  and we therefore call on the Governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States to ensure that he is forced out. Until he goes Kenya will continue to support the armed struggle and the strict application of sanctions against the rebel Government. All peace-loving people should increase their material and moral support to the freedom fighters until genuine prospects for majority rule in Zimbabwe cannot be reversed. Our support for continued armed struggle should not be seen as obstruction  but experience has taught us that Africa's best guarantee of liberation is the freedom fighter and his gun.74.	The Anglo-American proposals appear promising  but at no time should Smith have the last word or they would lose their value in the minds of many of us. Kenya is in agreement with the proposal to have the presence of the United Nations in the Territory through a representative of the Secretary-General. It is our strong view  however  that such involvement of the United Nations must not be viewed as in any way providing for a reduction in the ultimate responsibility of the administering Power to ensure a rapid and complete transfer of power to the black majority of Zimbabwe.75.	Kenya  of course  is in favour of the proposal for the early holding of elections to choose the leaders that will guide independent Zimbabwe. We believe that the Zimbabwe people  given the opportunity and without interference  can freely choose their leaders on the basis of one man or woman  one vote. A Government so elected will have our supreme support but  as I say  Smith  his rebel and illegal Government and the Scouts must go immediately as a start. The mercenaries and other undesirable elements in the army cannot be trusted and similarly should go. It should become clear that in the event of insecurity the freedom fighters would have the upper hand. They are the Zimbabweans' best guarantee of safety and genuine independence.76.	The proposal can therefore only be considered as offering a basis for further negotiations and not as a package deal. We would therefore urge that the steps necessary for the commencement of such negotiations be taken urgently before the will and resolution of those involved are dampened again by Smith's obstructionist tactics.77.	I turn now to the Middle East  which continues to be a region fraught with all the elements of danger to international peace and security. The hopes that had been raised at the beginning of the year that peace is possible in the region have been severely shaken by recent events there.78.	Kenya has stated  and I want to repeat  that peace in the area can only prevail if the following three conditions are fulfilled: first  the recognition of the right of all States in the region to live in peace and within secure and recognized boundaries  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973); secondly  the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab lands that it has continued to occupy since the war of 1967; and thirdly  the recognition of the human rights of the Palestinians as a people and their right to an independent and truly sovereign homeland.79.	We have noted with much regret that Israel has continuously disregarded the resolutions of this Organization concerning the Arab territories it occupies. The Israelis  against all reason and international opinion  have been engaged in changing the demographic and physical aspects of the region. Therefore Kenya joins the world in condemning Israel for taking these measures that do nothing but threaten international peace and security. We call upon Israel to respect this august body and to desist from building permanent Jewish settlements on occupied Arab lands and the West Bank.80.	I must say that recently we noted with some relief that Israel had agreed to the convening of the Geneva peace talks. As we have stated on many occasions  we consider that for the success of these talks the participation of the Palestinians on an equal basis with all the other parties concerned is essential. The Palestinians have chosen the PLO as their mouthpiece and we should respect that position. The time when the Palestinians were considered only as refugees is long gone. All discussions of the political issues affecting them must of necessity be conducted with them. We therefore urge all concerned not to put any preconditions on the participation of a people so central to peace and security in the region. Eastern Africa is very much concerned that there should be peace with honour in the Middle East. Let no one obstruct progress towards a conference that could bring such enormous advantages to those immediately concerned as well as to the rest of our countries in the Horn of Africa and south of it.81.	It is now over three years since the fragile peace and tranquillity of Cyprus were once again shattered  first by the abortive coup engineered and executed by Greek officers stationed on the island and then by the massive invasion of the island by Turkish forces. The communal talks that have been going on since then have made very little and slow progress  primarily because of external interference.82.	Kenya has always called and will continue to call for respect for and recognition of the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. We urge the people of Cyprus  with whom we have very cordial relations  to bury their sectional interests for the benefit of the entire population of the island. We urge them not to be discouraged by the many obstacles in their way and we call upon all external forces to stop interfering in the internal affairs of non-aligned Cyprus.83.	It is now 32 years since the United Nations was founded with the fundamental desire to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to create conditions of peace and security in the world. While major conflicts have been avoided  we cannot but note with much regret that there still exist many areas of international tension in the world. We note with indignation the threat to international peace and security brought about by the continuation of the diabolical apartheid system and racism in southern Africa. Looking at other areas of tension we find flagrant disrespect for and violate of the territorial integrity of other sovereign States and the occupation of other people's territories by force of arms  contrary to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The continued failure to fulfil the basic daily needs of man in many parts of the world is not conducive to the creation of a climate of tranquillity in which man can spend his  time in pursuit of peace and happiness.84.	The most serious of all the obstacles to peace and security in the world is the ever-escalating armaments race. While everyone agrees that there is an urgent need to halt this dangerous escalation  progress towards arms limitation and reduction is not yet in sight. The proposed special session on disarmament is a first step towards this objective and has my delegation's support. It is  however  the view of my delegation that this session should tackle all the problems of disarmament and should not only examine the question of limitation of armament escalation. It should also work out practical steps for the reduction and eventual elimination of armaments.85.	It is not justifiable for the world to continue pouring billions of dollars into an industry whose sole aim is the development of the most sophisticated machinery of destruction while more than half of the world goes hungry. We once again urge the major manufacturers and countries to consider diverting the human  technological and financial resources which they use for producing arms to fulfilling the economic needs of mankind. Above all  we urge all countries to abide truly by the principles of good neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence as a positive contribution towards the elimination of tension that encourages the escalation of armaments.86.	Kenya is seriously concerned  at the slow progress made by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and the reluctance of a number of States Members of this Organization to the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. The continued build-up of the naval might of the super-Powers in the ocean and the construction of naval and military bases in the region constitute flagrant disregard of the fears and sentiments expressed by all the littoral States that have solemnly declared that they would like the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace. While we note some recent improvement in the willingness of the super-Powers to discuss this subject  we feel that it has not yet been accorded either urgency or the seriousness of consideration which it calls for. In particular  we are aware that during the period of delay in the convening of a conference the super-Powers have continued to expand and intensify their naval and military presence  thus increasing the level of tension in that area.87.	Kenya once again calls on all States to respect this solemn declaration and to ask those that have bases in the zone to remove them so that the States in the region can pursue their development efforts without intimidation.88.	Allow me now to turn to another important subject of vital interest to my country  namely  the on-going negotiations on the law of the sea. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has already held six sessions  the last one having taken place here in New York from 23 May to 15 July 1977.89.	It will be recalled that Kenya's delegations to these negotiations have always played a constructive role in a spirit of compromise  in an effort to evolve a more equitable and just regime for the seas  whose immense resources have up to now been the preserve of the major maritime Powers. The negotiations have so far been lengthy and complex. The seas are of vital importance to each and every nation. Covering well over three-quarters of the surface of our planet  the oceans are vital for the very existence of life  and with the increasing world population they are becoming more and more important as a source of food.90.	As a communications link  it is imperative and of vital importance that the seas shall continue to be open for innocent passage for all nations. At the same time we must arrest the misuse of the oceans as a cesspool for the dumping of wastes and other noxious substances  as the destruction of the seas will inevitably lead to the destruction of life on the earth.91.	The General Assembly solemnly declared that the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and its resources constitute the common heritage of mankind. For us in Kenya this is not a mere slogan. The common heritage concept is an imperative norm and must be translated into a regime which guarantees the developing countries' rights to participate in the exploiting of these resources and protects them against unfair competition from the maritime Powers  which at the moment have more technological capability for exploiting these resources.92.	The Kenya Government is currently studying the results of the sixth session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. Our preliminary view is that the informal composite negotiating text which was produced during the session represents a significant advance and provides a suitable basis for negotiating the final 1raft treaty during  the forthcoming seventh session in Geneva next year.93.	While the informal composite negotiating text does not fully satisfy the wishes of all Member States  we nevertheless believe that if delegations go to the next session determined to work in the spirit of compromise  the text will be of great assistance in reaching the final conclusion. Kenya will go to the next session prepared to negotiate. We shall  however  completely reject any attempt by any State or group of States to dictate terms to others. The failure of the informal composite negotiating text to meet all the aspirations of such States should not be used as a pretext or justification for taking unilateral measures to plunder the resources which are the common heritage of mankind.94.	The Conference has been going on for too long now and my Government  I believe with many other developing countries  is not in a position to continue these negotiations indefinitely. The cost in both manpower and financial resources is too great for countries which have many competing needs. We therefore  urge all Member States to work towards the conclusion of this treaty during the forthcoming session. I would now like to turn to some of the major economic issues which have become so pressing and which need urgent solutions in the interest of justice  equity and peace in the world. The Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation held earlier this year is the latest in a series of efforts to conduct meaningful and objective negotiations on these issues. Earlier  at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  promises and declarations were made which appeared to indicate that the international community had now  at last  realized and fully recognized the realities of economic interdependence and the common destiny of the world. In particular  the sixth special session adopted the Declaration and Programme of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  giving further hopes of an early resolution of the problems of development and international economic co-operation.95.	The developing countries had therefore expected that the Paris Conference would lead to the formulation of a practical programme of action which would lead to negotiations and some measure of agreement towards creating a more just and equitable economic order. In accepting the invitation to participate in this Conference  the developing countries did not expect miracles and did not expect that a new international economic order would be established overnight. However  they expected  quite justifiably  that the developed countries would agree to work positively towards the removal of those obstacles which have persistently been placed in the way of progress towards a more meaningful form of economic co-operation and partnership. These constraints  which have been discussed time and again  are all man-made and can be removed with a little more resolution and political will on the part of the developed countries. The problems were clearly defined in the meeting of the Group of 77 in Manila in 1975  and specific proposals for their resolution were made in the Manila Declaration which was presented at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi in 1976.96.	The recommendations included specific proposals with regard to the establishment of machinery for stabilizing the export earnings of developing countries. Practical measures were proposed for compensatory financing of export shortfalls  the reorganization of commodity markets and the writing off or rescheduling of debts which were already proving too great a burden and an obstacle to development. Suggestions were made as to how to accelerate the transfer of the relevant technology and management skills which are so much needed in the developing countries.97.	After 18 months of discussion in Paris  little progress was made towards an acceptable solution to this problem. The developed countries still appear to believe that the problem can be solved within the traditional concepts of economic co-operation. They invariably point to their commitments to provide more bilateral and multilateral aid  although they know that any increase in aid is more than nullified by inflation and other economic factors beyond our control. They elaborate on the steps they have taken in order to increase private investment in developing countries. And yet we all know the unfortunate role which has been played by private investors in perpetuating the evils of economic domination over developing economies. We know the part they have played in maintaining unfavourable terms of trade and a regime of unjustifiable outflow of profits from the countries of their operation.98.	In this context  we must once again state clearly our position regarding the transnational corporations. The developing countries are no longer prepared to have their destiny in the sphere of economic and trade relations subjugated to the interests of transnational corporations. It is for this reason that we have called upon the United Nations system to establish a code of conduct for those corporations and to establish a realistic capacity to assist developing countries in ensuring that their dealings with transnational corporations are on the basis of equitable sharing of returns from investments. Developing countriesare still awaiting the outcome of those two decisions but  sadly  little progress appears to have been achieved.99.	On the whole  therefore  I feel obliged to voice the increasing disappointments and frustrations of developing countries at the lack of progress in the evolution of a more meaningful international economic order. However  in spite of the failures of those negotiations-not only in Paris but also at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi  at the multilateral trade negotiations under GATT  and the discussions within the IMF—World Bank Group-the developing countries cannot give up hope. To do so would be to accept defeat and to condemn two thirds of mankind for ever to a short life of misery  hunger and social deprivation. We still believe in the justice of our cause and in our conviction that the developed world has the ability to resolve those problems  given more goodwill and political determination.100.	The developing countries themselves have a role to play in furtherance of. this economic evolution. Kenya believes strongly in the promotion of economic and technical co-operation between countries of the developing world. The similarity of our resources as well as our problems  our wishes as well as our capabilities  and the identity of our aspirations and purpose all create a strong base for co-operation in technical  cultural and trade relations.In considering the role of developing countries in a new economic order  we must refer to the question of the management of natural resources and the human environment. As producers of basic raw materials and agricultural commodities  developing countries cannot ignore the irresponsible and reckless way in which mankind has in the past exploited both renewable and non-renewable natural resources. Of the utmost significance at the moment is the whole question of the management of water resources and the halting of the encroachment of deserts on the human environment. This is a problem which has been ignored for too long  to the extent that it now constitutes a menace and a real threat to human life. In this context  my country supported the resolutions of the United Nations Water Conference and of the first United Nations Conference on Desertification  held in Nairobi from 29 August to 9 September of this year. Kenya was honoured to have been host to the latter Conference. We are convinced that the Plan of-Action adopted by the Conference is a milestone on the road to ensuring that appropriate remedial actions are taken to stop mankind from being wiped out by lack of water and food owing to the reckless use of land and its resources.102. The Plan of Action  which is before this session of the General Assembly  reflects the combined efforts of professionals and others working in related fields. While commending their work  and in particular the role of the Secretary-General of the Conference  Mr. Mostafa Tolba  we call on all nations to give the practical support and commitment necessary for the implementation of the Plan of Action. In particular  we ask all nations to contribute generously towards a global effort to combat desertification and its related problems. We ask them to participate vigorously in the subregional and regional efforts recommended in the Plan of Action to ensure that man's habitat is not destroyed while we lethargically watch in a s rte of inaction by the encroachment of deserts.103.	At this point I should like to make a short reference to the question of human settlements  now commonly known as  Habitat . This subject has been discussed at various levels of preparatory committees of the United Nations  the Habitat Conference 15 the UNEP Governing Council and the Economic and Social Council  as well as the General Assembly. Other numerous consultations and discussions have taken place at regional and subregional levels.104.	This session of the General Assembly will be asked to make final decisions on the establishment of  Habitat   its institutional arrangements and its location. My delegation has taken a most active role in all discussions on this subject from the beginning  and we were honoured to chair the United Nations Preparatory Committee for Habitat. We are convinced that the views of all the delegations on this subject have now been fully expressed and examined and that a final decision should be taken at this session of the General Assembly.105.	The problem of human settlements  particularly in the developing countries  is urgent and pressing. Millions of human beings are today living in subhuman conditions waiting for this Assembly to do something concrete to alleviate their misery. Suffice it to say therefore that my delegation  like the overwhelming majority of the members of the Economic and Social Council  will support the consensus recommendation of the sixty-third session of the Economic and Social Council on this subject.16 We fully appreciate that  in an organization like the United Nations -now with 149 Members—it is impossible to have a solution best suited to each Member State's aspirations. It was in the spirit of compromise that my delegation agreed to go along with the majority and adopt a resolution acceptable to most delegations. I should therefore like to appeal to all delegations at this session to adopt the Economic and Social Council recommendation by consensus so that the United Nations agencies concerned can embark of the urgent and difficult task before us of ensuring a more tolerable and meaningful life for the millions of people throughout the world who now know nothing but misery and abject deprivation. "
"70",3749,"KHM",32,1977,"﻿23.	Mr. President  the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea is happy to extend to you its warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election represents a tribute to Yugoslavia  a friendly nation which has always pursued a policy of independence and non-alignment and  through Yugoslavia  it also represents a tribute to the movement and the principles of non-alignment. We offer you our best wishes for success in carrying out your new mission.24.	We should like also warmly to congratulate Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe on his success as President of the thirty-first session of our General Assembly.25.	We extend our warm congratulations and our welcome to the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which is participating in our work for the first time since its complete liberation on 30 April 1975 and the achievement of the unity of the country. We also express our warm congratulations to the Republic of Djibouti on its admission to the United Nations.26.	In the course of the past year the movement of revolutionary struggle  the movement of national liberation  the struggle for the defence of independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and the right of self-determination and the struggle of the oppressed peoples  of the peoples of the non-aligned countries and of the third world to build their nations have made a tremendous forward thrust and have grown prodigiously. This is a new situation which will gladden the hearts of all the world's peoples and will further strengthen their confidence  but which causes panic among imperialists and reactionaries of every kind. By standing firm the struggling peoples have won one victory after another  creating a new situation favourable to the revolutionary cause and to the cause of the national liberation of peoples throughout the world.27.	Faced with this situation  the imperialists and the expansionists  who have suffered one complete defeat after another  are pursuing their subversive activities in various regions of the world in order to stem the victorious tide of the peoples' struggle. They are engaging in psychological warfare and attempting through campaigns of mendacious propaganda to create in the peoples a spirit of impendence and servility vis-à-vis the great Powers. They are interfering in domestic affairs  provoking conflicts  exacerbating contradictions and doing everything possible to divide the movement of the peoples' struggle  to sow discord in the ranks of the non-aligned countries and to undermine the solidarity of the countries of the third world. But the struggling peoples are more and more aware of the truly cruel and stubborn nature of the imperialists and expansionists and of their annexationist ambitions  their aggressive designs and their false and treacherous manoeuvres. That is why the peoples of the world resolutely oppose them.28.	After the failure of the United States policy of aggression in the region and  in particular  after the complete collapse of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization  the peoples of South-East Asia  having seen through the designs of the imperialists  the expansionists and their partisans  stepped up their struggle in full independence and sovereignty and have resorted to their own means to achieve their aspirations to independence  peace  neutrality and genuine democracy in their respective countries  without military bases or foreign troops on their national territories. The peoples of the countries in that region are resolutely opposed to all forms of foreign interference and intervention  so that their countries may live in genuine independence and sovereignty.29.	In the course of the past year and parallel to their efforts in their struggle in full independence and sovereignty  the African peoples have consolidated and developed their solidarity and have given each other encouragement and support. The Organization of African Unity has decided to consider the struggle to overthrow the racist regimes and apartheid and for the liberation of southern Africa as the task of all African countries and has determined to increase its support for the national liberation movements in that region. Thanks to that support the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania have been able to carry their just cause towards victory. The resolution of The Organization of African Unity against interference by wealthy great Powers in the affairs of the African continent"" does not  merely emphasize the determination of the African peoples to struggle against outside interference and to choose their own destiny; that resolution also shows that the countries of Africa are resolved to strengthen their solidarity where their common interests are concerned and to settle their problems among themselves without any outside interference. Furthermore  the success of the first summit Conference of Arab and African countries last March also ""advanced the struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  expansionism  Zionism  racism  and apartheid.30.	The political and moral support that the oppressed peoples  the peoples of the non-aligned countries and the third world give one another is a powerful source of mutual encouragement and has become a material force which bears down hard on all oppressors  interventionists  aggressors  and annexationists  inflicting on them defeat after defeat. Such solidarity is thus an imperative necessity and a sacred duty. It has been consolidated in the course of struggle for it is based on the principles of equality  mutual respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual support  non-interference in the domestic affairs of others and respect for the right of every people to decide the destiny of its country in full independence and sovereignty. Such solidarity among the peoples of countries with billions of inhabitants and with an ever keener political awareness  represents a prodigious force which no Power or manoeuvre can impede. In the future that force of solidarity based firmly on the principle of mutual respect and equality will be further strengthened.31.	The people of Kampuchea  who suffered from the war of aggression waged by the American imperialists and their lackeys  who carried on a stubborn fight for national liberation and who are at present struggling to defend and build their country in the new stage of their revolution  greatly appreciate the real value and effectiveness of the moral and political support of the struggling peoples  the non-aligned and third-world countries and the genuinely progressive countries of the world.32.	Democratic Kampuchea considers it to be its noble duty to show its solidarity with and give support to the just struggles of the exploited peoples and of the non-aligned and third-world countries for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  the right to decide their own destiny and to build an independent and prosperous economy and against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  expansionism  Zionism  racism  apartheid and all the forces of interference  aggression  expansion and annexation. Although we continue to face many problems following the devastating war waged by the American imperialists we are doing our best to show our solidarity and to give our moral and political support while standing firmly shoulder to shoulder with the peoples struggling for national liberation  independence  freedom  democracy and social progress.33.	First in Korea  the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the leadership of President Kim II Sung  representing the profound aspirations of the entire Korean people  has repeatedly put forward proposals for resolving the problem of Korea and reuniting Korea in full independence and sovereignty. But the Government of the United States of America obstinately continues its designs for aggression and interference in Korea  its policy of ""two Koreas"" and of maintaining its domination over the southern part of the country. Recently  while the South Korean puppets were stepping up their cruel and Fascist repression of the population  the United .States of America took various measures in South Korea to strengthen its military base and its neo-colonialist regime there in order to perpetuate the division of Korea. That is a further grave violation of General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX) and also a fundamental obstacle to the reunification of the Korean homeland. The United States of America should immediately withdraw from South Korea all its land  naval and air forces and all its military materiel  including nuclear weapons; it should cease its interference and intervention in and its aggression against Korea  abandon its policy of ""two Koreas""  dissolve the so-called ""United Nations Command"" and transform the ""Armistice Agreement"" into a definitive peace agreement. That is the only way the problem of Korea can be resolved in full independence and sovereignty without any foreign interference. The1 Government of Democratic Kampuchea wishes to reaffirm here its complete support for the position of President Kim 11 Sung and the proposals formulated by him for resolving the problem of the reunification of Korea.34.	Secondly  the United States of America continues its interference and intervention in the internal affairs of China. The People's Republic of China rightly insists on defending its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity. The liberation of Taiwan  which is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China  is a matter which falls entirely within the sovereignty of that country and must be resolved by the Chinese people themselves  without any foreign interference. The Government of Democratic Kampuchea unreservedly supports the position of the People's Republic of China and the manner in which that Republic is seeking to resolve the problem of Taiwan.35.	Thirdly  in southern Africa the barbarous and colonialist apartheid regime of Vorster and the racist and colonialist regime of Ian Smith have been severely shaken by the powerful struggles of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania. Those regimes would have crumbled long ago if the rich great Powers and their supporters had not given their political and material support  and carried out manoeuvres  to oppose the resolute struggle of the peoples. We offer our continuing resolute support to all peoples and countries of Africa  all the non-aligned countries and countries of the third world in their action against the treacherous manoeuvres of the wealthy great Powers and their supporters. We highly appreciate the firm resolve of the people of Zimbabwe to continue the people's war; counting mainly on their own forces to secure the country's independence. We highly commend the efforts of the people of Namibia to persist in the armed struggle for the independence and unity of Namibia. We also praise highly the widespread spontaneous movement of insurrection of the people of Azania to secure the right to determine their own destiny and to achieve the unity of their country. We once again express our firm solidarity with the just causes of all peoples in southern Africa.36.	Fourthly  in the Middle East the Palestine problem remains the key to the situation. The problem of peace cannot be resolved so long as the Palestinian people are unable to exercise their fundamental national rights. To attain this objective the heroic Palestinian people have carried on a long and valiant struggle. But the wealthy great Powers  which are competing for influence in the Middle East  have created many obstacles to the exercise of these sacred rights of the Palestinian people. The United States of America supports the Israeli Zionists in the pursuit of their policy of aggression  expansion and the settlement of colonies directed against the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples. It opposes the implementation of various United Nations resolutions recognizing the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people and demanding that Israel restore to the Arab countries territories conquered by force. We express our firm and constant support for the just and many-faceted struggle  particularly the armed struggle  of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  until the Palestinian people can exercise their national rights  and particularly the right to return to live in their own country  the right to decide their own destiny  and the right to create an independent Palestinian State on Palestinian land. We also reiterate our firm support for the struggle of other Arab peoples to free their territories. We are convinced that  through their persevering and resolute joint struggle  and with the support of the non-aligned and third-world peoples  the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples will be victorious in their just and sacred cause.37.	Fifthly  among the problems of decolonization  the problem of East Timor continues to concern countries which have known foreign domination and to confront the conscience of peoples that prize independence and justice. The aggressors continue to violate the independence  the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of East Timor. They continue to violate the principles of non-alignment and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council of the United Nations. We reaffirm our support for the struggle of the people of East Timor  carried on under the leadership of the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste lndependente  to recover its independence and the right to decide its own destiny. Our support rests on the principle that no country should use either the size of its territory or its population as a pretext for acts of aggression or annexation against the territories of other countries or attempt to absorb such territories. That is a position of principle. We do not believe that support for a small country with a small population like East Timor should come into conflict with self-interest and consequently suffer neglect. We consider the defence of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of East Timor as being the defence of the principle of respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries  great and small  that is stipulated in the United Nations Charter and that conforms to the principles of non-alignment. The defence of those principles is at the same time a condemnation of the law of the jungle practised by imperialists  colonialists  neo-colonialists and reactionaries of every kind  which  abusing their power and their strength  commit acts of aggression and annexation against small or weak countries  while claiming that they do no more than exercise their rights. We should defend these sacred principles against any attempt from the outside to mount acts of aggression against our countries and to swallow up our territories  and we must never allow such designs to be achieved.38.	Sixthly  the poor countries are still wrestling with numerous difficulties in their efforts to develop their independent economies. The reason is that the wealthy great Powers persist in defending the present international economic order  which is a regime of domination and exploitation  and throw the entire burden of their economic crisis upon the poor countries which they are endeavouring to keep in their place. The poor countries  closely united  have struggled actively to install a new international economic order based upon equality and justice. This struggle is an integral part of the struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and expansionism  and against ail acts of exploitation  oppression  interference and intervention. The countries of the third world are aware of the tremendous strength of their peoples and of their fertile creative genius that has built brilliant civilizations in the past. They also are aware of the abundance and the variety of their natural resources. From their own experience  the countries of the third world are understanding more and more clearly that they must look to their own peoples and strive to build up their economic   strength  their independence and sovereignty by themselves  and that it is only on that condition that they can secure greater strength for continuing the struggle and for imposing the new international economic order on the wealthy great Powers. The struggle will become still more arduous and complex. But the countries of the third world have accumulated more experience and victory will surely be theirs.39.	Seventhly  the poor countries have expressed solidarity with each other in their struggle to establish a new law of the sea. They have achieved tangible success in the defence of their sovereignty and of their maritime resources  and have broken the privilege of the wealthy great Powers in exercising exclusive control over the sea. The sea-bed in the international zone and the resources thereof are the heritage of all the peoples of the world. No country has a right to appropriate those resources unilaterally. The trend towards establishing the exclusive economic zone at 200 nautical miles has been affirmed in practice. But the large wealthy countries have attempted to prevent the establishment of the new law of the sea with the aim of preserving their privilege of exploiting the sea-bed for their own selfish interests. They have not hesitated to use technical and financial pressure  and have resorted to manoeuvres in order to control the so-called ""international authority"" that is to be set up  with a view to reducing the role played by the countries of the third world. On this question of the sea-bed  Democratic Kampuchea  as ever  associates itself firmly with all the countries of the third world in pursuing the joint struggle for a new law of the sea that will be in the common interest of all the peoples of the world.40.	Eighthly  thanks to the common struggle of the non- aligned countries and the countries of the third world  the United Nations General Assembly has adopted pertinent resolutions on some important world problems. But those resolutions have remained a dead letter because of the abuse of the veto power by the large wealthy countries in the pursuit of their own interests. Furthermore  while competing for influence and with each other in continuing the sophisticated arms race and the sale of arms all over the world—a source of continuing tension in various parts of the world—these large wealthy Powers use the rostrum of the United Nations to dupe the peoples  to lull their vigilance  in order the better to subjugate them. At the same time  they are endeavouring to stem the tide of the national liberation struggle of peoples all over the world. This tends to reduce still further the role played by the United Nations. With all the non-aligned and third world countries  we continue to demand the urgent revision of the United Nations Charter so that the United Nations may be enabled to play its role in conformity with the realities of today's world  which is undergoing profound change. Decisions on major world issues should not be the exclusive reserve of the wealthy great Powers. All States  great or small  must have the same rights in deciding international affairs.41.	The movements of revolutionary struggle and national liberation  the struggle for the defence of independence sovereignty and territorial integrity and the right to decide one's own destiny have greatly encouraged the people of Kampuchea in their present efforts to complete the work of national defence and construction in the course of the new state of its revolution.42.	The people of Kampuchea wish to live in peace  with dignity and honour  as masters of their own country  and to build a society in conformity with their deepest aspirations  to follow a road which they have themselves chosen  in full independence and sovereignty. Those are the basic principles to which they are firmly committed. But in the past  for centuries  our country was reduced to the most abject slavery. Our country   which was subject to exploitation and domination by foreign feudal and reactionary circles  by colonialists and imperialists  lost much of its territory. Its present frontiers are the unhappy result of endless acts of aggression  expansion and annexation by foreign Powers. Since 17 April 1975  the date of the total and final liberation of Kampuchea  our people has become the true master of its country and of its own destiny. It is inspired by a burning and just patriotism. Despite its painful past history  it has no wish to open old wounds; it is looking to the present and to the future. We have no enmity; we have no designs against other countries for aggression  expansion or annexation. We covet not a single inch of anyone else's territory. Our country is small; our population is small; our geographical situation and our political regime in no way predispose us to commit acts of aggression against other countries. Small weak countries do not swallow large countries. In world history only the reactionary ruling classes in large countries  like Hitler  invent pretexts for provoking small countries  accusing them of aggression and using such pretexts for committing acts of aggression against the small countries  and increasing their own territory at the expense of the latter. Democratic Kampuchea has no motive which might impel it to acts of aggression against others. Its territory is some 181 000 square kilometres and comprises about 6 million hectares of rice paddies and fields. Its great lakes  its rivers  including the Tonle Sap  the Mekong and the Bassac  its ponds and other water courses are abundantly stocked with fish. Its forests  its soil  its subsoil and its sea abound in natural resources. And yet we have scarcely 8 million inhabitants. Each peasant family has an average of five hectares of cultivable land. Thus we have had no reason to extend our territory at the expense of others. On the other hand  our country has just emerged from a devastating war. We need time  and we must mobilize all our forces to build up our own country and effect a rapid improvement in the living standards of our people.43.	Respect for our independence  our sovereignty and territorial integrity is an imperative for us. We have always endeavoured to establish close and friendly relations with all countries  near and far  throughout the world. This can be seen from the visits by our delegations to various countries in 1975  immediately following the liberation of our country. We have always scrupulously respected the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. But we are firmly resolved to defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of our own country. Our people has now become master of the destiny of its country  having waged a valiant struggle  endured all kinds of difficulties  and having vanquished theAmerican imperialists and their lackeys on 17 April 1975. Our people will never allow anyone to commit acts of violation  aggression  interference  subversion or provocation  or to change its frontiers. Because they are just  these positions of cur people meet with the approval and support of our friends near and far on five continents. But our enemies of all kinds are seeking by every means possible to destroy Democratic Kampuchea. The question which arises is whether  with so small a population  Democratic Kampuchea can ensure the defence of its own territory. At present our people  which has a firm hold on revolutionary power  is fully and absolutely capable of ensuring that defence  because we are strengthened by our experience gained in the course of the war of national liberation against a most cruel war of aggression waged by the American imperialists  experience which enabled our people to win the great victory of 17 April 1975  in full independence and sovereignty and counting mainly on our own strength  with the support of peoples near and far.44.	More than two years have elapsed since then  and despite many post-war problems which still remain to be solved  our people and our Revolutionary Army-alerted to the true nature of the aggressive and annexationist  cruel and treacherous American imperialists and of their lackeys and reactionaries  who are the enemies of our people to be found on every hand  now constantly on the revolutionary alert-have shattered all their attempts at aggression  expansion  subversion and provocation  fully succeeding in the defence  consolidation and development of the achievements of the revolution and of revolutionary power  as well as safeguarding the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and frontiers of their own country in full independence and sovereignty  and relying entirely on their own strength.45.	All these victories have created new conditions  enabling us to complete the work of national defence and to work even more successfully towards building up the country.46.	We should like formally to proclaim once again here that Democratic Kampuchea will provoke no other country and will adhere resolutely and unshakeably to the principles of mutual respect for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and equality.47.	Security is complete throughout our country. Foreign guests can travel by day or night in perfect safety for hundreds and thousands of kilometres. Our national defence is thus far perfectly sound  but we must redouble our revolutionary vigilance to remain masters of the situation in case of attempts at provocation and aggression on the part of the enemy.48.	In both the building up of our country and in safeguarding the gains of the revolution and the national defence  we still cling to our position of independence and sovereignty  and we still rely on our own strength. This position which the people of Kampuchea has won  thanks to the constant education of the Communist Party of Kampuchea  has been tried and tested at all stages of the revolutionary movement and has won a succession of brilliant victories for the people of Kampuchea.49.	During the more than five years of the war of national liberation  from 1970 to 1975  the people of Kampuchea and the Revolutionary Army displayed sublime heroism  endured difficulties of every kind and made immense sacrifices in order to secure control of their own country's destiny  and they carried on the war of national liberation  in full independence and sovereignty: independence and sovereignty in understanding the situation in the country and the revolution  for no one knows his own country better than himself; independence and sovereignty in formulating and applying the strategic line and the tactical line of struggle; independence and sovereignty in building up one's strength in every sphere-the strength of the leadership  the strength of the people  military strength  economic strength and so forth.50.	In 1973  at a time when the international situation was complex and hardly as favourable to us as it is now  when the United States imperialists were mobilizing all their strategic and tactical air forces in Asia and in the Pacific solely to attack and to bombard Kampuchea so as to destroy at a blow our country and our revolution  our people and our Revolutionary Army resolved to defend our national dignity and to take a firm hold on their own destiny and the destiny of their country. Not disheartened in the face of any difficulty or sacrifice  they resolutely carried on the struggle and launched offensives without respite for five years and one month until they achieved a glorious victory which was total and definitive.51.	The valuable experience acquired in the course of the war for national liberation has strengthened our faith in the path of independence and sovereignty and in reliance on our own strength.52.	The results obtained by our people and our Revolutionary Army during the nearly two years since 17 April 1975 have once again clearly confirmed that this policy of struggle is the key factor in all our victories.53.	In the work of national construction  we are not disregarding the true state of affairs of our country  which is a backward agricultural country destroyed by a war of aggression and devastation. We firmly rely on the exalted revolutionary awareness  the tremendous strength  the experience arid creative spirit of our people  the vast majority of whom are peasants. We take agriculture as the fundamental factor  and we make use of the capital accumulated by agriculture in order progressively to build up industry and to transform Kampuchea  which had had a backward agriculture  within a short period of time into a modern agricultural country and then into an industrial country  while firmly keeping to the path of independence and sovereignty and drawing fundamentally on our own strength.54.	With respect to agriculture  we are giving priority to solving the problem of water  which is the key factor in obtaining the maximum yield in the production of rice  which is our basic food crop. During the last dry season  in every zone  we completed the construction of large reservoirs with a capacity of from 100 million to 200 million cubic metres each  in each region that of medium- sized reservoirs each containing 50 million to 60 million cubic metres of water  and in each district that of small reservoirs containing 5 million to 10 million cubic metres of water each  totalling altogether 2 800 million cubic metres of water. We also dug several hundred kilometres of canals leading from those reservoirs  making it possible to irrigate 250 000 hectares of rice paddies in every season. Simultaneously  we completed the construction of five dams on the Prek Thnot river serving 60 000 hectares of rice paddies  two dams on the Chinit river serving 20 000 hectares of rice paddies  three dams on the Pursat river serving 30 000 hectares of rice paddies  and a dam on the Battambang river serving 40 000 hectares of rice paddies. .We have also constructed dams on the Siemreap and Kralanh rivers and on a number of smaller rivers. All this work was done by our workers and peasants  who depend entirely on their own strength. Simultaneously  the production of natural fertilizers and insecticides  using the raw materials and plants that are amply available in our country  has been carried on by a spontaneous mass movement. The widespread organization of co-operatives  in which the peasants hold power and control production  constitutes the fundamental factor that is constantly changing the appearance of the countryside of Kampuchea and transforming it. In 1976  we reached the planned targets for the production of rice  which made it possible for us to meet the needs of the population and provide an average of 312 kilograms per year for each person in 1977 and to begin in 1977 the exportation of several tens of thousands tons of rice  which  together with rubber and other agricultural products  is designed to secure capital for the defence and the construction of our country.55.	The orientation of our industry is also based on the practical state of affairs in our country. We are concentrating on factories that serve the development of agricultural production and the improvement of the living conditions of the population. 'We are not diversifying beyond what is necessary. In conformity with this policy  we are concentrating our efforts on the construction of new factories and on repairing and transforming factories that depended on foreign supplies of raw materials  in order to enable them to use the country's own primary commodities. Parallel ""with industry  we are developing artisan activities at the level of both individual and regional production units so as to stimulate economic development.56.	In the field of culture and education  our policy is to study the task of national defence and construction while we put our studies into practice. Theory is related to practice and to work and production. Our schools exist mainly at the level of co-operatives and factories. Our education rests on a popular and national base  from which we are speeding up the development of technology and the  sciences. In the immediate future  our main objective is the elimination of illiteracy in the old society  there were certainly schools and high schools and a certain number of universities  but in the countryside 75 per cent of the people  particularly the poor and marginal peasants  were illiterate  and even in the cities 60 per cent of the workers were illiterate. At present  just two years after liberation  only 10 per cent of the population can neither read nor write and these are all persons already advanced in age. We have solved the problem of illiteracy by resorting to a mass movement of study. The former system of education was no more than a copy of a foreign system alien to our national situation. It was useful neither for national defence nor for national construction  nor did it serve to improve the living conditions of the population  and it was indefinitely dependent upon foreign aid. Now  in order to serve at the same time the tasks of national defence and construction  our educational programmes are concentrated on technology. Theoretical and practical studies are carried on simultaneously. We are studying  at one and the same time  technology  general culture and theory  in particular the technology of agriculture in the fields of rice and rubber growing  various industrial techniques and the development of water resources. We observe that the present orientation of our teaching and education admirably serves the purposes of defence and national construction and the improvement in the standards of living of' our people. Furthermore  thanks to this orientation  our children  our young people  our workers  our peasants and our fighters are being educated in the most authentic and most ardent revolutionary patriotism. They feel concerned at the fate of poor peoples throughout the world and they understand the distinction between friends and enemies in the revolutionary struggle and in the national liberation movement of peoples throughout the world. They stand resolutely side by side with the revolutionary peoples of the world.57.	.In the social and health fields  in order rapidly to improve the health of the entire population  we are training revolutionary doctors  who are moved by a deep love for the people and by a lofty spirit of self-sacrifice  and we are producing medicines from the herbs growing in the country. In their training  our revolutionary doctors combine theoretical studies and practice  and they increase their knowledge at the same time. We have developed and are developing health networks by creating hospital establishments and centres for the manufacture of medicines in all co-operatives  districts  regions and administrative zones and in the capital Phnom Penh. There is an average of one general hospital  three attending physicians  one factory for the production of medicines and three pharmacists for every 100 families. The health of our people has shown considerable improvement. We have definitively eliminated social diseases and drug addiction. We are paying particular attention to the eradication of malaria. In die past year  the first year of the four-year plan for the eradication of malaria  70 to 80 per cent of the plan targets has already been achieved. We are endeavouring very rapidly to improve the living conditions and the health of our people because we need a population of 15 to 20 million in 10 years' time. Vice  delinquency  prostitution  theft  robbery  banditry and other social evils of the kind that exist in the imperialist countries and in an exploitive class society have been rooted out by the great mass movement.58.	Over and above the results I have just mentioned  the line of independence  sovereignty and self-reliance  and a sense of being masters of the country and of the revolution have deeply pervaded our people and have aroused throughout the country a spontaneous and enthusiastic mass movement deeply imbued with an ardent spirit of patriotism and of a lofty community feeling which is of profound revolutionary significance. This is a movement which has never before been known in the more than 2 000-year history of our nation.59.	The results achieved by our people in the past year  under the just and far-sighted leadership of the CommunistParty of Kampuchea  represent new and very rapid victories in the present stage of our revolution.60.	But with regard to the long-term aspirations of our people  the road that we have yet to travel is long indeed. We must redouble our efforts. We are endeavouring as rapidly as possible to improve still further the living conditions of our people  so that everyone may have sufficient strength and health and ardent patriotism  so that our entire people may rapidly and constantly progress and that we may continue in the defence and speedy construction of a prosperous Kampuchea. We have no reason to reduce the size of our population or to maintain it at its present level for  with close to 8 million inhabitants  our population is still far short of our country's capacity  which has a need of more than 20 million people. This is why our objective is to bring about a very rapid increase in our population.61.	Although our people do not yet live in affluence  their living conditions are assured for each and in all spheres. By comparison with the situation in 1975  as we emerged from the cruel war of devastation  the present situation does show considerable improvement. Our people are very happy and are proud of this excellent state of affairs where they are truly the masters of their own destiny and of their own country. Our population now consists of 95 per cent workers and peasants and 5 per cent persons engaged in other tasks. Closely united under the just and far-sighted leadership of the Communist Party of Kampuchea  our people live and work in perfect harmony  in a healthy society where equality  justice and genuine democracy prevail. Masters of the revolution and enjoying all its benefits  our people continue with enthusiasm  faith and confidence to continue the revolution. Our people are resolved to safeguard and defend  to consolidate and incessantly to strengthen its revolutionary power. The victory of the policy of independence  sovereignty and self-reliance has strengthened our people's faith in the country's radiant future. Without the support  union  unity and the faith of the entire people  the present spontaneous movement for national defence and construction would be unthinkable and Democratic Kampuchea would have been unable to win such brilliant victories. The strength of this union  this unity and this faith is the key factor in our present victories  as it was in our great victory of 17 April 1975 over the United States imperialists.62.	Many friendly peoples and countries have welcomed these achievements of Democratic Kampuchea and have expressed to us their sympathy and encouragement and their moral and political support. Some friendly countries have given us bilateral assistance. We are happy to receive this assistance without strings which  granted on the basis of the principle of equality and genuine mutual respect  further strengthens our independence and sovereignty. This is evidence of the sincere solidarity among the non-aligned and third-world countries. But our country is now already liberated and our people are amply capable of defending themselves and of building the country using their own strength. We believe that peoples that are shedding blood in the struggle for national liberation are in greater need of support and additional assistance in order to secure the triumph of their just cause. This does not mean that we are living in abundance. But we must persevere further in our efforts  we must overcome other obstacles to resolve the post-war problems  to defend and build the country by ourselves  in order not to be the subject of concern to friendly countries. We should endeavour to advance the revolution in our own country and to win great new victories. We should try to contribute still further to the revolutionary struggle and to the national liberation struggle and the struggle for national defence carried on by peoples all over the world.63.	Democratic Kampuchea considers the sympathy  encouragement and various tokens of the solidarity of the non-aligned and third-world countries and of genuinely progressive countries as a precious support for its policy of independence  peace and non-alignment. We shall always abide by that policy. Never shall we allow any foreign country to establish military bases on our territory. Never shall we tolerate the presence of foreign troops on our soil. In the past we have from time to time been asked to join this or that federation or regional association. Democratic Kampuchea belongs to no alliance and no regional group. But we do endeavour to develop with all countries  near and far  bilateral relations of friendship  based on equality and mutual respect. This position has met with the sympathy and understanding of many countries with which we maintain good and friendly relations.64.	Our people are convinced that their efforts to carry through the revolution in its country  effectively to defend and solidly to build our homeland and rapidly to improve our living conditions on the basis of independence  sovereignty and self-reliance represent a modest contribution to the revolutionary struggle of peoples in the world  to the national liberation struggle of peoples of exploited countries and to the struggle to safeguard and defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the non-aligned and third-world countries. The experience of our own revolutionary struggle and the struggles of peoples throughout the world have taught us that  if we wish to make a positive contribution to the world-wide revolutionary struggle  we must resolutely carry the revolution in our own country to a successful conclusion. Revolution cannot be exported or imported from one country to another. That is why our people are bending every effort to complete the revolution in their own country  in complete independence and sovereignty  relying on their own strength so that they can better contribute to the revolutionary movements and the fighting movements of the world's peoples.65.	The peoples of the exploited countries  the peoples of the non-aligned and third-world countries  have acquired an ever keener political awareness and ever more confidence in their own strength and capacities; they see ever clearer the true nature and manoeuvres of imperialism and expansionism and their supporters  and they endeavour valiantly to continue the struggle as masters of their own destiny. At the same time  they continue to develop and strengthen their solidarity by foiling the divisive manoeuvres carried out by all the imperialist and expansionist powers. This historic current will develop incessantly for ever; no force can halt it. The revolutionary and progressive peoples throughout the world will surely win further victories. In the past  as at present and in the future  Democratic Kampuchea will continue to identify itself with those struggles and do everything within its power to give further momentum to this irresistible tide of history.

"71",3863,"KWT",32,1977,"﻿194.	It gives me great pleasure to express to the President  on behalf of Kuwait  heartfelt congratulations on his unanimous election to his high office in the General Assembly. His election attests to the General Assembly's confidence in him  which is not only a recognition of his exceptional qualities but also a token of the appreciation of the international community of the role Yugoslavia has played in international affairs as a member of the non- aligned group and the Group of 77. It is a source of great pleasure to see presiding over our deliberations a man with vast experience in United Nations work who has contributed a great deal to the upholding of the purposes and principles of the Charter.195.	I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka  for the able manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the thirty-first session of the Genera! Assembly.196.	Kuwait prizes the efforts 02 the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for the maintenance of world stability and order. We support the quiet diplomacy and his call for the utilization of His good offices for the containment of existing tensions in many areas.197.	Kuwait has consistently advocated respect for the principle of the universality of the United Nations  which should make the world Organization a real microcosm of international society. In this respect I should like to congratulate the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on its admission to the United Nations  which had been for some time overdue. Our sincere congratulations go also to the Republic of Djibouti  a new member of the League of Arab States  which is now ready to discharge the responsibilities of statehood and to participate actively in regional and international organizations.198.	The Government of Kuwait welcomed detente as a major step heralding a new era in international affairs  an era in which the relations between the big Powers would move from confrontation to negotiation. It was our hope that the law of co-operation would eventually supplant the law of coexistence as the predominant body of norms. However  we may have been over-optimistic  since the entire concept of detent has not yet taken a concrete form but continues to vacillate in a manner that frequently leads to disillusionment. We should like to voice our ardent hope that detente may ultimately take deep roots and be followed by a variety of measures leading to the elimination of international tension and the strengthening of international peace and security. We should like also to reaffirm our firm belief that detente should in no way be used as a means of consolidating big-power hegemony in international affairs or of dividing the world into spheres of influence. The primary need of the international community is to abolish political aggression and to create conditions favourable to the advance of the developing countries on the path of progress.199.	Kuwait attaches great importance to the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament because there is a close link between security and development  a conclusion inherent in the recognition of the fact that peace and prosperity are indivisible. Disarmament and development are both tasks of utmost urgency which have to be pursued simultaneously and vigorously. Substantial progress in the field of disarmament will constitute an important element in the search for a more equitable international economic order. The continued diversion of the world's scarce material find human resources to military ends is seriously threatening the attainment of the goals of development. What the world needs is not guns but better standards of living and the eradication of the evils of poverty  illiteracy and disease.S98. The dialogue last year in Paris between the North and the South proved beyond doubt the existence- of a wide gap between theory and practice  promises and performance. It is regrettable that the developed countries have not shown the necessary political will to make the structural changes required in the international economic system or to adopt the measures needed for prompt action on urgent problems. The resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly exposed the overbearing attitude of the developed countries and their reluctance to fulfil their commitments. We call upon the developed countries to reconsider their position on the unresolved issues and to continue the dialogue in a constructive spirit.199.	Technical co-operation has come to represent a necessary instrument for the development process in various fields since it is not possible to formulate and implement development plans in one country without taking into consideration the advances made and the experience gained in others. In the industrial field the developing countries are heavily dependent for new technologies on a few large transnational corporations  which impose harsh conditions for the transfer of technology  conditions which constitute an excessive burden on the limited resources of the developing countries.200.	Kuwait had the privilege during the last few months to act as host to two important meetings concerned with technical co-operation  namely  the ECWA regional meeting on technical co-operation among developing countries and the panel of consultants which issued the Kuwait Declaration on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries. One can never overestimate the importance of technology in creating the world order under which some privileged groups in the international community live today. Economic progress cannot be envisaged for the less fortunate in the absence of technical innovation adapted to their needs.201.	Kuwait is keenly alive to its role as a donor of aid and an active participant in promoting technical cooperation among developing countries  and has been cooperating actively with national  regional and international institutions to this end.202.	More than two thirds of the people of the developing countries depend directly on agriculture for survival.Agriculture provides those countries with their main dependable defence against future famines and their primary means of overcoming the current evils of malnutrition and under nourishment. Systematic  sustained action to stimulate agriculture in the developing countries is a compelling necessity  not just to prevent hunger  but also to inject dynamism into the whole process of economic and social development. The establishment of an International Fund for Agricultural Development is a positive step in this direction  I should like to take this opportunity to express the hope that the instruments of the Fund will be ratified at an early date so it may soon become operational.203.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has become a permanent phenomenon in international society. If the preparatory work in the sea-bed Committee is taken into consideration  the Conference will have been in constant session for a whole decade. The results  however  have been so far disappointing. The coastal States have shown little regard for the interests and needs of the geographically disadvantaged States. The developed countries are still seeking to impose their joint dominion on the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction rather than let mankind as a whole exploit the resources of the area for its benefit. The atmosphere of the Conference has been clouded by the unilateral declarations of coastal States and threats of unilateral action by developed countries  which ignore the fact that conventions are still the main instrument of international legislation. States therefore must negotiate in good faith and decisions must be made in an atmosphere of freedom. The eventual convention will be ineffective  unless all States agree to become parties to it. In the final analysis  the Conference on the Law of the Sea is a major test of the present state of international relations  one which will decide whether the rule of law should prevail or whether the world will be dominated by those who monopolize political power  technology and managerial skill.204.	The situation in Africa still poses a threat to international peace and security. The situation in Rhodesia is very dangerous. Notwithstanding the commendable efforts made by the United Kingdom and the United States to put an end to the rebellion of the white minority in Rhodesia  that minority continues to monopolize government power and responsibility against the will of the preponderant African majority and its right to self-determination and independence. The principle of acceding to the wishes of the majority in Rhodesia on the basis of the right of every citizen to express his views is sacred and inalienable. Kuwait has always supported the just struggle of the people of Zimbabwe to abolish the illegal minority regime and to replace it with democratic majority rule. The intransigence of the white rebels kindled the flames of resistance  personified in the liberation organizations  after the people of Zimbabwe realized that the only means of escaping from the rule of the illegal minority was through resort to armed struggle.205.	Tension in Namibia also continues  owing to the refusal of the Government of South Africa to recognize the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination.206.	South Africa's attempts to fragment Namibia have increased the intensity of the armed struggle for independence and the preservation of the territorial integrity of Namibia. The presence of South Africa in Namibia  in spite of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the decision of the International Court of Justice  and its attempts to annex parts of Namibia pose a threat to international peace and security and constitute a flagrant defiance of the United Nations Charter. Kuwait has consistently supported the imposition of economic and military sanctions against South Africa  in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.207.	The situation in South Africa is a menace to peace  not only in that region but in the world as a whole  owing to the inhuman policy of apartheid  that seeks to subject the African majority to the will of a tyrannical white minority  which practices a policy of suppression.208.	The recent events in South Africa  reflected in the demonstrations expressing the indignation of the majority over the policy of apartheid  places a heavy responsibility on the United Nations to take the necessary steps to put an end to this policy  which is inimical to basic human rights.209.	The policy of dividing South Africa into bantustans in the guise of self-determination is unacceptable  since its aim is to perpetuate power in the hands of the white minority  and to monopolize the sources of wealth in South Africa.210.	I should like to mention the reports according to which South Africa may be planning to conduct a nuclear test in Namibia. These plans will aggravate tension in the region  and will induce the African countries to take security measures to protect themselves against this violent danger.211.	The Conferences held in Lagos and Maputo regarding the situation in southern Africa had a considerable effect in drawing the attention of the international community to the nature of the grave situation which prevails in that part of Africa. I should like to mention in this context that Kuwait  which attended both Conferences  contributed $ 1 million to the liberation movements in Africa  actuated by its belief that rights cannot be attained except through armed struggle.2).2. Of all the regions of the world  the Middle East has for the past 30 years been in an abnormal situation which has made it a cause of special international concern  not only because it may explode at any moment  but because it can lead the international community to a nuclear war  which would destroy the whole world. That region has been the scene of four wars during the past 30 years; the elements of war in it are still stronger than the elements of stability.213. More than 10 years have elapsed since Israel launched its aggression against Egypt  Syria and Jordan  and 30 years have passed since it extorted from the people of Palestine their lands and homeland for the purpose of replacing thePalestinians with Jewish settlers from all parts of the world. Israel still occupies the Sinai peninsula  the West Bank of Jordan  Gaza and the Golan Heights and refuses to withdraw from ail these territories  which have been under its occupation since 1967.214.	The United Nations has made great efforts to establish a just peace in the area; its efforts  however  have not yielded any positive results. On the contrary  Israel has formally informed the United Nations that it will not withdraw to the 1967 frontiers. Israel has established Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories to create a fait accompli  in violation of the Charter  which proscribes the acquisition of territory by force  and in defiance of United Nations resolutions  which provide for complete withdrawal from these territories. Nevertheless  Israel  which flours the resolutions of the United Nations and ignores its Charter  still finds sympathizers and supporters who protect it against the indignation of the international community  expressed in innumerable resolutions. Thus  the Middle East will remain a severe test for the international Organization  to whose Charter allegiance has been sworn by all States.215.	The Middle East is a good example of the gap between words and deeds. No region has subjected the United Nations to a more severe test as to whether it would implement its resolutions  or would neglect them and relegate them to oblivion. The United Nations has adopted many resolutions calling upon Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  thus putting all its political and moral weight against Israel. The United Nations has not  however  translated these resolutions into practical steps which would deter Israel and put an end to its defiance of the international community  and it has therefore lost a great deal of its prestige and efficacy. It is a cause of regret that some Member States  who were given special powers by the Charter to protect that Charter  defend Israel and object to the imposition of measures against it. This has deprived the international Organization of its political importance  especially in the Middle East  whose peoples have lost their faith in the United Nations and its capacity to implement its resolutions and enforce its Charter.216.	The people of Palestine were expelled from their lands  homelands and possessions and driven to refugee camps to live on international charity  contrary to the resolutions of the United Nations  which defined their right to self-determination and called for the establishment of a homeland in their own country. Yet Israel seized their lands and possessions  and transformed the Arab minority which remained in Palestine into second-rate citizens  and deprived the majority of their right to return to their homeland despite United Nations resolutions. Nevertheless  Israel is still a member of the international Organization  although it had pledged  at the time of its admission  to implement all United Nations resolutions.217.	The United Nations has adopted a resolution which stated that negotiations for a just peace settlement in the area could not take place in the absence of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the lawful representative of the people of Palestine  which should take part on a footing of equality with all other parties.218.	One of the main reasons for the delay in convening the Geneva Conference has been the refusal of Israel to allow the Palestine Liberation Organization to participate  in spite of the resolutions of the United Nations  which explicitly provide for the representation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the negotiations. Israel should fully realize that there is no alternative to the participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the peace negotiations. Peace will not be established in the Middle East unless the people of Palestine exercise their right to self-determination and an independent Palestine is established for them. Likewise  peace will not be restored to the area unless Israel withdraws from all occupied Arab territories. This matter is not negotiable  as it stems from United Nations resolutions as well as the principles and purposes of the Charter. This position has already been endorsed by a majority of States  whether in the non- aligned group  the Islamic countries  or within the framework of the United Nations  including the nine members of the European Economic Community which  in their recent statement  supported these fundamental principles. Mr. Carter  the President of the United States  has repeatedly proclaimed that it is necessary to establish a homeland for the Palestinians  and reaffirmed the need for Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories. The Nordic countries have also supported this position in their recent statement in Helsinki.219.	The clouds of war are ominously gathering over the skies of the Middle East more than at any other time in the past. Israel's present policy is a prescription for war and is devoid of any real desire for peace since Israel refuses to withdraw from occupied Arab territories and objects to the representation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the negotiations for a just settlement. Israel opposes the establishment of an independent Palestinian State in Palestine. It also rejects the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In addition  Israel has established settlements for Jewish settlers in occupied Arab territories. The number of those settlements there has already exceeded 80. Israel persisted in its defiance of the international Organization and of the States that still support it by recently proclaiming the legalization of three Israeli settlements and authorizing the establishment of additional settlements.220.	Israel's defiance of the whole world culminated in the declaration by the Minister in charge of Jewish settlements  General Sharon  to the effect that he had prepared a plan for the settlement of tens of thousands of immigrants in the occupied Arab territories and that a network of roads would be built to connect those settlements with Israeli cities. His plan calls for the importation of 2 million Jews to settle on Arab territories by the end of this century. The Israeli Government also took a decision to grant Palestinians under occupation a special status as a prelude to the annexation of their territories.221.	The policy of the annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan and of Gaza that was formulated 10 years ago is part of an expansionist Israeli plan to occupy the whole of Palestine and the territories surrounding it and to destroy the entity of the people of Palestine as a nation eager to exercise its right of self-determination. Israel's ""peace- loving"" statements are no more than a hoax designed to mislead world public opinion.222.	The situation in the Middle East is extremely grave. In the light of those violations of United Nations and the provisions of its Charter  the Organization has no alternative but to translate the indignation and wrath of the international community into effective action against Israel  not merely by condemning its policy that will inevitably lead to war  but by adopting punitive measures in conformity with Chapter VII of the Charter  which impose political  economic  trade and military sanctions  as in the case of Rhodesia  in order to preserve the prestige and efficacy of the Organization and to protect the Charter and its purposes.223.	The Arab countries have had enough of the policy of procrastination and delaying tactics at a time when Israel is annexing the remaining parts of the West Bank  Gaza and other occupied Arab territories. It is imperative to emphasize that the Middle East region is moving in the direction of war  a fact that. portends grave consequences for the whole world. The Arab countries and the Palestinian people have no alternative but to resort to force and to proclaim their rejection of Israeli policy and their resistance to the policy of creating settlements and annexing territories.224.	Whatever may be the inadequacies of the United Nations system—and they are legion—that system represents the only realistic point of departure for the sustained efforts of succeeding generations through which mankind can equip itself with the political institutions without which there can be no peace or freedom. Crisis management  however sophisticated  is no substitute for organized work towards real peace. The whole future of mankind now depends on matching the actions of Governments and the organization of society with the contemporary progress of science and technology. The United Nations has now been in existence longer than the effective life of the League of Nations and has to its credit a substantially far more impressive record of accomplishments. It has displayed a vitality and an adaptability to changing circumstances that augur well for the future. It has greatly enlarged the scope and range of international activities and achieved a directness of impact that is a great advance. But in matters of the first importance  the United Nations continues to be crippled by some of the limitations that destroyed the League. We must conceive of the United Nations as a universal community in which the obligations of membership and the policies of Members are not contradictory. We must make its services so indispensable to its Members and so build up its prestige and authority that it becomes for the world at large what the community in which the citizen is born has become for him.

"72",3908,"LAO",32,1977,"﻿47.	  On behalf of theLao People's Democratic Republic  I am pleased to extend my warmest greetings to all representatives present here.48.	I should like to congratulate Mr. Lazar Mojsov  Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  on his unanimous election to the post of President of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am convinced that through our united efforts the work of this Assembly session will yield positive results.49.	I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate also Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim  who was accorded a second term of office by the Assembly at its previous session. It will be my great pleasure to contribute our support and co-operation to the smooth running of our international Organization.50.	I should particularly like to address our greetings and sincere congratulations to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  a country blessed with strong traditions of struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism in the pursuit of peace  national independence  friendship and international co-operation  which has just recovered its legitimate right to United Nations membership. The admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations is a victory for the Vietnamese people  for the peoples of the world and for the United Nations itself.51.	I also wish to welcome the admission to our international Organization of the Republic of Djibouti.52.	In one year  great changes have occurred in the international situation. Thanks to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution  the sixtieth anniversary of which will soon be celebrated  the socialism which was born in a single country and which became a world-wide system after the Second World War  has spread and has been continuously consolidated in all fields. After the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held in Colombo in 1976  those countries strengthened their solidarity with the struggle against imperialism for the establishment of a new international economic order. The national liberation movements in Asia  Africa and Latin America  greatly encouraged by the victories in the struggle for national salvation of the peoples of Viet Nam  Democratic Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic against their imperialist aggressors  are swelling further  developing vigorously and winning new victories. In the capitalist countries the class struggle of the workers for democratic freedoms and a better life is daily increasing its scope. Faced with this situation  the imperialists have reacted in a variety of pernicious ways  resorting to fallacious propaganda  to division  to the policy of peaceful evolution and to tactics of intimidation  intervention and aggression aimed at checking the revolution and impeding progress. But they can in no way stem the tide of history. The balance of forces in the world is continuing to tip in favour of the forces of peace  national independence  democracy and social progress.53.	I am pleased to note that during the past 12 months the Lao People's Democratic Republic  relying on its own strength and benefiting from the support of the United Nations and of friendly countries around the world  has worked tirelessly for national defence and construction.54.	We are fully aware that constructing a new way of life is one of the most difficult  complex and time-consuming tasks. Moreover  we must constantly deal with attempts to undermine us on the part of enemies of the new regime. Nevertheless  while developing the sovereign rights of the Lao people and strengthening its attachment to the new regime  we have been able to achieve significant success in maintaining security and order throughout the country  binding the wounds of war and eliminating the harmful vestiges of the former regime  as well as in restoring the economy  developing our culture and improving the life of the people. We have thus made an active contribution to the defence of peace and the strengthening of friendship and international co-operation. Those are signs of our commitment to peace  independence  friendship  international co-operation and well-being.55.	I wish to take this opportunity to voice my deep gratitude to the United Nations  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  Democratic Kampuchea  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries  the non-aligned nations  friendly countries and international organizations and peoples throughout the world which prize  peace and justice  including the progressive American people  and which  by their aid and support for the Lao People's Democratic Republic  contributed to the victory of the Laotian people.56.	Since its foundation two years ago  the Lao People's Democratic Republic has actively pursued a policy of peace  independence  friendship and non-alignment. From this rostrum I wish once again to reaffirm our position. The Lao People's Democratic Republic is continuing to strengthen its special relations of good-neighbourliness with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and with Democratic Kampuchea on the basis of long-standing traditions of friendship and of mutual respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  in a spirit of fraternal co-operation and for our reciprocal advantage.57.	We are convinced that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will make an active contribution to the work of the United Nations for the achievement of its objectives.58.	We are convinced also that the international community  too  will make its contribution  in aid and support of all kinds to the reconstruction of Viet Nam  which for decades has suffered so much from the devastating war. of aggression.59.	In this regard  we believe that the United States will not fail in its commitment to help to bind up the wounds of war and to assist in Viet Nam's post-war reconstruction.60.	We are committed to the further strengthening of solidarity and friendship with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  with the People's Republic of China and with other socialist countries  while stepping up reciprocal aid and mutually advantageous co-operation.61.	We shall continue to strengthen our solidarity with the non-aligned countries in the defence of national independence and the sovereign right of every country over its natural wealth  and for a new international economic order.62.	We stand for the strengthening of peace and the development of relations between countries having different political systems  on the basis of strict respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  of non-interference in others' domestic affairs  of equality and of mutual advantage  and for fruitful international cooperation.63.	As a country of South-East. Asia we steadily pursue the policy of developing friendly relations and co-operation of various kinds with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty  territorial integrity  equality and mutual advantage  and of not allowing any foreign country to use one's territory as a base for aggression and direct or indirect intervention directed against another country. We are opposed to the presence of the bases and troops of imperialist aggression in this part of the world. At the same time  we energetically support the struggle for the national independence  peace  democracy and true neutrality of the countries of the region.64.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic has always desired good-neighbourly relations with the Kingdom of Thailand on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. However  unfortunately those in power in Thailand follow a policy which is unfriendly to the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Despite that  the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic will spare no effort to improve Lao-Thai relations in the legitimate interests of the peoples of both countries and of peace in this region of the world.65.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic wishes to establish good relations with the United States of America on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty  non-interference in domestic affairs  equality and mutual interest. The United States should cease all activities hostile to the Lao People's Democratic Republic  and should not shirk its contribution to healing the wounds of war and to the reconstruction of the national economy of post-war Laos.66.	We are in favour of the complete and rapid withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and we energetically support the position of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea directed towards the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea.67.	We fully support the just struggle of the Arab and Palestinian people for the recovery of the Arab territories illegally occupied by Israel and for the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to the creation of a Palestinian State. The Palestine Liberation Organization  which is the sole true representative of the Palestinian people  must participate on an equal footing and with full rights in all the negotiations for a settlement of the problems of peace in the Middle East.68.	We support the peoples of South Africa  Zimbabwe and Namibia in their struggle against racism and apartheid  against imperialist interference and aggression  for national independence  against oppression and exploitation  and for democracy and social progress; and we strongly condemn all the bloody and savage acts of the racist regimes of SouthAfrica and Rhodesia  and imperialist intervention and aggression.69.	We support the peoples of Mozambique and Angola in their struggle to defend national independence against interference and aggression by imperialists and their reactionary lackeys.70.	We support the struggle of the Cuban people against the pressure and economic blockade brought to bear against it by the United States.71.	We denounce the Fascist junta of Pinochet  which is engaged in bloody repression of the Chilean people  and we energetically support the just struggle of the Chilean people for freedom and democratic rights.72.	We support the peoples of Latin America in their struggle to eliminate the exactions of neo-colonialism  to defend their independence and their sovereignty over their natural resources  and to achieve equitable international relations.73.	We note that the States Members of the United Nations already number 149. However  it is to be regretted that certain member countries still persist in their policy of intimidation  interference and aggression against other countries and that the Governments of certain other countries practice inhuman repression of their own peoples  who are fighting for the right to exist  for democratic freedoms and social progress  and against racism and racial discrimination. But at the same time  in order to camouflage their violation of human rights  the ruling circles in those countries loudly proclaim that they are defending human rights. All this  of course  deceives nobody; on the contrary  every day world opinion denounces those criminal acts more severely.74.	Laos is a small country  of 3.5 million inhabitants  whose ago-old backwardness has been made very much worse by decades of devastating imperialist wars of aggression. For these reasons we ardently long to improve the life of our people and make Laos a rich and prosperous country.75.	In the task of national reconstruction  while relying mainly on our own efforts  we hope that we shall receive support  aid and co-operation in various fields from the United Nations and from friendly countries. We are convinced  furthermore  that the General Assembly at its present session will find appropriate means to create an impetus of support and effective aid to the Lao People's Democratic Republic.76.	We undertake to do everything possible to make our own active contribution to the work of the United Nations in defending peace  strengthening friendship and encouraging the co-operation and progress of the peoples of the world.77.	In conclusion  I wish great success to the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. "
"73",3954,"LBN",32,1977,"﻿79.	 Mr. President  I am delighted to express to you my warmest congratulations on your election to preside over the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. The unanimous vote of confidence which brought you to the presidency is evidence of your merits and of your remarkable personal qualities. I am convinced that under your direction the debates of our Assembly will be conducted with all the necessary authority  thanks to your profound knowledge of international relations and your great experience.80.	I also wish to convey my deep appreciation and respect to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who occupied the presidential Chair during the previous session of the Assembly with the greatest ability. Similarly  I should like to recognize and emphasize the sustained and tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in serving and consolidating world peace.81.	The delegation of Lebanon welcomes into the United Nations two new Members—Viet Nam and Djibouti. Their new presence within the United Nations accords with the principle of universality of our Organization by broadening its foundations and thus facilitating the complete fulfilment of its mission.82.	Before dealing with the questions involved in the general debate  or with the problems of the Middle East  and of Lebanon in particular  I should like to emphasize a fact which to us is very significant. We have come to this session after the peace process has really begun in Lebanon  and we are here to represent as a delegation the profound determination of our country to continue to exist  the unified country of a unified people under the leadership of a freely and constitutionally elected President.83.	Since the preceding session  many events have taken place  near and far  which have given rise to both expectation and concern. We have followed with the greatest interest the development of relations between the great Powers  the North-South dialogue  and the development of the situation in many areas of unrest  such as Africa  Cyprus and the Middle East. We have done so without losing sight of the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the close relationship between political security  military security and economic prosperity.84.	This year the agenda includes a large number of items. Lebanon has participated in studies and in discussion of these items at  previous sessions of the General Assembly  either in meetings of the specialized agencies or at international conferences sponsored by the United Nations. Since our attitudes on all these items are firm and well known  I see no need to go into details. Suffice it for me to point out here that the positions of Lebanon have always been in conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter and in harmony with the policy of non-alignment  the needs of the developing countries and the general rules which govern the evolution of the world.85.	Since the founding of the Organization  Lebanon has continuously demonstrated its faith in the guiding principles of the United Nations  its belief in the need for  and usefulness of  international co-operation and its concern for peace based on justice for the good of mankind.86.	If our international community had been able in good time to find appropriate solutions to the dangerous problems which have become items regularly included in our agenda  the world would not have reached its present stage of insecurity  its peoples would not have become more and more separated by their conflicts  and our Organization  in the execution of its role  would probably not have been reduced to a situation that is close to paralysis. If only the United Nations had succeeded in freeing the world of its complexes of fear and injustice  peace would now reign throughout the world. But unfortunately the facts are otherwise  and the responsibility is shared among us.87.	While  therefore  it is inadmissible for us to exonerate anyone in particular from this responsibility  the great Powers  for their part  bear a responsibility proportionate to their enormous potential  let alone the fact that the Charter of the United Nations has entrusted them with a particular role in the maintenance of peace and security in the world.88.	I say this with conviction and yet without bitterness  despite the fact that my country has been one of the victims of the continuation of the crisis in the Middle East.89.	Before taking up the specific problems of Lebanon  I should like to deal with the Middle East crisis  whose echoes have filled the chambers and halls of the United Nations for the past 30 years  and whose repercussions have been particularly tragic for Lebanon.90.	Lebanon has always been in the vanguard of those defending the Palestinian cause. In this respect  its position remains unchanged. It is the same position as that of the majority of the States Members of the United Nations  which is based on the resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly—particularly resolution 3236  of 22 November 1974. All those resolutions  without exception  condemn the acquisition of the territories by force as illegal; all those resolutions urge Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories and recognize in full the rights of the Palestinian people.91.	Furthermore  one of the consequences of the worsening Middle East crisis has been to perturb the economy of the world  particularly through its repercussions on the energy sector. Hence  it has now become impossible to find solutions to the energy crisis without having previously re-established calm and stability in our part of the world.92.	Thus  no matter how much international diplomacy tries to separate the energy crisis from the Middle East question  it cannot ignore this obvious reality.93.	It is high time for the world Organization to help the Palestinian people recover its full rights  particularly the right of self-determination and the right to establish a homeland in Palestine. It is high time to bring about the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967. It is high time for the world Organization to put an end  once and for all  to the violation of international rules and conventions  to Israeli practices in the occupied territories  including the establishment of settlements and the enforcement of Israeli laws upon the citizens of those territories.94.	In this respect  it must be emphasized that the Arab States have adopted  on the Palestinian question  attitudes which derive from their sincere desire to establish  in the Middle East  a lasting peace based on the principles of right and justice  as well as on the resolutions adopted by the United Nations in its various bodies. Should our Organization fail to abide by those principles and to implement its resolutions  we fear that international relations will then be governed by the law of the jungle.95.	For all these reasons  Lebanon supports the efforts made for a just and lasting peace in the region  on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. We also support the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East in a manner which can ensure the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Lebanon has already expressed its desire to be invited to that Conference  not only in order to assume its responsibilities in the establishment of peace  but also to defend its own rights and interests in each and every question submitted to the Conference  it being clearly understood that the internationally recognized borders of Lebanon are not subject to any discussion whatsoever.96.	Should the United Nations and its various bodies remain in a state of negativism and indifference in the face of the violation of its resolutions  it will continue to create a vicious circle. And the Middle East region would become a fertile ground for successive explosions  which give rise to more dangerous and more extensive confrontations.97.	In all sincerity and seriousness  I must warn this Assembly that the Palestinian problem  in the absence of a just and appropriate solution  will lead to a major conflagration. Lebanon  that small peace-loving country  open to all cultures and peoples  that country unique in the world  through the interaction of the different intellectual  spiritual and human currents within its borders  that country which has always set an outstanding example of harmonious coexistence between creeds and civilizations  that very Lebanon has been  during the past two years  the scene of the most extreme violence.98.	Whatever the direct causes of the bloody events which have taken place in Lebanon and which I shall not go into today  there is no doubt that one of the main elements of the Lebanese tragedy has been created by the delay in finding a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian question. This situation has led to the presence of an excessive number of Palestinians in Lebanon and to a state of unrest caused by the aggravation of the existing contradictions in the Middle East between the different States and their differing policies.99.	The price which Lebanon has paid  as a consequence  is excessive  and we are still bearing a burden beyond our means. The war in Lebanon is  in most respects  the result of a prior injustice committed against a people driven out from its land and deprived of its country. Thus  injustice has itself provoked injustice  and violence has engendered further violence in the host country which is innocent of what befell Palestine.100.	The tolerance which Lebanon has adopted as a standard for its relations with others  and its open attitude towards ideologies and people  are qualities which seem to have turned against Lebanon itself in a disastrous way  and this has been exacerbated not only by the special structure of Lebanon  but also by an abuse of its liberal system.101.	There were Lebanese who believed  when the fighting was taking place on their land  that the world had abandoned them and the values they represented until the day when the Syrian Arab Republic  acting as a brotherly loyal neighbour  took the initiative of intervening at the darkest moment of our struggle  an initiative which was later supported by a number of our brethren Arab countries  to be subsequently endorsed by the Arab community at the summit meetings in Riyadh and Cairo. Thanks to the measures taken following those conferences  Lebanon was able to make progress towards recovering its own security and its well-being. However  Lebanon is still convalescing  for it continues to confront the complex problems of its own reconstruction  together with the challenges  the aggressions and the various attempts at exploitation which expose southern Lebanon and the entire region to enormous dangers.102.	Some people are happy to soothe their consciences by wishing to believe that the war  the destruction  the forced migration and the sufferings experienced by southern Lebanon are the inevitable results of the Middle East crisis  and hence they continue to neglect the adoption of the measures necessary to bring justice to this part of Lebanon. To them we say that Lebanon rejects their logic  that it refuses to continue to suffer  to accept what is happening in southern Lebanon  and to be subjected to the inevitable clashes that this solution generates  pending a solution of the Middle East question.103.	Although the Lebanese are fully aware of the effects of the Palestinian question and of its repercussions on the tragedy of southern Lebanon arid on the Lebanese crisis in general  they cannot accept that Lebanon alone should bear the burden of the consequences  of the hesitations and evasions which prevent a solution of the Middle East and thus become the only arena of conflict in the region compelled to pay for the mistakes made by others.104.	The painful events taking place in southern Lebanon constitute a danger that threatens the region and perhaps the whole world. Aware of the multiple dimensions of the tragedy of southern Lebanon and of the suffering endured by our fellow countrymen there  the Lebanese authorities are sparing no effort to find a solution by any possible means. Taking this aim as a starting-point  the Lebanese authorities have drawn up  with the help of Syria  at the Chtaura meeting  a programme to implement the decisions taken at the Riyadh and Cairo summit conferences. Thus  we are striving to create a climate favourable to the prompt application of these decisions in the south  and to the restoration of peace to this Lebanese land  especially now that  as you know  the fighting has stopped.105.	In this respect  Lebanon is counting on the support it has found with friends who have responded to its appeals throughout the world. In spite of the difficulties in the way of this approach  we firmly hope that during this delicate phase of spirit of peace  good will  self-restraint and wisdom will prevail so that security will again be definitively restored in the south and the prevailing causes of and anxiety will be eliminated.106.	Furthermore  the Assembly is undoubtedly aware of the heavy consequences of the burden that Lebanon now bears as a result of the ordeal it has undergone. Consequently  Lebanon appeals to the international community  and to your Organization in particular  for increasing material and moral support so that we can resume Lebanon's human and cultural role in the world. At this time  I should like to express my appreciation and my deepest thanks to brotherly and friendly countries which have shown us their sympathy and continue to do so throughout the present critical stage of rebuilding our institutions.. I wish to stress in particular the efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom we were happy to receive in Lebanon. We availed ourselves of that opportunity to express to Mr. Waldheim our gratitude for his interest  his concern and his assistance. I also wish to commend the efforts made by the United Nations  whether through its various organs and their related programmes  or through experts sent by the specialized agencies and now working in Lebanon. I should also like to convey my most sincere thanks to the International Committee of the Red Cross which  in the most difficult circumstances  has discharged its deeply appreciated humanitarian task.107.	The establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is absolutely vital. For this reason  we urge the United Nations to fulfil its obligations under the Charter.108.	In this context  Lebanon is determined to defend its sovereignty  its independence and its territorial integrity against any aggression and to demand respect for its rights by all means  especially for its exclusive right to raise any issue that may concern its territory  its problems or its citizens.109.	To all those who have thought or still think they can exploit the differences in Lebanon and the contradictions in the Middle East  we say that our country is resolved to live in peace  within a framework similar to that within which it lived before the recent events  a framework within which our people can live again in peace  understanding and harmony. Similarly  Lebanon is resolved to prevent any interference in its own affairs and to assume to the best of its ability its mission in the Arab world and in the world at large.110.	The sufferings which the people of Lebanon have endured make it more eager for justice and equity  not only with respect to its own cause  but with respect to any other cause that is just.111.	The gamble on peace or war in the Middle East is one on which will depend not only the political and economic equilibrium of the world  but also the fate of present and future generations. This is a fact of which  we believe  responsible leaders are not unaware.112.	The country which I represent is located  as you know  in a region of the world where the main currents of the history of man have sprung up  clashed and merged. My country has known great civilizations; it has also witnessed the decline of many others. Wherever one digs into the earth of Lebanon  there are revealed successive ruins of cities  temples and monuments which were erected as a testimony to the continuous renewal of human society in our land.113.	Lebanon has therefore remained true to itself  witnessing from its mountains and shores this unique panorama of history through thousands of years. From this perspective it has derived its spirit  its civilization and its heritage which have formed the essence of its mission. Thus Lebanon has become in its turn a centre of civilization and of intellectual as well as material exchanges which have enabled us to establish with other nations and countries the closest of ties and a profound commitment to the ideals of free communication between countries and peoples at large.114.	Thus  our history has taught us that life is stronger than death  that coming together is better than drawing apart  and that truth triumphs over falsehood. It has also taught us that man will ultimately succeed in overcoming difficulties  however enormous they may be  provided he is inspired by faith  trust and sincerity.115.	In conclusion  let me express the hope that my faith in the future of my country and in its perennial character will find its response in the faith which each one of you has in his own home land. I also hope that my faith in the wisdom of this Organization and its spirit of justice will enable us all together to work for a better future for our countries and mankind."
"74",3998,"LBR",32,1977,"﻿123.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the Liberian delegation  I congratulate and salute you on your unanimous election to guide the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. With your own admirable personal qualities and the pioneering and pivotal role your great country of Yugoslavia has played and continues to play in promoting peace and security through non-alignment  I feel confident that our deliberations will be ably steered toward the realization of our common aspiration.124.	To your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  we express deep appreciation for the effective manner in which he conducted the affairs of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.125.	The Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to whom we extend our sincere congratulations on his re-election to this important office  is most deserving of our special commendation  not only for the efficiency and dedication which he and his able staff continue to bring to the administration of our Organization  but for his comprehensive  incisive and realistic annual report to this Assembly. We can only hope that this year of growing anxiety for the international community can also become a year of unprecedented opportunity as we resolve-all of us-to undertake bold  courageous and decisive measures to further the objectives of these United Nations.126.	Unfortunately  the note upon which we begin is not too encouraging for the failure of the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly to come to an agreement with respect to the assessment of the results of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation demonstrates that the international community continues to show a woeful lack of the political will and of that degree of mutual accommodation which is indispensable to the establishment of the new international economic order. What is more regrettable is that agreement could not even be reached on how best the United Nations system can carry forward the work of the Paris Conference.127.	Let us therefore endeavour to transform our differences in respect of the assessment of this Conference into guide-posts for renewed efforts and continuing negotiations in the hope that we can generate greater understanding and contribute positively to international economic co-operation.128.	Reduced to its bare essentials  what we are advocating in the establishment of a new international economic order is no more than asking the rich nations to do a little more to enable the poor nations to help themselves. This is the idea which inspires my President  Mr. William R. Tolbert  Jr. in his humanistic capitalism  a concept designed to build a world that is based on peace  security  equality  justice and human dignity for all men and nations.129.	My delegation fully supports the declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 of 29 September 1977 and hopes that the dialogue between the developed and developing countries  of which the Paris Conference was only a part  will continue to be pursued actively at the United Nations and at other international forums.130.	The recent admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti to the United Nations  which my country hails and salutes  not only represents progress for the principle of universality of membership  but bears eloquent testimony  in each case  to the changing nature of our world. Viet Nam and Djibouti represent  each in its own way  the victory of human will over blind intransigence.131.	And yet we can all agree that change in human affairs  as in international affairs  is inevitable. The question is whether we  as members of the international community  will seize the initiative and direct the course of change into peaceful channels for human enrichment and progress  or whether we will allow the forces of human and national selfish interest to stifle the process of change  and consequently plunge us all deeper into the abyss of interminable conflict and tension  thus increasing the threat to international peace and security.132.	As perceived by my country  the challenge to the international community in 1977  a challenge reflected in the issues of moment on the agenda of the thirty-second session of the Assembly  is whether we will collectively diagnose adequately and in a timely manner the requirements for genuine peace and progress  and then collectively undertake adequate and timely measures to advance peace and accelerate progress. We face this challenge just as much with regard to the problems of international economic co-operation and its relations to disarmament and the issue of the law of the sea  as with regard to the critical political questions  especially of southern Africa and the Middle East. We face this challenge as well in the impasse in Cyprus and the growing crisis of human rights violations. In Cyprus  all we ask is the implementation of the resolution which we have adopted here and which has been duly endorsed by the Security Council.133.	That economic problems are priorities in our concerns today we have fully recognized. As we therefore continue to deploy efforts to make sanity  reason and compassion prevail in our economic relations  let us heed as well the perceptive observation of the Secretary-General that:""The question of disarmament lies at the heart of the problem of international order  for  in an environment dominated by the international arms race  military and strategic considerations tend to shape the over-all relations between States  affecting all other relations and transactions and disturbing the economy.""134.	Because my Government sees the issue of disarmament in the context of world order and progress  not only have we given full support to the convening in 1978 of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament  but we are of the firm belief that  whether we are talking about nuclear or conventional arms limitation  nuclear proliferation  or the relationship between development and disarmament  the issue is a concern of all  not simply of the more powerful of the international community or those who are members of the ""nuclear club"".135.	My Government regrets exceedingly that there is a continuing absence of international agreement to regulate the affairs of the oceans of the world. At a time when the call is persistent for a new world-wide political and economic order  the vital area of the sea cannot be left unregulated  as that would favour power at the expense of justice. We fervently hope that next March in Geneva we will witness the beginning of the process of initiating in this area international regulation conducive to the interests of all States.136.	A happy note in international relations is the recent signing of the United States-Panama Treaties on the Panama Canal. My Government renews its welcome of that development as a positive step towards furthering international understanding.137.	The issue in southern Africa is continuingly one of fundamental human rights denied a preponderant majority of the people by a lunatic clique of petty-hearted racists; it is one of restoring justice and human dignity to an oppressed segment of humanity; of effectively curbing support and sustenance for apartheid; of following through with determination the process of decolonization  and removing the anachronism of racist minority rule and apartheid from the continent of Africa. The issue is moving away from catastrophic racial confrontation to racial harmony.138.	While southern Africa is essentially an African problem  the principles which suffer flagrant violation in the subregion are universal principles. Moreover  for diverse reasons  associations have been nurtured over the years between the subregion and various elements particularly external to the continent. The international community  must be constructively involved in evolving an early but genuinely African solution. That imperative found echoes in the Maputo Declaration on Zimbabwe and Namibia  as well as the Lagos Declaration on South Africa-declarations which have the unreserved endorsement of my Government.139.	Some of the developments of late have given cause for guarded optimism. I refer particularly to the Anglo- American proposals on Zimbabwe  proposals which my Government sees as constituting a good and important basis for initiating the process of negotiation. With an emerging united national patriotic leadership for the people of Zimbabwe and goodwill on the part of all the parties involved  we entertain the hope that the limited step already taken by the Security Council in implementation of an element of the proposals will gain momentum so that the anxiety we now feel for our brothers and sisters of Zimbabwe will be transformed into the satisfaction of our expectations. At any rate Liberia will persevere with free Africa and the OAU in the liberation struggle until majority rule and independence come to the people of Zimbabwe.140.	The efforts of the contact group of the five Western members of the Security Council in respect of Namibia also deserve our commendation  as long as they remain within the framework of Security Council resolution 385(1976). While it would seem that there is now a brief interlude in those talks  we remain hopeful that the talks will soon be resumed with no prejudice to the progress so far achieved. In the meanwhile  my Government will continue its full support of the efforts of the OAU and SWAPO until Namibia  in the entirety of its territory  attains independence.141.	The Republic of Liberia  whose existence was the end-result of grinding oppression  will remain unrelenting in its opposition to the evil system of apartheid in South Africa. The recent death in police custody and under highly questionable circumstances of the South African nationalist Mr. Steven Biko and the callous insensitivity of the apartheid regime to that human tragedy are yet further demonstrations of the wanton brutality which apartheid rains daily upon the oppressed masses of that country. Liberia will continuingly concert its efforts with a view not only to the total destruction of apartheid but also to- bringing majority rule and self-determination to South Africa.142.	We want here fully to associate ourselves with our brothers and sisters in South Africa today  11 October—the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners-as they remember the plight of political prisoners and other victims of apartheid. We are with them in heart and spirit.143.	As regards the problem of the Middle East  Liberia considers that the question of Palestinian rights is one of the principal elements. My Government believes that all States in the region have a right to independent existence within secure and recognized boundaries.144.	We are of the view that it is imperative that the current situation in the region of ""no war  no peace'"" should be replaced by genuine mutual accommodation and mutual preparedness to act in good faith. That would entail  among other things  the return by Israel of all Arab territory occupied since the 1967 war""; an immediate end  in the interim  to the establishment by Israel of ""settlements"" in the occupied Arab territories; and the recognition by Israel of the political reality of the Palestinian people and their legitimate national rights. But that would also entail unequivocal Arab acceptance of the existence and permanence of the State of Israel.•145. Liberia believes that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East would serve as a most useful forum for initiating negotiation with a view to resolving Arab-Israeli differences. But that ""Conference can be successful only if all the concerned parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  participate. That is why Liberia applauds the joint American-Soviet statement of 1 October in that regard  and fervently hopes that fears and suspicions on the part of Israelis and Arabs alike can give way to courageous action and accommodation-and even calculated risk—so that the Geneva Conference can in fact be convened before the end of 1977.146. My delegation believes that the question of the violation of human rights is also implicit in the leading international issues on our agenda. We see that fundamental principle blatantly assailed in southern Africa  in the Middle East  in Cyprus and in other areas of world tension. The issue is also of consuming concern at the important review meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which is now under way in Belgrade. And yet  as Members of the United Nations  we have all solemnly pledged  by the fact of our United Nations membership  to uphold  defend and promote fundamental human rights  especially as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My Government continues to take very seriously the responsibilities inherent in Liberia's adherence to that Declaration. And we wish here to indicate our support for the idea of upgrading the head of the United Nations Division of Human Rights to a commissioner  as a means of focusing greater attention on a vital area of the United Nations.147.	With reference to the growing contemporary crisis of human rights violations  the President of Liberia  Mr. William R. Tolbert  Jr. said at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Gabon last July:""There must be a common standard which the international community should recognize and apply equally for the protection of life and limb  liberty and property; and no one should be deprived of those sacred rights  contrary to universal laws or declarations.""Continuing  President Tolbert said:""Mankind is the same everywhere  and its rights should be respected and safeguarded in every way at all times and in all places. It is therefore absolutely wrong in North  West  Central  East and South Africa or for that matter in any part of our one world for human dignity and human rights to be irreverently invaded and assailed.""And in a note of admonition to the OAU Assembly  President Tolbert indicated:""The same standards of moral integrity and humane uprightness we apply to our foes must also be applied to our friends; we must consider ourselves obligated to practice the same among ourselves and accord to our own peoples.""148.	Thirty-two years have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations  which was' dedicated to the active promotion of peace by constructively and co-operatively responding to world human needs which still remain central to international relations. This great international Organization and the phenomenon of international organizations in general have been invaluable  almost indispensable  instruments in mankind quest for a stable  just and progressive world society. Whether young or old  regional or trans- regional  such international organizations as the Organization of American States  the OAU  the League of Arab States  the Association of South-East Asian Nations  the non-aligned countries movement  the Afro-Arab Conference  and perhaps even those that have grown out of the antagonism of the cold war  have each in their respective regions or areas of emphasis  complemented the efforts of the United Nations  advanced the idea of a global community  and thus promoted international understanding and co-operation. In recognition of this role of international organi7ations  perhaps the United Nations  the most universal of them all  should resolve to devote a year to international organizations.149.	My delegation formally proposes that as a tribute to these great institutions for facilitating international relations  the year 1980 be designated international Organizations Year  a year when world-wide attention would be focused on the significant contributions of international organizations in containing or resolving world problems and thus serving even more effectively as instruments for the maintenance of global peace and security.150.	At the outset  I spoke of the challenge of change in our contemporary world and suggested the need for us all genuinely to recognize it as imperative if international co-operation is to be maximized and conflict minimized. With regard to some of the major political and economic problems we face  we can entertain some hopes as of now. With regard to others  such as those  notably  of interference in the affairs of States and the issue of human rights  optimism as of now would be premature.151.	And yet  in the nature of things we cannot despair. From every situation of conflict we must diligently seek possible elements of co-operation; from our differences we must extract the least likelihood of agreement upon which to build understanding. Our condition of interdependence on this planet leaves us no viable alternative. We must therefore nurture the forces for conciliation  co-operation  collaboration and accommodation in our international relationships. Above all  let us work at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly so that the growing anxiety we feel in 1977 about the burning issues on our agenda will be transformed into hopeful and wholesome break-through in 1978 and in the years ahead.

"75",4044,"LBY",32,1977,"﻿73.	 In the name of God  the Almighty  the Merciful and the Compassionate  allow me first  on behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  to express our condolences to our brothers in Yemen for the tragic death of their late leader  President Al-Hamdi  who was a victim of betrayal by the enemies of progress. At this time  when we present our condolences to the brotherly peoples of Yemen  we hope that this shedding of innocent blood will give those people an impetus forward for their own benefit and that of the Arab nation.74.	Mr. President  allow me to express  on behalf of the delegation of the Socialist' People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  our pleasure on your election to preside over the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our pleasure is the result not only of our awareness of your personal ability and qualifications  which we are confident will be an important factor in the success of our deliberations  but also the result of the brotherly and strategic relations that bind our two friendly countries and our countries' leaders  who both struggle  side by side  within the framework of the non-aligned movement for the achievement of freedom  justice and international peace and security.75.	It is also my pleasure  Mr. President  to express the appreciation of the delegation of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  the representative of Sri Lanka  for the services he rendered to the international community during the last session.76.	We are also gratified to see the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Waldheim  continuing in his post and performing his responsibilities with the same high standards and indefatigable commitment to serving our Organization  which  we are sincerely confident  will be able to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples. We were also happy that the Secretary-General visited the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on 23 August last. The visit provided a favourable opportunity for the exchange of views on particularly important issues  andI should like to emphasize the support and co-operation of the Jamahiriya for his efforts in the interest of freedom and justice.77.	The delegation of my country is extremely happy that two new States  namely  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  have joined the international community. The admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations constitutes a victory for the forces of peace and justice—a victory for the peoples of the third world against the forces of terrorism and domination. The great people of Viet Nam have achieved the greatest victory in modern history against the largest imperialist Power. They have now again won a political victory over the very forces which tried  by illegitimate means  to obstruct their revolutionary progress. With a wealth of experience obtained over 30 years of struggle  the people of Viet Nam  in joining this international Organization  will constitute an effective force enhancing its efforts to ensure the interests of the peoples and to eliminate domination  manipulation and monopoly.78.	The delegation of my country is also happy that the Republic of Djibouti  having joined the OAU and the League of Arab States  has joined the international community The independence of Djibouti and its admission to membership in the United Nations represents a victory for the African peoples against the forces of imperialistic domination and the liquidation of one of the bastions of colonialism on our great continent. We are confident that the presence among us of the Republic of Djibouti will enhance our efforts to fulfil the common hopes and aspirations of our peoples.79.	The United Nations has devoted considerable efforts to the cause of peace and towards achieving freedom and prosperity for the peoples of the world. Yet  despite these efforts  tension continues to prevail in some parts of the world  and the forces of injustice  colonialism  Zionism and racism continue to perpetrate aggression and continue in their attempts at domination and manipulation in obstruction of the efforts of our Organization.80.	The straggling peoples of Africa  to which we are proud to belong  have been able to achieve magnificent victories against the forces of colonial domination in recent years—in Angola  Mozambique  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  and Djibouti. However  certain parts of the continent which are dear to us still suffer from the worst forms of racism and colonialist manipulation: namely  Zimbabwe  South Africa and Namibia. The racist regimes there  supported by imperialism and colonialism  persist in pursuing their inhuman policies  in total disrespect of the whole world. The peoples of those areas  however  supported by progressive forces in Africa and in the world  have been able to inflict severe blows on these racist regimes despite the fact that they are supported by the forces of colonialism and imperialism.81.	The victories won by the peoples of Zimbabwe  South Africa and Namibia are also victories over colonialism and imperialism  which are the arch-enemies of the independence  freedom and aspirations of the peoples. The forces of evil and the imperialist supporters of racism were overwhelmed by the victories achieved by our peoples in Africa. Therefore they have resorted to subterfuge—instead of opposing the liberation movement  they go along with it  seeking to divert its course to serve their interests and the interests of their racist puppets. We wonder: since when has American and British colonialism been known to support the peoples' causes? Was it not Britain  aided by America  that created the regime of Ian Smith  the racist regime in South Africa and the Zionist regime in Palestine? These colonial Powers are the ones which supply the regimes of Vorster and Smith with weapons. These colonialist Powers also extend their political support of the racist regimes  illegitimately deploying a privilege which they have accorded themselves  namely  the privilege to veto the fulfilment of the aspirations and hopes of the peoples in those areas.82.	As Africans  we are the peoples of the world most capable of appreciating peace  because we have struggled for many years  sacrificing millions of lives. We  more than others  value peace; this love of peace makes us more committed and resolute in the cause of freedom-genuine and indivisible freedom. The people of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  having fought for scores of years against Italian Fascist colonialism and imperialism  for the liquidation of foreign bases in our country and for the control .of foreign monopolies  have supported the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa in their struggle for freedom. Our people has extended assistance and will continue to extend assistance to these peoples in the cause of the achievement of their freedom  which is also our freedom. The leader of our great First of September Revolution  Colonel Muammar Al-Qaddafi  explained our strategic policy regarding the cause of liberation on the African continent when he said: ""We do not consider ourselves independent as long as other parts of our continent suffer colonialism and racism.""83.	The delegation of the Jamahiriya has described our country's position concerning the question of the people of Zimbabwe in recent days in the Security Council. We are in favour of any initiative aiming at the elimination of the racist regime of Smith. By this we mean that we completely support and endorse the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe  under the leadership of the Patriotic Front  to overthrow the racist regime. From past experience we have learned that the United Nations should be careful lest it be used as a means to obstruct the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe. 84.	Some parts of our continent remain occupied. The continued occupation of the island of Mayotte  which is an indivisible part of the Comoro Islands  constitutes a violation of the sovereignty of a State Member of the United Nations and of the OAU.85.	The situation on the African continent  including the struggle against racist regimes  cannot be separated from the situation in the Arab world and the struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples against the racist and aggressive regime in occupied Palestine and other occupied Arab territories. The racist regimes in occupied Palestine  in South Africa and in Zimbabwe are fundamentally interrelated. That interrelation was best described in the historic General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism and a form of racial discrimination.86.	We in the Arab world  like those on the African continent  are involved in a struggle against inhuman racist regimes  representing a small alien white minority. These regimes were created by colonialism. The Smith regime and the racist regime in South Africa were created by the same colonialism as that which handed over Palestine to the racist minority now ruling it. The imperialism that supports the racist Zionists in occupied Palestine is the same imperialism as that which supports the racist regimes in southern Africa. As imperialism has tried to divert the course of revolution in Africa  it has tried to divert the course of revolution in occupied Palestine and the Arab nations.87.	What is described as the Middle East question is in fact a question of racist colonialism  a colonialism that has uprooted the people of Palestine from their homeland  has occupied Arab territories and continues to perpetuate aggression against the Arab nation.88.	We in the Arab world seek peace and we also cherish freedom. We believe that peace cannot be attained unless the nature of the racist regime in occupied Palestine is radically changed. The Arab nation as a whole  and the people of Palestine in particular are the victims of the imperialist Zionist aggression. There is an aggressor and there is a victim. If we seek a genuine peace  then it must be realized that no solution can be reached unless the aggression is eliminated and the victim is assisted.89.	Therefore  it is absurd that the imperialist forces should be attempting to trample on the rights of the people of. Palestine and to undermine their resistance and their national aspirations.90.	I have stated that the Arab nation seeks peace. But what is peace? It is not the kind of peace that imperialist forces seek to impose on the Arab nation and on the people of Palestine. It is not the peace of the imperialist Powers which are seeking to pose as arbitrators. How can an aggressor be an arbitrator? How can the United States of America be an arbitrator? Israel is nothing but a fortress for colonialism  for world imperialism and for the United States of -America. The organic interrelationship between the masters and their agents is deep-rooted. Without American aid and its support of the Zionist aggressors  the situation in the area would never have reached such a degree of deterioration.91.	It is rather strange  but not surprising  that colonialists should suffer from a lack of logic. Thus we note that the United States of America denounces the establishment of settlements; but who provides Israel with the financial means to establish those settlements? And who provides Israel with arms to impose those settlements by force? Regrettably this is the nature of imperialism and of aggressors. The situation poses a threat to peace in the territory. I repeat  without American imperialist support  the Zionist enemy would not have been able to flout the Charter of the United Nations and Its resolutions and disregard human rights and values.92.	The desperate colonial attempts to divert the course of the Arab revolution by bestowing legitimacy on the occupier will definitely not succeed in the long run  and if they do succeed in dividing the Arab nation and obstructing its unity and solidarity  such success will only be temporary. The Arab nation is a creative force which is capable of overcoming setbacks and of achieving victories. Those who know the history of our nation will not find it difficult to understand the present circumstances in the area and what the future of the area will be.93.	Two days ago the terrorist Dayan saw fit to threaten even the United Nations. Sometimes we find him speaking in the name of the United States  saying that that country will oppose any move to change the Security Council resolution. He spoke very distinctly in the name of the United States about the legitimacy of the settlements that have been created in defiance of the United Nations. I would ask that intransigent representative of the terrorist State  the representative of Menachem Begin  that great terrorist well known in Deir Yasin: what was the fate that befell Hitler? What was the fate of nazism? What was the fate of Italian fascism?94.	We in the Arab nations went through the experience of colonialism long ago  at the time of the so-called Crusades. There can never be peace unless the nature of racist Zionism  of which its representative boasts  is changed.95.	These assertions we make carry no implication that we are opposed to peace. No one is more in favour of peace than we are. But the peace that we seek is a genuine peace; not a peace based on the endorsement of injustice and the legitimization of aggression.96.	We need a humanitarian peace based on the supremacy of law over aggression. We want a genuine peace not based on racial supremacy or the legitimization of aggression.97.	We do not have to look far to see the racist nature of the Zionist regime. We have recently seen the expulsion of many American blacks of the Jewish faith from Israel  which is a further proof of what we say and reminds us of the past. Peace can only be attained by allowing the people of Palestine to fulfil their aspirations for freedom in their homeland and by restoring to them their right to return to their homeland and that same right to self-determination which is enjoyed by other nations of the world. Human rights cannot be sacred in some parts of the world and ignored in other parts. No State  whether Arab or non- Arab  has the right to proclaim itself a guardian of the Palestinian people or its revolution.98.	In their efforts to divide the Arab nation  the imperialists refer to some Arab States as rejectionist and to others as non-rejectionist and moderate. But what is it that is being rejected? In our opinion  the Arab peoples are all in agreement on rejecting efforts to dictate the terms of surrender to them and to perpetuate the effects of aggression. There are no differences between the States of the Arab nation with regard to this point. We all reject the dictation of the terms of peace. It is the Zionist enemy that rejects the decisions of the United Nations and of other international organizations. It is the Zionists who reject all efforts aimed at achieving a genuine peace. The racist- Zionist regime has best expressed its aggressive nature and its racist practices by proclaiming the occupied Arab territories as ""liberated lands"". The Zionists continue to establish racist settlements in occupied Arab territories. It is not I alone who say this; this was said by the representative of the terrorist gang when he spoke here two days ago. Israel's racist policies are based on continued expansion and aggression against the Arab nations and against the Palestinian people. Its efforts to achieve the objective of zionism-namely  of establishing a Zionist entity encompassing the entire area between the Nile and the Euphrates-is becoming more obvious every day. Up to now there has been no official map for what is called the State of Israel  as there is for every other State in the world. The map of Israel  according to the expansionist plans of international zionism that were endorsed several decades ago  extends from the Nile to the Euphrates.99.	The lesson learned from the struggle of peoples has proved the truth of the views of the late leader  Gamal Abdel Nasser  namely  that what was taken by force can only be restored by force. We in the Arab world hate war more than do any other peoples  but when war is in the cause of liberation and in the cause of human dignity  it is legitimate. The Holy Koran says: ""Warfare is incumbent upon you  yet it is hateful to you."" The solution of the so-called Middle East problem cannot be reached by communiqués and conferences. It can only be attained by the restoration of what has been usurped  by preventing the usurper from continuing in his criminal acts  by enforcing justice  by recognizing rights and by opposing aggression. Such a solution lies in the solidarity and unity of the Arab nation  for in the final analysis that nation is on the side of justice.100.	The events that have taken place in New York in recent days in connexion with what has been called a solution are somewhat comical when evaluated in terms of the actual state of affairs regarding such a solution. The Soviet-American statement issued on 1 October 1977  which some considered contained positive elements  mentioned for the first time the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. But the ink had hardly dried on that document when an American communiqué was issued stating that the words ""national rights"" had not been mentioned because that would imply the right to self- determination and statehood. Mention of that was deliberately omitted because the Americans do not endorse the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Then came the American-Israeli statement of 5 October 1977  which cancelled and completely nullified the intention and meaning of the Soviet-American statement. That was after the statement by President Carter himself in which the solidarity and the alliance of the United States with the enemy was revealed. It also became perfectly clear that America could under no circumstances act as an intermediary and that America and Israel were one party in a colonialist campaign against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people. The events of the last few days in New York have revealed the bitter truth and illustrated the Zionist domination even of the American people itself. This great people is suffering from zionism just as we suffer from Zionism in our part of the world. That reminds us of the remarks of a loyal diplomat representing his country in Cairo—I think his name was Ness—who said that the-bonds linking Washington and Tel Aviv were stronger than those between Washington and Hawaii or Alaska. Time magazine has mentioned that every Israeli obtains $600 from the United States of America annually. Is that the logic of those who wish to be mediators? The journalist Joseph Hartsch referred to these vested interests in an article published in the Christian Science Monitor in its issue of 6 October 1977  saying that:""Mr. Carter intervened with the utmost reluctance. Only two years ago President Gerald Ford and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger decided that it was necessary to use American leverage on Israel. They delayed the delivery of some American weapons to Israel. The Israeli lobby in Washington obtained the signatures of 76 senators to a letter calling on the President 'to be responsive to Israel's urgent military and economic needs'. The Israeli's got what they wanted.""Mr. Carter has picked up the challenge which Prime Minister Begin offered by his annexation policy. The question is posed whether the State of Israel can control more votes in the Senate of the United States than can the President of the United States. The Israeli lobby is the most powerful possessed by any foreign Government in Washington; even Mr. Carter cannot be sure that he actually can swing more votes in the Senate than can Mr. Begin.""That is what was reported by an eyewitness.101.	It is absurd and regrettable that freedom fighters in Palestine and in Africa should be branded terrorists. This poses the question  Who are the terrorists: are they the freedom fighters or those who perpetrate acts of aggression against peace-loving peoples? According to the logic of imperialism  the terrorists are the freedom fighters  those who support the cause of freedom and humanity. It is important to differentiate between terrorism and fighting for freedom. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  inspired by the Islamic religion  which is the faith of our people and whose provisions are strictly observed  is opposed to terrorism. It condemns the hijacking of aircraft  the taking of hostages and the killing of innocent people. As the Holy Koran says:""On that account: We ordained For the Children of Israel That if any one slew A person-unless it be For murder or for spreading Mischief in the land- It would be as if He slew the whole people: And if any one saved a life. It would be as if he saved the life of the whole people."" 102.	The revolutionary forces of the world  which support the just causes of peoples and the cause of human rights violations  have been the target of a hostile campaign waged by the colonialist-imperialist Powers to slander them by calling them terrorists. Yet  what the colonialists say will not deceive anyone because everyone knows the facts and everyone knows who the terrorists are. Everyone knows that they are the international terrorists who dominate other peoples  monopolize other peoples' resources and commit acts of military aggression against them. Was not the killing of millions of persons in Viet Nam an act of terrorism? And is not the killing of the people of Palestine and of the peoples of Zimbabwe and South Africa also terrorism? What offences have the peoples of Viet Nam  Palestine and Africa committed? Of course  what happened was not the fault of the great American people  which was forced into involvement in a terrorist  imperialist war in support of Menachem Begin  the terrorist of Deir Yasin. Nor was it the fault of the tens of thousands of innocent American individuals who were killed in a war which served only colonialist and imperialist interests.103.	In considering this question the United Nations should define the term ""terrorism1'. Terrorism is an act perpetrated by major colonialist Powers with a view to imposing their political terms and solutions while refusing to engage in a dialogue with smaller States.104.	I should like to assure the Assembly that the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will persevere in its Islamic and humanitarian policies in opposition to terrorism and to the murder of innocent persons. It will continue to support the just causes of struggling peoples. Our objective is to contribute to the elimination of the forces of evil  injustice  Zionism and racism  to the attainment of prosperity and justice and to the protection of human dignity.105.	Tension is widespread in many other parts of the world. Some issues have been taken up by the United Nations while others have been forced upon it. As a Mediterranean State we cannot be isolated from events in that area. Together with other peoples in the area  my country is contributing to the efforts to rid the area of the dangers of war and international conflicts. That can be achieved only by the elimination of foreign bases aid naval fleets which pose a direct threat to the freedom and security of the peoples of the area. As long as such bases and naval fleets remain in the area  the Mediterranean cannot become a sea of peace and harmony.106.	In discussing the situation in the Mediterranean  one cannot but refer to an important issue  namely  the Cyprus question. The situation in Cyprus is one of the causes for our concern. We support the efforts of the United Nations to solve this problem. The solution should  in our view  be based on an agreement between the Greek and Turkish communities reconciling them both within the framework of the unity  sovereignty and non-alignment of Cyprus. The withdrawal of British colonialist bases from Cyprus would be one factor contributing to the solution of this question  for those bases pose a threat not only to the independence of Cyprus but also to that of the neighbouring peoples.107.	The situation in Korea continues to pose a threat to international peace and security. The presence of foreign forces there impedes the unification of its two parts. The presence of those forces under the United Nations flag is in itself a violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. The presence of those forces has undermined the efforts of the Korean people to reunify their country and has weakened the prestige and role of the United Nations whose name and flag have been used in the perpetration of aggression against the struggling people of Korea.108.	The time has come to put an end to this flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and to the abuse of the Organization to achieve the objectives of certain Powers in their attempts to widen their spheres of interest. No longer should the international Organization  whose sole raison d'etre is to achieve peace and prosperity  be used as a tool of division and aggression.109.	Strongly committed to the principles of unity  the people of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya fully support the legitimate struggle of the Korean people for the restoration of national unity and for the elimination of the artificial division imposed on them by force for over a quarter of a century.110.	It is the view of my delegation that the first and imperatively important step to be taken in this direction is the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces stationed in South Korea  since those forces constitute  in our opinion  the main obstacle in the path of a settlement.111.	The issues taken up by our Organization are  without a doubt  important and serious. Their solution requires the concerted efforts of its peace-loving Member States and the necessary impetus in the Organization to enable it to achieve solutions to these issues. .No one can deny the significance of the efforts made by the United Nations  nor  on the other hand  can anyone ignore the difficulties faced by the United Nations. The most important of these difficulties is inequality of Member States within the Organization  which is contrary to the spirit of the Charter. The time has come for the Charter of the United Nations to be reviewed with a view to guaranteeing equality for all States regardless  of their populations and military and economic might. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has raised this question in the OAU  in the Islamic Conference  and in Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. All those conferences have adopted unanimous resolutions requesting a re-examination of the United Nations Charter with a view to achieving equality among Member States. Equality cannot be attained as long as a very small number of States  a handful  enjoy the right to veto the decisions of the majority of the members of the international community  a right which has been abused in obstructing the cause of freedom for peoples. There is no justification for the existence of this baseless right. A small number of States bestowed it upon themselves against the will of the majority of the peoples of the world. The situation today is very different  and the will of the overwhelming majority of States can no longer be ignored.112.	The commitment of the small States to peace is no less than that of the so-called big Powers. The use of the veto obstructs the efforts of the international Organization.113.	We in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believe in the role of the United Nations and support it fully. The UnitedNations role in the preservation of peace is the hope of the peoples and the guardian of smaller States. If every State  especially the big Powers  can work in isolation without the United Nations  then what is the use of the United Nations? There are some countries  Members of this Organization  which take unilateral action and apply the law of the jungle  and think they can dictate their own terms and solve their problems by the use of force  as has been happening in many parts of the world  and which happened in Jamahiriya lately; for how long can we permit those big Powers to work in isolation outside the United Nations  or to use mercenaries to invade the countries of peoples and destroy their independence? The use of mercenaries is a practice that warrants our attention and consideration. What happened in the sister Republic of Benin a few months ago is alerting small States to the seriousness of this matter. The independence of smaller countries is threatened as a result of this neo-colonialist practice. The United Nations should investigate and put an end to this practice.114.	Adherence to United Nations objectives and principles and compliance with its resolutions are now more important than ever before. It is imperative that the United Nations should exercise deterrent measures and enforce the penalties provided for in the Charter against whoever violates the Charter  follows the law of the jungle  and disregards the resolutions of this Organization. As long as there is the right of veto  and as long as there are some countries which are trying to impose their will on this Organization  we can do nothing about it.115.	Mr. President  the non-aligned movement  whose foundations your country  under the leadership of President Tito  helped to establish  is playing an important role in international affairs. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  which is proud to be playing an active role as a member of this movement  reaffirms its adherence to the policies of non-alignment. The delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya takes this occasion to express its support of this movement and of its role in the preservation of international peace and security. We are opposed to military alliances  armed camps and blocs. Our country has freed its economy and liberated its territory from foreign colonialist bases and has joined this group in order to participate  within its framework  in the elimination of spheres of influence and domination  and in order to uphold the right of nations to liberate their homelands. The presence of foreign bases in the territories of small nations poses a threat  not only to their own independence  but also to the independence of neighbouring countries and to international security. We welcome any co-operation on the basis of equality. We oppose interference in the internal affairs of States and do not allow others to interfere in our own affairs. We are willing to co-operate with any State along the lines of these independent  non-aligned policies. We reject any terms dictated by any Power. In spite of the small size of our country and its limited resources  we are staunch in our principles and strong in the support we get from peace-loving peoples. We do not wish to align ourselves with any side  and we deal with States irrespective of their military or economic power or their size  but rather on the basis of their respect for the sovereignty of other States and of their support for just causes.116.	The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believes that regional organizations such as the OAU  the League of Arab States and the Islamic Conference  play a significant role in supporting United Nations efforts for peace and freedom. Experience has shown  in recent years  that these organizations have played a significant role in the support of the work of our Organization  both in the context of their contributions within the United Nations  and in the context of the meetings they have held in their respective regions. My country had the honour to host the Eighth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers from 27 Jurcad A1 Awal to 3 Jumad Al-Thani 1397H  corresponding to 16 to 22 May 1977.117.	At that Conference the Foreign Ministers dealt with important matters having far-reaching implications at the regional and international levels  and they adopted important resolutions and recommendations concerning those matters. One of the topics of discussion was apartheid. The Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the commitment of the Islamic States to the struggle against racist practices in South Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe and occupied Palestine. They stressed the need for the elimination of those abhorrent practices  which seek to humiliate man on the grounds of colour  creed  race and religion. The Ministers also discussed the situation in the Middle East  noting with regret that the Zionist entity continued to follow a policy of aggression in the form of occupation  expansion  annexation and the mistreatment of the Arab population in the occupied territories. The Conference expressed its deep concern in regard to the dangerous situation resulting from the continued Zionist violations of the United Nations Charter  the principles and provisions of international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Conference pointed out that this situation would lead the world to the brink of new armed hostilities.118.	The Conference paid a tribute to the struggle of the Arab people of Palestine and of the other occupied Arab territories  and reaffirmed its support for their legitimate struggle to liberate the occupied territories and to end the Zionist occupation  restoring their inalienable national rights and protecting the Islamic  Arab and spiritual status of Jerusalem. The Conference emphasized that the Palestine question is the crux of the Middle East problem and that a just and durable peace can be attained only by the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Zionists from all occupied Arab territories and the restoration to the people of Palestine of their right to self-determination  and by the creation of an independent State in Palestine.119.	The Conference reiterated its pledged to support fully the struggle of the people of South Africa and the liberation movements in southern Africa  and to continue the provision of moral and material assistance to those movements to enable them to persevere in their struggle for freedom and independence.120.	In the economic field  the Conference urged the developed States to take a positive attitude on international economic co-operation  emphasizing the importance of the implementation of decisions related to the Integrated Programme on Commodities and the commitment of the developing countries to the establishment of a common fund at the earliest time possible. The final communiqué was circulated as document.121.	As a third-world developing country  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will work with other delegations  directly or through collective arrangements  in resolving third-world issues. On that basis and in the cause of third world solidarity and mutual co-operation  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Islamic Conference have helped the Government and the people of the Philippines to resolve a domestic problem that had caused the death of many innocent people. As a result of the Tripoli Agreement  peace has been restored to the southern Philippines for the first time in many years. We are confident that the response and positive attitude demonstrated by the parties concerned  and particularly the Philippine Government  will encourage the Islamic Conference to continue its work in resolving this issue  with the aim not of interfering in the internal affairs of another State but rather of promoting solidarity among the third world peoples  of which the peoples of the members of' the Islamic Conference and the Philippines are a part. The Islamic Conference also participates in reducing tensions in whatever part of the world they may arise.122.	Humanity cannot enjoy lasting peace so long as a terrible arms race continues both quantitatively and qualitatively. Despite numerous endeavours since the end of the Second World War  during which the world witnessed the worst horrors and pains inflicted on nations by war  the world still witnesses an increase in the production of destructive weaponry and in their sophisticated use. The race for the acquisition of such weapons is tremendous  and the budgets of many States have been exhausted for that purpose. The arms industry not only has absorbed funds that are supposed to be spent on food  education and medical treatment  but has also diverted the ingenuity of mankind and moved it as if spellbound towards the course of taking the shortest and quickest route to the pollution of the environment and the contamination of even what is left for human life.123.	While almost $400 billion have been spent on the production and purchase of weapons  over half a billion human beings are the victims of hunger and malnutrition and threatened by starvation  about half of the world's children of school age are without education  and half of the world's population have no medical treatment or care.124.	This proves the seriousness of the situation and calls for speedy and effective international measures to end this terrible arms race  and for the allocation of funds to the welfare of man.125.	The non-aligned States have realized the seriousness of the situation  and at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government held in Colombo in 1976 they called for a special session of the General Assembly to consider this serious matter. At its thirty-first session the General Assembly endorsed that recommendation. We wish the special session to be held next year every success. We hope that the representatives of the peoples of the world will agree on a declaration on the dangers of weapons that embodies specific principles prohibiting the production and use of arms  and on a programme of action to ensure the implementation of the principles and effective measures provided for in the declaration. That programme of action should envision a time framework that takes into account the dangerous realities of the situation and the fact that no time can be lost.126.	The delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will make every effort to contribute to the success of this session and to promote the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament so that it can fulfil its responsibilities in the cause of international peace and security.127.	The production by certain States of destructive weapons does not serve the cause of international peace and security. It was announced recently that the United States has produced the neutron bomb The United Nations should make every effort to dissuade the United States from continuing the production of this destructive weapon and to prohibit its production and proliferation.128.	The period after the Second World War has witnessed an important development in international economic relations  namely  the emergence of multilateral economic co-operation. Experience over the last three decades has shown the potential of such co-operation in relation to the promotion of economic and social progress for all people as a primary step towards international peace and security.129.	Thus  it can be rightly said that the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly represented a turning point in the history of international economic relations and of the Organization.130.	At these sessions a set of measures was recommended with a view to restructuring international economic relations  eliminating the injustice to which many human sectors have been subjected  correcting the imbalance in various sectors of the United Nations system and establishing a new system that would be more responsive to the provisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which set the foundations for the new international economic order.131.	The spirit of co-operation which prevailed at the discussions of the seventh special session represented significant progress towards international economic cooperation. My delegation had hoped that a similar spirit would prevail in the discussions of the Conference on International 'Economic Co-operation  the so-called North- South dialogue. Yet the outcome of the Paris Conference was disappointing as far as the developing countries were concerned: the Conference was unable to tackle the major issues. The question of protecting the purchasing power of the products and exports of the developing countries  the question of debts and the question of the transfer of technology are all basic matters on which a lack of agreement has impeded the establishment of a new international economic order.132.	We do not expect that the new international economic order can be established overnight. Yet it is regrettable that the consultations and discussions regarding the principal foundations of this order are not going forward at an appropriate pace. Sometimes we even witness a change in the position of some States  which poses a threat to the principle of international economic cooperation. It is important that serious efforts should continue so as to achieve the objectives envisaged in General Assembly resolutions; otherwise  the results will be detrimental—and not only to the peoples of the developing countries.133.	The proposal of the Secretary-General concerning the establishment of an international energy institute is worthy of consideration. Yet we should not treat energy independently of other questions pertaining to raw materials  development and finance; for all these questions form together the foundations of the new international economic order  and none of them can be treated separately from the others in the interest of a specific group of States. The Secretary-General's proposal requires an international study so that we can determine the best means to achieve its objectives.134.	The achievement of international peace and security depends on the attainment of economic equity and the prevention of manipulation and monopoly. The peace to which the world aspires cannot be reached as long as part of the world is becoming poorer day after day while the other part is growing rich at the expense of the poor. The achievement of economic equity and prosperity is the responsibility of all peoples and not only those of the third world. This includes the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  whose members exercise their legitimate rights over their own natural resources. World inflation is not caused by the exploitation by the peoples of the third world of their own natural resources for their own benefit  but rather by foreign monopolies and by the capitalist system itself.135.	The responsibility for the achievement of world economic prosperity should be borne by all  and particularly by the capitalist industrial nations  which should give up some of the privileges they enjoy and should participate with other nations in attaining international economic prosperity. These nations should assist the poor countries of the third world  whose natural resources they regrettably continue to exploit.136.	The nations of the third world have realized the importance of co-operation within their own ranks. Perhaps Arab-African co-operation represents the comer-stone of this new development policy. The Arab nation and Africa constitute one historical  geographical  political and social region. They are bound by a common destiny and common hopes. On this basis  therefore  Arab-African co-operation has become a reality: a political reality in the joint struggle against racism in Africa and in the Arab nation; an economic reality in the bilateral and multilateral context. The Cairo Declaration represents an important  historic turning-point in the history of Africa and of the Arab nation-indeed  in the history of all mankind. I must also take this opportunity to refer to the Arab- European dialogue  which has begun to make positive progress in the common interest of the peoples of Europe and of the Arab nation. We attach great importance to this kind of co-operation between those two groups.137.	The proposal of my delegation at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly regarding the mines planted in some countries  including my own  by the belligerents in the Second World War  has raised many important facts in relation to the adverse effects of the material remnants of war  particularly that may have harmful and lasting effects on people and on the animal population  create a danger to the environment and disrupt the economic and social development of many developing countries.138.	The report of the Secretary-General prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3435 of 9 December 1975 and resolution 111 of 16 December 1976 contains important facts stressing the danger of the material remnants of war  particularly mines  on the international community and the need for measures to solve this problem and to prevent its recurrence in the future. In chapter II  the report deals with the dangers of remnants of war for the environment  human beings  animals and marine life and describes how the presence of this debris has impeded certain essential activities in a number of countries  particularly in the area of the exploration for and the utilization of mineral resources and the implementation of agricultural development plans.139.	The responses of States to the questionnaire on this problem sent out by the Secretary-General clearly indicate that this problem is not the problem of one specific country  as some have insisted  but a problem faced by many countries; hence  the recommendation made in the report of the Executive Director of UNEP that the States responsible for the existence of material remnants of war should make available to the affected countries  through bilateral or collective arrangements  all information that might be of use in the treatment of the problem. He also pointed to the necessity of providing technical assistance  through UNEP  to the affected countries in order to assist them in the preparation of programmes for the removal of the mines and in making further studies of the problem.140.	While we welcome the report prepared by the Secretary-General pursuance of General Assembly resolution 3435  we feel there is an urgent need for an intergovernmental conference to consider the various aspects of this problem and to reach specific conclusions with regard to its solution. Therefore  my delegation requests the Executive Director of UNEP to continue consultations with various States on the possibility of convening such a conference.141.	Our commitment to human rights stems from our religion  which provides that all peoples should enjoy prosperity and well-being on an equal footing  and that they all have equal rights and duties  because man is the supreme creation of God. As the Holy Koran says:""We have honoured the sons Of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea: Given them for sustenance things Good and pure: and conferred on them special favours. Above a great part of our Creation.""142.	Our commitment to political and social human rights stems also from our commitment to the principles of the United Nations  as well as from our deep faith in the principles of our Sharia  the sublime law of Islam  which provides a firm basis for the various freedoms. To those rights we direct our careful attention because they are the primary preoccupation of the present age. Consequently  we deplore any infringement of them  particularly imprisonment without trial  suppression of free speech  and torture in all its forms. As the Prophet of Islam-peace be upon him! -said: ""Allah will torture in the hereafter those who torture others in this world.""143.	Our interest in human rights extends to a concern for a sector of the population which  because of mental or physical disability  is unable to provide for itself  either socially or individually. I refer to the disabled.144.	The delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya welcomes the attention attracted by the proposal which it put forward during the last session and which bore fruit in resolution 31/123 of 16 December 1976  in which the General Assembly proclaimed 1981 International Year for Disabled Persons. That proves the importance of this humanitarian question.145.	The question of human rights is a moral issue that is indivisible. It is unacceptable that mankind can have rights in one country and no rights in another. We in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya were therefore very pleased by the initiative taken by the President of the United States  Mr. Carter  on the question of human rights  because it was in complete agreement with fundamental humanitarian and Islamic principles. Later  however  we realized that the purpose of the President's initiative in regard to human rights was solely political  for after he had stated his support for human rights everywhere  it became apparent that he was making exceptions in the case of certain areas that are bound to the United States by strategic ties. Human rights in Palestine  Zimbabwe and Namibia are no different from those in any other place-in Europe  the United States or elsewhere—unless the imperialists consider that African and Arab human beings are subhuman. That is something totally different.146.	The delegation of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reaffirms its adherence to the spirit and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and its commitment to contribute to the elimination of tensions  the preservation of peace and the achievement of liberty. We are confident that this session will represent another step towards that end. We shall participate with all delegations in the cause of achieving success  with God's help  in the service of all humanity and in the cause of achieving peace  prosperity  justice  freedom  dignity  and the elimination of Zionism  racism and colonialism.147.	May God bless our endeavours  in the interest of all humanity. "
"76",4149,"LKA",32,1977,"﻿ I wish to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty- second session of the General Assembly. You bring to the office a wealth of experience in international affairs  high competence and familiarity with the work and procedures of the United Nations. Your election is also a tribute to the great esteem in which your country  Yugoslavia  is held. Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia have very close relations  both bilaterally and in the non-aligned movement  and we are therefore particularly gratified by your election.1.	May I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our outgoing President  Ambassador Amerasinghe. It is with a sense of pride that  as a fellow Sri Lankan  I have heard other speakers here make mention of the acknowledged competence with which he guided the meetings of the previous session of the General Assembly.2.	Our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has been a source of great strength to the United Nations by his contribution in guiding this Organization successfully through difficult times. I should like to express our deep appreciation of the role he has played in enhancing the prestige of the United Nations and in strengthening its effectiveness in the cause of peace and international co-operation.3.	Early this year the death occurred of an eminent jurist and diplomat who served with ability and distinction as President of one of the most historic sessions of the General Assembly-the anniversary session of 1975. I refer to Mr. Edvard Hambro  who served the international community well. I take this opportunity  on behalf of my Government and the Sri Lanka delegation  as well as on my own behalf  to pay a tribute to his memory in recognition of his invaluable services in the sphere of international relations  by which he maintained a proud family tradition.4.	Sri Lanka has great pleasure is welcoming Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as new Members of thisOrganisation. The admission of those two States is fully in accord with the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations. We are confident that they will play a constructive and valuable role in our common efforts to promote the purposes of the United Nations.5.	It is my privilege to be here as Foreign Minister representing a Government which was elected by a majority unprecedented in the parliamentary history of Sri Lanka and perhaps in any other part of the world. It is the fervent hope of my Prime Minister and the Government to use this mandate as an instrument to establish a Dharmija Samajaya— fair  just and socialist society. I bring the greetings and good wishes of my Prime Minister  Mr. J. R. Jayewardena  for the success of this General Assembly session.6.	Sri Lanka is a democratic society  and the recent general election held there has reaffirmed the commitment of its people to the democratic process. Sri Lanka lays the highest emphasis on individual human freedom and on social justice and equality. These values are a happy amalgam of Sri Lanka's cultural tradition of more than 2 000 years and the liberal humanist tradition of the West. By its faith in these values the Government of Sri Lanka has set itself the task of creating a new society in which the interests of the common man would be paramount.7.	The present Government will follow an independent foreign policy which will be opposed to imperialism and colonialism in all their manifestations and will seek to preserve and protect the sovereignty  integrity and freedom of Sri Lanka. The Government will not permit any interference by foreign countries in internal or external affairs or allow the independence or security of the country to be threatened in any way. The Government is fully committed to the purposes of the United Nations and its agencies. It also has a special commitment to contribute  to the limit of its capacity  to the realization of the new international economic order.8.	Before dealing with some of the major issues under consideration by this Assembly  I should like to make some observations on the seeming inability of the international community to grapple with some of the major problems which have been confronting the world. It suffices in this connexion to mention the question of disarmament  the problems of the Middle East and southern Africa and the continuing economic problems of the third world.9.	The United National Party  which at present constitutes the Government in . Sri Lanka  has always had a commitment to the principles of non-alignment  first manifested at an international forum at the African-Asian Conference  held at Bandung in 1955  at which  in the words used by the Political Declaration adopted by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Colombo in August 1976   the concept of non-alignment itself was given concrete expression . It is our view that the principles of non-alignment  which are fully consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter  are necessary for the realization of a satisfactory international economic  social and political order. However  the non-aligned movement could make a worth-while contribution to the evolution of such an international order only so long as it remains true to its own principles. It will therefore be the special endeavour of my Government to ensure that the non-aligned movement is not deflected from its proper path and retains its true character as a decisive force shaping the international order of the future.10.	We place special emphasis on the problems of Africa  as it appears that international rivalry is most intensely focused today on that continent. While southern Africa has long been and remains the area of crisis  turmoil has seized other regions of that continent. This turmoil is not just the outcome of local dissension amongst the countries of Africa  but rather the consequence of interest  if not intervention  on the part of outside Powers.11.	In South Africa  the massacres of last year in Soweto and elsewhere and the harsher repressive measures taken against the black population provided a continuing momentum for opposition to apartheid. But  that same repression sows the seeds of destruction of the evil and inhuman system. Outside South Africa  the more heartening picture is the changing attitude of some countries  hitherto silent or apologetic  but now more critical of the apartheid policies of the South African regime. Nevertheless  the South African regime shows no disposition to dismantle the apparatus of discrimination and repression built into the system of apartheid  and doggedly persists in its defiance of the international community.12.	In regard to Namibia  there has been no significant progress towards the granting of independence. Our position is that no solution is acceptable to the international community without the participation of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  which is the sole and authentic representative of the people of Namibia.13.	We welcome the recognition of the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe by the front-line States and the Organization of African Unity as a notable development towards a solution of the Rhodesian problem. We have to take note also of the active interest of the United States and the United Kingdom in renewing the efforts to bring about a solution of the problem. The latest proposals have yet to gain the acceptance of the nationalist leaders inside Zimbabwe  the front-line States and the Organization of African Unity. We shall continue to watch these developments closely. But may I say that Ian Smith should be left in no doubt that he cannot rely  as he has done during the last 12 years  on the support of outside Powers to sustain his regime and to deny to the black majority their legitimate rights  which form the core of the Anglo-United States proposals.May I now turn to the problem of the Middle East  which is again moving towards a dangerous conflict. We cannot allow this to happen without exposing the world to the risk of a massive conflagration. I urge those at the helm of affairs in Israel to end their recalcitrance and heed the voice of world opinion as manifested in the resolutions and declarations of the United Nations. I also appeal to those countries which have the undoubted capacity to influence Israeli thinking to prevail upon it to honour its obligations under the Charter and join the other nations of the world in the common task of building a peaceful world and a fair and just international order.16.	The international community cannot condone the continued occupation by Israel of the Arab territories which it seized during the June 1967 war. Nor can it tolerate the policy deliberately adopted and vigorously pursued by Israel  ever since the occupation  of altering the political  demographic  cultural and historical character of these territories. The annexationist designs of Israel have become even more blatant in recent weeks by the establishment of  ore settlements in the West Bank area  which obviously calls for strong and effective measures by the international community  as they constitute a further violation of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force is an incontestable and well-established principle of international law.17.	An enduring peace in the Middle East will not be achieved without a just and equitable solution of the Palestinian problem. We remain firmly committed to the full restitution of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as set out in the relevant resolutions of the non-aligned countries on the subject  and particularly the resolution adopted at the Conference held in Colombo in August 1976.218.	Sri Lanka has a special interest in the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  in regard to which there has unfortunately been no worth-while progress since its adoption in 1971 . We are all aware that the great Powers have been engaged in negotiations on the Indian Ocean. Certainly Sri Lanka would welcome any understanding on their part to prevent the escalation of rivalries as a preliminary step towards their total elimination  as that would be consistent with the purposes of the Declaration. On the other hand  a delimitation of spheres of influence in the Indian Ocean aimed at achieving a balance between the great Powers  which can only be provisional and precarious  would be contrary to the purposes of the Declaration. At this stage  we appeal to the great Powers and the major maritime users to co-operate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  which has as its immediate purpose the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean.19.	In our view  the concept of a peace zone in the Indian Ocean requires not only the elimination of great Power rivalry in the area  but also an obligation on the part of the regional Powers to observe restraint and act in the interests of peace. It might be useful to emphasize that this conception has been fundamental to Sri Lanka's thinkingfrom the very inception of the efforts to take international action towards the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. This was amplified in the memorandum presented by Sri Lanka to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference held in Singapore from 14 to 22 January 1971-where action was initiated preparatory to the introduction of the Declaration at the United Nations- which contained the following statement: A parallel corollary of a peace zone is that regional States bordering the Indian Ocean will themselves refrain from action prejudicial to the concept of a peace zone. Their defence requirements therefore would have to be measured against their obligations not to compromise the concept of a peace zone. 20.	On the question of disarmament there has been a mountain of documents which  unfortunately  has not generated any really significant disarmament measures. We realize that our objective of achieving general and complete disarmament cannot be implemented forthwith or in the near future by fiat. But what is disheartening is that the very limited progress made towards disarmament is hardly commensurate with the efforts made so far. On the contrary  in the process our goal of general and complete disarmament has become even more distant as a result of the multiplication of newer and more horrifying weapons. Even while the argument was between the cruise missile and the backfire bomber  the neutron bomb has entered the stage. This last weapon is viewed with special horror sis it is aimed at the destruction of human beings while preserving the material edifice of human society. What is of particular concern to countries of the third world such as ours is that current expenditure on armaments is estimated at $300 billion a year. Only a fraction of that sum could do much to alleviate the problems of poverty  hunger and disease which continue to plague the third world.21.	The Colombo Conference of non-aligned nations last year decided to seek a special session on disarmament and this  approved by the last session of the General Assembly  is scheduled :o be held in May and June 1978. The non-aligned nations that have played their part will continue to do so  and it is our hope that the great Powers will extend their co-operation in making the special session a success.22.	Sri Lanka has a democratic system of government and the longest record in Asia for universal franchise  which has been exercised for almost five decades. In accordance with this democratic orientation Sri Lanka is committed to unqualified respect for human rights and it is the constant endeavour of our Government to uphold them. We therefore have a special interest in the gathering momentum for the realization of human rights embodied in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I must  however  stress that without economic rights  human rights have no meaning whatsoever. It is our hope that in the deliberations at this session a constructive approach will be adopted to the advancement of human rights.23.	I now pass to the sphere of international economic relations. If the democratic freedoms which we cherish are to be preserved  it is vital that the anomalies which characterize the differential treatment of developing as compared to developed countries in current economic theory and practice be eliminated.24.	Let me illustrate the point by referring to a few of the more glaring anomalies. When a rich country falls into balance-of-payments difficulties as a result of a sharp increase in import prices as has happened recently  safety nets of all kinds are designed to cushion it. No similar flexibility exists for developing countries. Another anomaly is that  while developing countries are encouraged in the name of self-help to develop production for export of those non-traditional commodities which are not exposed to volatile export prices  the access of those new exports to markets has a habit of drying up as soon as developing countries acquire a comparative advantage and a degree of competitive efficiency in their products. While we appreciate the difficulties of developed countries and the resulting market disruption and unemployment problems  there is an irrefutable case for a medium-term programme of structural adjustment in the economies of developed countries to accommodate developing-country exports in a phased fashion. Certainly  we in Sri Lanka are aware of the fact that certain countries are actively pursuing such measures and transplanting appropriate industries to developing countries. We welcome this trend.25.	To my mind  there is a case in regard to these issues for a greater effort at leap-frogging over the immediate questions on which the North-South dialogue has so far concentrated with limited success. This should be done without in any way relaxing the pressures for resolving  on terms satisfactory to developing countries  those issues that are currently on the negotiating table  by taking a long hard look at the structural changes required within the world economy in the 1980s and in its  rule book  in the light of recent developments.26.	As my country sees it  it is the economic dimension of non-alignment which must be paramount and which helps to knit together the entire Group of 77 on a wide range of economic issues. In this context  I expect to place before the Assembly certain specific proposals designed to ensure that the export development which I have mentioned and which all developing countries are currently being encouraged to undertake takes place under propitious conditions so far as all parties are concerned.27.	First  there will have to be satisfactory arrangements in regard to. primary commodities  to encourage orderly investment. We see the common fund as the key element in the programme of UNCTAD for an integrated approach to the commodity problem  which we endorse. While we note that an agreement in principle was reached on the common fund at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  we would also like to make sure that the fund that eventually results is of the kind that will support commodity markets on a broad basis at times of falling prices and  therefore  act as a catalyst in permitting the conclusion on equitable terms of many more commodity agreements than have been concluded in the past.18428.	Secondly  an important element in promoting export development involving foreign investment concerns ways of insuring against non-commercial risks. Proposals for an international investment insurance agency have been discussed for several years in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank and more recently in the Development Assistance Committee. The scheme has failed to command agreement for a variety of reasons. On the one hand  host countries have always entertained fears about intervention  through the arbitration of an international body  on matters concerning national sovereignty. On the other hand  some circles fear that the establishment of international investment insurance for non-commercial risks might constitute an encouragement to expropriation. In order to meet these views  many key developed countries  the United States  the Federal Republic of Germany  France  Japan and the United Kingdom among others  have developed purely national investment insurance facilities covering the risks of expropriation and so forth. No insurance  of course  is provided in these cases against the commercial risks of investment.29.	These national insurance arrangements are frequently complemented by bilateral agreements with interested host countries defining their mutual legal obligations with provisions for the settlement of investment disputes. However  looked at internationally  this combination of facilities and agreements has certain built-in advantages to investors from the larger countries which have a long tradition of foreign investment and the resources to mount a national operation. On the other hand  the present framework of bilateral arrangements places at a disadvantage those smaller developed countries  in particular  which find it difficult to organize adequate national insurance facilities but whose investments many developing countries will welcome on a commercial basis and which have in addition by and large supported third-world causes in many forums. An international investment insurance arrangement would obviously provide a very attractive source of support to smaller investing countries but it is  as mentioned earlier  open to the objections which have frustrated its acceptance so far.30.	The solution to this dilemma which I should like tentatively to propose to the Assembly runs as follows. Existing national insurance agencies in developed countries could pool their risks through a reinsurance agency that might be set up on a multilateral basis. The savings resulting from the pooling of risks in this manner might encourage those smaller developed countries that have hitherto failed to secure international agreement for a multilateral investment insurance agency to set up their own national insurance facilities on an adequate basis. Developing countries  and of course only those countries that are interested in joining such an arrangement on a voluntary basis  might pick up some part of the reinsurance risk to the extent feasible. At the same time the whole arrangement can be given an  international umbrella  through an enlargement of the guarantee powers of the World Bank Group. In other words  the proposal I am making is an evolutionary one which seeks to build on existing arrangements to meet the legitimate aspirations of the smaller developed countries while at the same time keeping the developing countries' contribution within affordable limits by having recourse to these enlarged guarantee powers.31.	Thirdly  let me now turn to a proposal which covers a substantial area of commercial risks  that of exploration in the field of minerals and energy  where potential private investors are understandably reluctant to assume the very high risks of failure they face without an assurance of a reasonable return on their capital out of the profits that would invariably result to the host country from a successful exploration venture. It has been all too common  in fact  for countries to aggravate this reluctance by unilaterally revising the terms of any exploration agreement to the disadvantage of the investor in the event of a successful  find . This again is an area where progress can be made on a similar evolutionary basis. The World Bank  under the auspices of the Development Assistance Committee  is considering proposals whereby it would lend Governments sums for exploration ventures  whereas at the moment it is limited to financing exploitation alone. With the international community involved in this area  under suitable auspices  this would ensure that the terms applicable to all the parties concerned are reasonable and that the obligations between the government and the enterprise concerned are adhered to  again of reasonable terms. A set of international arrangements that satisfies the mutual interest of all parties concerned would promote investment  which is now lagging in necessary areas.32.	There is  in this context  a particular role for the United Nations Revolving Fund for Natural Resources Exploration to play  a role which involves the relaxation of its current onerous terms and includes also an element of subsidy. It would be necessary for contributions to this Fund  which now stand at $7 million  to be substantially increased as an arrangement along these lines permits increased use of the funds now available. It would also be necessary to have the work of the United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations and of UNCTAD drawn upon so as to ensure adequate codes of conduct for the transfer of technology and for ensuring a reasonable return to the investor on terms that host countries can live with. Once again my delegation will co-operate with others in framing an appropriate draft resolution in the relevant committee.33.	These proposals I have made are of international interest  but I should not disguise the fact that they will help accomplish a transformation of Sri Lanka  while at the same time preserving the best elements of Sri Lanka's traditional commitment to meeting basic human needs and human aspirations  a policy combining rapid growth with social justice. Sri Lanka  as you are aware  has pursued policies which have  over the years  achieved a life expectancy of 68 years  a literacy rate of 81 per cent and an infant mortality rate of 45 per 1 000  rates which compare very favorably with those of many developed countries which have a per capita gross national product considerably higher than Sri Lanka. Concealed within these averages  however  is a significant deterioration  particularly since 1973  in these standards  affecting certain populous parts of the country.34.	What Sri Lanka's recent experience outlines is the need to implement the basic human needs strategy which the ILO world employment Conference endorsed last year   and which many governments represented here have endorsed in various other forums. As I understand it  this strategy seeks an international commitment to maintaining and establishing certain minimum human needs at a time when countries like Sri Lanka  despite the areas of flexibility recently introduced  are under pressure to abandon these standards. I should emphasize that no one owes a country like Sri Lanka a living. All that we can legitimately expect is an adequate degree of support and a sufficiently long period of time within which to effect the necessary domestic adjustments. All we seek is an adequate volume of essentially bridging support from the outside world and this will involve without doubt a revision of the present rules of the game so as to guarantee the minimum basic needs of the largely unemployed poor living in developing countries. Any programme of adjustment must take into account both the social and economic realities of countries like Sri Lanka without at the same time impairing work incentives during the interim period that must inevitably elapse before the necessary corrective policies can begin to yield tangible results in terms of growth and employment.35.	Finally  in the economic sphere I turn to the question of regional co-operation which can  under suitable conditions  evolve in the direction of an Asian common market. Those of us who come from Asia cannot fail to be struck by the fact that many countries in different regions of the world have found that the way to ensure economic advancement is by the device of regional co-operation. We are pleased that institutional arrangements are already available in the region for such co-operation in certain specific fields. This will of course have to evolve alongside a political willingness to co-operate among the nations concerned.36.	As I have already mentioned  my Prime Minister  Mr. J. R. Jayewardena  has proclaimed building a Dharmista Samajaya  which also implies the equalization of opportunities. We see this as meaning a commitment to redistributive social justice and a protection of the basic human needs of the bottom 40 per cent of our society. It also implies a liberal framework of incentives within which the social product can expand rapidly enough to emancipate us from dependence on aid except during a transitional period. And finally it implies a society where both these developments are consistent with an absence of the extremes of inequality and of conspicuous elite consumption. It is only on this basis that a viable social fabric can hold together within a socialist democracy. International politics as symbolized by those who worked out the United Nations framework at Lake Success and on the strengthening of its economic arm at Bretton Woods was not entirely a game of real-politik it was imbued with a spirit of what 1 can only call practical idealism. Those men who sought to shape a new world in the late 1940s were both eminently of this world and also outside it. What we have to reconstruct today is that combination of the practical and the ideal which is now required to serve the interests of the world community in a totally different situation. We must  in other words  go beyond what the founding fathers of the United Nations system had in mind. The task today is to work towards a world in which idealism  if it does not transcend the requirement of practicability  is not unduly limited by it. We should strive towards the outer edge of the possible of which reasonable men can be convinced by reasoned argument. To say this alone may seem to be idealistic but unless international thinking flows in these currents our  planet earth  may well run the risk of disappearing into a  black hole  which collapses into itself under the gravity of its own inertia.

"77",4193,"LSO",32,1977,"﻿41.	 Mr. President  it is a signal honour and a most singular pleasure for me to extend to you my delegation's congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your qualifications for this high office need no testimony. In the performance of your duties on behalf of your country and of this Organization you have displayed such sterling qualities that I am confident that under your leadership the deliberations of this Assembly will produce concrete results.42.	Yugoslavia and my own country enjoy the most fraternal and cordial relations and I should like to pledge my delegation's support to you and to the officers of the Assembly in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities. I should also like to express from this podium my Government's appreciation to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the efficiency which has become the hallmark of his performance of his duties as Secretary-General. His years at the head of the United Nations have been characterized by dedication  competence and an unremitting sensitivity to the urgent need to solve pressing international problems.43.	My delegation is not unmindful of the contribution that your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  made to the deliberations of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. The manner in which Mr. Amerasinghe conducted the work of that session deserves a word of thanks from all of us. We are confident that he will continue to discharge his duties skilfully as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.44.	We should also like to express our congratulations to the new Members of our Organization  Djibouti and Viet Nam. We are confident that this Organization will benefit from their membership.45.	The agenda of this Assembly reflects a simple but horrifying truth. That truth is that every step towards the end of the twentieth century is accompanied by the emergence of new problems that threaten the security and peace of mankind  problems that confront humanity with new and frightful challenges.46.	Technology has opened fresh vistas for the development of civilization. It has also presented unprecedented threats to the existence of that civilization. Thanks to advances in technology and humanity's weaknesses peace today hangs on the delicate and precarious thread of a balance of terror. The resources of States Members of this Organization still continue to be devoted  not to the interests and the betterment of the human conditions  but to a threat to human existence. Billions of dollars are being expended  not on the promise of eradicating poverty  disease and ignorance  but on making the bare survival of the human species more uncertain.47.	Even more alarming is the fact that States which have demonstrated their contempt of every principle of international morality and international law are ushering in a nightmare era of nuclear-weapon proliferation. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by these States confronts this Organization with yet another set of problems which must be tackled with the urgency that it deserves. These problems should cause serious concern to every State that takes its obligations under the Charter seriously.48.	Once more the problems of southern Africa  of the disparities in the wealth of the rich and the poor and of the Middle East feature prominently 9n the agenda of this session of the Assembly. There is a no more serious indictment of this Organization than the continued denial of legitimate rights to the people of Palestine and of the livelihood of the vast majority of humanity in conditions that the President of the World Bank has described as ""defying any rational definition of human decency"". The urgency of solving these problems has never become more imperative. We owe it to humanity to do something meaningful. We need to take action that is more effective than adopting resolutions which gather dust on the shelves of history. At stake is the fabric of an orderly international climate. That climate cannot be bequeathed to posterity on a platter. States Members of this Organization must display a willingness to make political sacrifices and to demonstrate meaningful political will.49.	My Government has always deplored any action to change the social  economic or political topography of the Arab lands conquered by Israel. The recent actions of the Government of Israel in encouraging Jewish settlements on conquered Arab territory have once more underlined the critical urgency of the need for a Middle East settlement.50.	My Government deplores these actions by the Government of Israel as unhelpful and unnecessarily provocative. We do not accept the fait accompli of conquered lands. The Government of Lesotho has on numerous occasions made clear its commitment to the right of Israel to existence. We shall not depart from that commitment. And yet we cannot agree to the proposition that that right constitutes a carte blanche for the illegal occupation of conquered territory. The right to perceive security interests is no basis for the denial of the rights of the people of Palestine nor the refusal to return lands acquired in battle. I should like to appeal to Israel and all other parties involved to implement Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and all other resolutions of this Organization in their entirety. The right to existence of the State of Israel does not cancel the rights of the other peoples in the Middle East. In this connexion my Government urges the Government of Israel to recognize the imperative need for the representation of the people of Palestine at the Geneva talks. I am hopeful that the Government of Israel will go further and agree to the direct involvement in the Geneva talks of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Conquest of territory cannot  under any circumstances  confer any right of permanency.51.	The establishment of a ski resort on the territory of Lesotho at Khoptjoane is clearly intended to alienate more of our land  and the refusal of South Africa to negotiate with the Government of Lesotho on the question of our joint boundaries is both unjust and a source of tension. Worse still is the fact that South Africa is complicating this whole issue by the establishment of Bantustans on our borders. The creation of these Bantustans on land that belongs to the Basotho nation is a most irresponsible act. On the south-eastern border of Lesotho  the Transkei Bantustan occupies part of the territory of Lesotho. On the north-western sector of the Lesotho frontier  the Qwaqwa Bantustan is already being constructed on the land of Lesotho. On the western sector yet another Bantustan  Bophuthatswana  has been created. The territory of Lesotho stretches all the way from Matatiele and Herschel in the Transkei Bantustan to the eastern Orange Free State  where the Bophuthatswana Bantustan has been established. South Africa is arrogantly continuing to include these lands in its Bantustan arrangements with a view to exacerbating the tensions in southern Africa. The intention is clear; the signs are unmistakable that South Africa is creating Bantustans on our lands in all sectors of our common frontiers in an effort to strangle my country.52.	One hundred and fifty years ago the founder of the Basotho nation  King Moshoeshoe I  said in reference to the unjust and illegal boundary arrangements that were imposed on Lesotho by the former British colonial administration that  in his opinion  nothing had contributed more to racial disharmony in the past years than this single factor-the Warden Line. He considered it unfair  entirely impracticable and an affront to the Basotho. The persistent refusal by South Africa to deal in a spirit of neighbourliness with the question of our lands is bound to sour the relations between the people of Lesotho and South Africa for the foreseeable future; for no generation of Basotho is going to forget my country's just claims. What  after all  is Pretoria afraid of? Is it the risk of arbitration? Is its case so patently weak that it cannot stand up to proposals for a joint boundary commission to settle the question of these lands? We  for our part  are prepared to abide by a decision based on law. We are prepared to assist in shortening the agenda of southern Africa problems. We are prepared to avoid confrontation and to seek peaceful solutions to our problems. But we are not prepared to become orphans of colonialism and unequal treaties and a victim of apartheid.53.	In his report the Secretary-General has rightly recognized that ""the unresolved problems of southern Africa have this year commanded as much  or more  attention than any others. The Maputo and Lagos Declarations3 are ample testimony to that fact. The fact that the Smith rebellion continues to exist; the fact of South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia; the fact of the continuation of apartheid in South Africa-these are so only because some Member States are still putting a higher priority and a greater premium on their narrow sectional interests than on the interests of the majority of the people of southern Africa 54.	My Government has taken note of the joint United States and United Kingdom initiatives on Rhodesia. We have studied the proposals that have been submitted to the Smith regime and the Zimbabwe liberation movements. We know of Smith's well-known perversity. His entrust- worthiness is a matter of public record. We do not  however  regard the Anglo-American proposals as completely satisfactory. In the view of my Government  the people of Zimbabwe deserve independence now. For Zimbabweans who have suffered oppression for scores of years  the simple test is whether the majority actually assumes power and whether Britain is now seriously committed to decolonizing Zimbabwe. The people have demonstrated by their sacrifices that the right to majority rule in Zimbabwe is their birth right. They and they alone are responsible for the current attempts at a settlement. We cannot forget that all other previous attempts have aborted because of the lack of a concrete commitment by the United Kingdom to enforcing its proposals. My Government thus attaches particular importance to article 10 of the Anglo-American proposals. It is the sincere hope of my Government that the United Kingdom and the United States Governments will carry out their obligations in terms of that article if Smith and his clique fail to honour the terms of the proposals.55.	My Government has also followed with interest the initiatives of the five Western Powers on the question of Namibia. I have previously made clear my Government's rejections of the Turnhalle solution which the Government of South Africa was trying to impose on Namibia. In our view  SWAPO remains the authentic and legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.56.	The initiatives of the five Western Powers  members of the Security Council  are nevertheless not far-reaching enough. In particular they have put a gloss of legality on South Africa's illegal occupation of that Territory in disregard of the resolutions of this Organization. The authority of the United Nations over Namibia is compromised in these proposals  and the authority of South Africa is conceded. The role of the Administrator-General appointed by Pretoria should be clearly limited; and the role of the representative of the United Nations Secretary- General should be clearly defined. The army of the Pretoria regime will continue to pose a threat to the liberation struggle in Namibia. It is clear  too  that the Pretoria regime hopes to limit the ability of SWAPO to participate fully in the electoral process. Despite these serious limitations  my Government is confident that the machinations of the Government of South Africa will fail and that the struggle of the people of Namibia will succeed.57.	The dismemberment of Namibian territory by the amputation of Walvis Bay is unacceptable to my Government. Any previous arrangements incorporating the area into South Africa should not constitute the legal basis for South Africa's refusal to include the area in the independent Namibia which is now imminent. This would constitute a violation of the territorial integrity of Namibia and forever remain a source of tension in the area. If Mr. Vorster were serious on the Namibia issue  he would not have any previous arrangements incorporating the area into South Africa should not constitute the legal basis for South Africa's refusal to include the area in the independent Namibia which is now imminent. This would constitute a violation of the territorial integrity of Namibia and forever remain a source of tension in the area. If Mr. Vorster were serious on the Namibia issue  he would not have come up with such a provocative suggestion. SWAPO will reject it and the struggle over it will continue.58.	In the security debates on the question of South Africa at the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo  and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos  my delegation made it clear that in our view the main cause of the problems of southern Africa in the apartheid policies of that Government which resulted in the closure of the south-eastern borders with my country. It is the same obnoxious policies which envisage the creation of Botswana and QwaQwa Bantustans around Lesotho. It is apartheid that denies basic freedoms to over 20 million Africans in South Africa. It is apartheid that catapults thousands of black South Africans into fleeing their country for political refuge in Lesotho. The Government and people of Lesotho have maintained a flexible policy of purposefully absorbing the fleeing refugees and integrating them into the fabric of our society rather than treating them as conventional refugees. It is the same apartheid policies that permit detentions without trial in South Africa. In pursuit of this policy  several Basotho people are either held hostage or detained in South Africa without access to judicial due process.59.	The international community has recently been served with a painful reminder of the callous inhumanity of apartheid when the spokesman of the apartheid regime scoffed at the deaths of detainees and gloated with dispassionate insensitivity at the death of Steven Bantu Biko. These are the words of the South African Minister of Police when confronted on Biko's death: ""I am not glad and I am not sorry ; he leaves me cold. I can say nothing to you"". Such is the inhuman coldness of apartheid towards the black majority of Africans. Such is the unbelievable system of justice in South Africa. To the blacks in South Africa the death of Steven Biko is a great loss. In this mysterious death my Government sees a continuing selective process aimed at eliminating opponents of apartheid. Nothing  however  will deter the struggle; success is guaranteed.60.	It is racism that sanctions the deaths of schoolchildren in Soweto  Langa and Mamelodi. The quality of life has so deteriorated in Soweto that it is no longer a place to live in  but has become a prison without walls; it is a place permanently patrolled by police troops-a case  in fact  of policy versus the people. Thousands of Soweto high-school children are out of school while more than 400 teachers have resigned since Soweto high schools were placed under direct jurisdiction of the white administration.61.	The arbitrary detentions of students continue and their harassment by the apartheid police is becoming a pattern of life. As of 16 August this year  11 more members of the Soweto Students Representative Council have joined- hundreds of other students in South African goals. And yet the students are not daunted. They continue to express their profound objection to apartheid and to Bantu education. I should like to take this opportunity to commend the students of Soweto  and indeed of all other townships  for their salutary contribution to the liberation struggle. I feel compelled  however  to bring to the notice of this Assembly the serious plight of the detained students  who include nationals of my own country.62.	As I stated before  to be black in South Africa is to live in a twilight of terror; to be dehumanized; to live in perpetual fear of loss of liberty and life; to live in endless danger of unemployment; to live in fear of being sent to gaol-in short  to live without rights  for even in gaol there is no safety. Since 1963 over 37 detainees held in South African gaols have lost their lives under mysterious circumstances. In only two instances has the South African Government admitted culpability. The other deaths have simply been dismissed as unavoidable. The death toll over the past 17 months alone stands at 16. And yet all demands for explanations of the deaths of the detainees are continuing to meet with deafening silence. A few months ago Mr. Mzizi was found hanged from a cell window. Before him on 3 August  it was Dr. Haffejee who met a similar fate. With each death our concern for detainees must deepen and the urgency of action must increase.63.	Pretoria pretends that its security police are gentle souls who would not dream of hurting a fly  let alone a political detainee. And yet even a South African judge was compelled to observe  with regard to the death on 19 March 1976 of detainee Mr. Mdluli: ""The most probable explanation is that all or most of the wounds were inflicted by the security police."" The United Nations has already responded generously to the plight of students who fled South Africa. It must now pronounce itself most clearly and in terms of action on those who are in detention. Month in and month out news of arrests under the detention laws reaches the outside world. There are no announcements and no explanations from Pretoria; Pretoria does not regard itself as obliged to give any. People simply disappear inside the gaols of South Africa  in solitary confinement. Some are lucky to reappear after 200 days. Others are less fortunate. Mr. Phantsi was held for 513 days in solitary confinement and then inexplicably released with no apology  no explanation. No one knows how many more are sharing a similar fate. Comfort has long dulled the sense of outrage of most whites in South Africa about their brutal injustice. The only hope for the detainees is action by the international community. It is no surprise to us that every effort by the Government of Lesotho to obtain the release of Lesotho nationals in South African gaols has met with suggestions that we should hand over South African refugees in exchange for the release of our nationals. Our reply has always been the same: ""Never"". And our record in getting back refugees kidnapped by South Africa speaks for itself.64.	The catalogue of outrageous acts against the African population does not end in the shadows of South African gaols or on Robben Island. In a non-racial service in Cape Town on 14 August 1977  the congregation was moved  in response to the evictions of persons and the demolition of their buildings  to observe:""...we urgently call upon the Government to stop forthwith the demolition of homes of people without providing them with alternative and adequate accommodations. We dedicate ourselves to work with our fellow South Africans for a society in which the rights of all people to live a secure family life in the place where they contribute to society by their work is firmly established.""This is an extraordinary statement from South Africa in response to the most perverse action yet taken by the twisted minds of the apartheid regime the destruction of the homes of Africans in Modderdam near Cape Town. Let me describe the demolition of those homes in the words of one South African newspaper:""The bulldozers began at the height of an exceptionally cold  wet  windy winter. It would have been a humiliating eviction in ideal weather. In the bitter winter it was downright inhuman. In exchange for their homes  the squatters were offered temporary canvas shelter and rail tickets to the Bantustans of Ciskei and Transkei-tickets to broken family lives and the prospects of no homes and no jobs.""65.	In yet another article  a South African newspaper described the agony of Africans from Hoek-fontein near Pretoria in these terms:""Thousands of people in the squatter camps  about 60 kilometres north of Pretoria  have become orphans of the Government apartheid system. They are living in appalling conditions and nobody wants to help them. The callousness of the Government in refusing to alleviate their plight is extraordinary. It is  after all  Government laws and policies which helped to create the whole mess in the first place.""66.	It is Pretoria that bolsters the Smith rebellion and that perpetuates the illegal occupation of Namibia. The solution of the problem of South Africa is the key to peace  stability and racial harmony in southern Africa. To ignore this fact and to attempt to isolate the problems of southern Africa is to turn one's back on reality and to raise false hopes.67.	Apartheid constitutes the single most flagrant violation of human rights and the most direct threat to the peace of southern Africa  and concrete action must be taken to rid southern Africa of it. The morality of such action is no longer in doubt. This Assembly has itself classified apartheid as a crime against humanity and a threat to international peace. What is now required is not further declarations' and resolutions  but concrete action.68.	Lesotho views with great concern another developing travesty of political justice which the minority racist regime is proposing in its so-called ""new constitution"" for South Africa. The Pretoria administration  with gloating insensitivity  is goading the South African Coloured and Indian population to join its national laager ritual of excluding the majority black Africans from exercising their inalienable political  economic  social and cultural rights in the land of their fathers and forefathers.69.	It is important to remember that this so-called constitutional dispensation is still part of the strategy of the evil philosophy of apartheid The proposed dispensation violates civilized political morality. It emasculates the human spirit as it brutalizes the psyche of the Africans. It violates as it vitiates the life expectations and aspirations of the black majority. Given this continued insensitivity of the minority racist regime after years of pleading and encouragement  the international community must be prepared to bear witness to a continued and intensified liberation struggle in South Africa until this ugly philosophy and its institutional superstructure are eradicated.70.	It has often been alleged that the majority of the people of southern Africa will be the major victims of any international action against the Pretoria regime. The experiences of my own country are a clear demonstration that there are no upper limits to the suffering that the racist regime is prepared to inflict on the people of South Africa. Citizens of Lesotho are detained in solitary confinement in South Africa. Throughout all the border posts connecting my country with South Africa  the people of my country suffer constant harassment and humiliation. With its plans to grant bogus independence to its Bophuthatswana Bantustan in December  the Pretoria regime is continuing with its designs to encircle my country with these bogus states in an effort to coerce my Government to grant recognition to its Bantustans. My delegation will elucidate fully in the deliberations of the Special Political Committee on incidents that show that there is no limit to the suffering of the black man. In the view of my Government  action by the United Nations to assist the people of southern Africa is long overdue. That action we owe to the people of southern Africa. We owe it to ourselves  too  in the name of morality and the conscience of mankind.71.	The Government of Lesotho firmly believes that the United Nations provides the most appropriate forum for the negotiation of concrete modalities for the establishment of a new international economic order. It is because of this that we attach so much importance to the ongoing process of restructuring the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system to enhance their capacity to respond effectively to the problems and most urgent needs  of the developing countries.72.	The record of the United Nations in the field of international economic relations has not been very encouraging. The targets of the Second United Nations Development Decade have not been met. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly still remain to be implemented. The recent Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation seems to have reached limited results. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has not produced conclusive results. As a result of the aforesaid developments  the rich countries are becoming richer and the poor ones are becoming poorer. There is no doubt in our minds that a solution to these problems would greatly facilitate social transformation  modernization and economic growth in all sectors of the economies of the developing countries  particularly of the least developed and of the land-locked countries among them.73.	Despite the short-comings of the United Nations system in responding effectively to the economic problems of the developing world and in ensuring a balanced international economic order  it would be less than just if I did not  from this podium  record the appreciation of my country for the prompt action that the United Nations took in response to the closure of the south-eastern borders of my country by the racist Government of South Africa. I should like to express the particular satisfaction of my country with Security Council resolutions 402(1976) and 407(1977)  General Assembly resolution 31/6  and Economic and Social Council resolution 2096 (LXII1). We are also grateful to the Secretary-General for sending his assistant  Mr. Farah  to consult with my Government on an effective international programme of assistance to Lesotho  and for his appeal to Member States to make contributions to the programme. Many Governments have responded generously to that appeal  and I should like to reiterate once more the sincere appreciation of Lesotho for this response.74.	The attitude of the United Nations system in response to our problems has given added hope to the peoples of southern Africa in their struggle against white minority rule and racism. It has also served as a clear warning to Pretoria and Salisbury that the international community has not lost its capacity to respond to threats to the peace and security of southern Africa.75.	Let me conclude by reassuring this Assembly that my Government will never give any comfort to the white minority regimes and that we shall continue  whatever difficulties are placed in our path  to respect and abide fully by the resolutions of the United Nations. "
"78",4261,"LUX",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  my first words are naturally addressed to you  Sir  in extending heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of this thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.2.	The excellent bilateral relations which my country maintains with Yugoslavia have already allowed me on many occasions to appreciate your talents  and the conviction which you bring to the noble task of bringing peoples together. Moreover your presidency once more reminds us of. the eminent role being played by your country in world affairs at this time when the meeting  o review the Conference on European Security and Co-operation is being held in Belgrade. I wish you  Mr. President  all the perseverance and patience which I know from personal experience you will sometimes need in the coming months.3.	I wish now to extend most sincere thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe. While so many other Presidents of the Assembly  including myself  have made brief ascents to this presidency  he is always  so to speak  President by vocation  because after having brilliantly conducted the debates of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  he assumed  and continues to fill  with admirable competence  the office of President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.4.	I should like now once more to assure our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  of the boundless trust and support of the Government of Luxembourg in his tireless efforts to eliminate hotbeds of tension and conflict threatening international peace and security. I am particularly pleased to see that during his mandate—indeed  his mandates—an increasing number have come to share the views which he has always expressed with courage and lucidity on strictly intergovernmental co-operation  and also on the imperative need to work together in organizations such as the United Nations. It is my most sincere wish that he will be able to continue to gather the fruits of his patient work for the good of humanity.5.	This year again our Organization has taken a major step towards the situation which I believe we all agree to be ideal of absolute universality. Djibouti and Viet Nam are now seated among us. My country sincerely welcomes this development  and extends to the new Members its unreserved co-operation in the search for our common goal-peace and good relations among all peoples.6.	At the time when each year we attempt to take stock of the world situation I had hoped  until the last moment  to be in a position to insert some note of optimism. Unfortunately  I think that once more our expectations and our hopes have been greatly disappointed. And yet the need  the urgent need  to advance towards compromise and the essential conciliations  is becoming more and more pressing. On the other hand  distinct possibilities for solutions can fortunately be discerned for almost all the dangerous situations. There is therefore still reason for hope  even though the solutions are not yet within our grasp. In spite of the proliferation of international contacts  international tension still exists in the Middle East and southern Africa  and  what seems to me to be worse still  other conflicts have arisen in Africa and other regions of the world.7.	A careful analysis of these tensions shows  on the one hand  how some of them have been with us for a long time and some are largely irrelevant to present-day problems; on the other hand  we see how far we have progressed towards solutions  so that I am led to ask why at this time  in many cases quite suddenly  tension rises up again in a given area of the world  in outbursts of violence and hatred. Who can be benefiting from all this? We should note that in any case it is rarely those who are tearing each other to pieces in battles and ambushes which  far from establishing anyone as victor  usually leave both sides the losers.8.	To all these direct threats to world peace we must add the short-comings of Governments in facing the problems of economic development  and the always numerous violations of human rights  I am forced to ask myself when the world will  finally  learn from its rather inglorious past.9.	Is it not discouraging to see still today-today perhaps more than ever—a quarter of a century after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  that these rights are daily violated in many countries? The evidence gathered during the  Prisoners of Conscience Year  of Amnesty International  the testimony of refugees and political exiles  the reports of our ambassadors and our journalists describe a situation where horror is often equalled only by the sufferings of men who have been physically and morally destroyed simply for having dared to think and—if I may be allowed the tautology—to think freely.10.	It is time for our Organization to deal seriously with this problem  not so much in terms of codifying rights as in terms of making sure that they are respected in practice. That is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other States; respect for human rights is not anyone's special preserve; it is part of the common and inalienable heritage of mankind. It must go far beyond ideologies and group solidarity  for what is at stake here is what is or should be the ultimate aim of all political action  that is to say  man himself and his dignity and freedom  and these  I repeat  are inalienable whether for men living in the East  in Uganda  in Viet Nam  in Chile or in our midst.11.	While the ideological struggle is going on or is even being intensified  when criticism against this or that Government or regime is becoming more and more insistent  when more or less justified accusations are levelled against anything that might even smack of imperialism  how can we not see that that is interference of quite a different kind from that represented by asking our Organization to take a larger and more active part in ensuring each man as many rights and freedoms as possible? For us  I repeat  human rights are not merely one means among others forachieving the aims of a particular policy. For us  the full and complete achievement of human rights and freedoms  the flourishing of these rights for all without restriction is an end in itself  perhaps the highest goal which a political leader can pursue. To that end  my country is prepared to support any realistic and constructive initiative aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations in this area.12.	I have spoken of disappointments  but also of hopes  and that holds true with regard to the question of the Middle East  among others. We find the state of no belligerency which now prevails in this region is far from satisfactory  and that is why I would make an urgent appeal to the parties concerned not only to resume the peace negotiations but also to accept the extended hand of the great friendly nation of the United States which  under the leadership of its President  is sparing to effort to bring a just and lasting peace to the Middle East to the benefit of all concerned. The solutions tirelessly advocated by President Carter and his Secretary of State  Mr. Vance  are honest and just  and deserve to be accepted. They are  moreover  for the most part in line with the relevant resolutions of our Organization. I would therefore call on all the parties concerned to resume the dialogue without any pre-conditions  and when I say  all the parties concerned  this naturally includes  as I said at this rostrum a number of years ago  the Palestinian people. Now that difficult negotiations are under way  I willingly exercise great caution and I shall therefore not air in public my detailed views on this subject; however  I should like to emphasize that it is just as illusory to wish to deny the existence  the right to a territory with guaranteed boundaries and the right to peaceful development to Israel as it is to deny them to the people of Palestine. On the other hand  territorial conquest on the pretext that it enhances the national security of a people will never make for durable peace  but only perpetuate war and bloody conflicts.13.	And now why waste time in establishing illusory exclusive conditions or to resolve sterile conflicts by resolutions and condemnations. We cannot wait here indefinitely for the last intransigents to overcome the last of their prejudices. It simply must be realized that the Assembly cannot just count the number of supporters on each side but we must find a solution which is acceptable first and foremost to all sides. That is the only way by which the small and medium-sized Powers which form the immense majority of the United Nations  can show that they are not simply pawns in a game  the rules and outcome of which they do not know. On the contrary they can make a real contribution to peace and security which are theirs as well as ours.14.	I now come to another sad chapter in the history of our Organization: I am speaking of the extremely complex problems of southern Africa.15.	Border incidents  bloody clashes and inhuman repressions  alas  continue to dominate the scene in this region. The hopes that we have pinned on a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe to try to make the minority regime accede to the wishes of the majority  have unfortunately not been achieved. Despite the mounting pressure of world  public opinion and in spite of growing opposition and internal armed struggle  the illegal minority Government ofIan Smith has succeeded in keeping the great majority of the population under the intolerable yoke of colonialism which disregards even the most elementary rights.16.	Rejecting negotiation which might have led to a peaceful transition to a majority regime  the Ian Smith regime is clutching at straws and its obstinacy and perseverance on the path of confrontation will not help at all. Only a negotiated solution can spare the country the greatest sacrifices and utter economic ruin.17.	I should like to pay a tribute to the efforts made by the United Kingdom and the United States in their search for a solution with the help of the United Nations and I appeal to all African countries and to the liberation movements in Zimbabwe to try to support this effort without any exclusive pre-conditions and in a manner which will allow the people concerned to express themselves freely.18.	In South Africa the policy of apartheid and that of the bantustans continue to take their toll of victims. There forms of inhuman racism have been of concern to our Organization for many years without any improvement in the fate of the oppressed peoples concerned being detected. This distressing situation persists in spite of repeated resolutions  lengthy conferences and many statements expressing understandable abhorrence at a regime which has cunningly and until now with impunity continued to humiliate and to exploit human beings pitilessly. If we want to see an end to this intolerable situation  words are not enough; actions are required from our Governments and real commitments are needed from -all our countries. Only at this cost and the cost of some sacrifices will we be able to succeed in making justice  equity and peace prevail in that part of the world.19.	The countries of the European Community have committed themselves to this policy and my colleague  Mr. Simonet  current President of the Community  has informed the Assembly of the initiatives our Community has taken and is still envisaging. The code of conduct adopted to control companies and enterprises in South Africa is a first step in trying to improve the lot of coloured workers. Other measures being studied now will highlight further our intention and our determination not simply to tolerate passively continuation of the present situation in South Africa.20.	In Lagos a few weeks ago we announced these initiatives and I should like to congratulate those who organized the World Conference for Action against Apartheid. Rarely  it seems to me has a meeting convened to discuss such explosive situations been able to do so with so much dignity.21.	While still on the subject of southern African problems  I should like to pay an unreserved tribute to the five countries which  through perseverance and persuasion contributed so greatly to speeding up the development of the situation in Namibia towards independence. This initiative deserves our full support because the sooner some  shall we say  formal hesitations are overcome  the sooner will the Namibians be able to proceed to self-determination. Here again last minute obstacles should not discourage us.22.	Unfortunately  southern Africa is not our only preoccupation in Africa. The border disputes which have proliferated between African countries have now assumed truly tragic proportions. I do not need to recall here my feelings for the people of this young continent or my personal commitment to their legitimate aspirations. I beg them to cease these fratricidal struggles  whether in Zaire  in West Africa or in the Horn of Africa-these border struggles which are as useless as they are interminable. They do not resolve the real problems. On the contrary  they merely provoke frustration and fan the spirit of revenge which breeds further murderous struggles. And who  may I ask  derives any benefit from all of this?23.	It took  as we all know  our ancient continent of Europe 10 centuries of bloodthirsty fighting and great sacrifices to recognize the pointlessness of all these struggles. We know how terrible these sacrifices were. It is perhaps their belated recognition of this that Ld our countries  hardly reassured as to their own borders  to consider abolishing them for the greater benefit of their citizens. We have things to learn from our neighbours as well  and what we can give them in experience and co-operation is more fruitful than simply wasting our energies in sterile quarrels.24.	The development  or perhaps we should say the stagnation  of the situation in Cyprus is naturally of great concern. While at the beginning of this year hopes were justified  thanks especially to the efforts made by our Organization  constructive talks between the two communities have not been held for several months.25.	It could be said  and some do say  that there are major reasons for this. Honestly I cannot go along with that because as soon as one looks for major reasons for not acting one finds them. In the meantime the situation deteriorates and solutions become more and more difficult. I personally continue to believe that the crisis in Cyprus and the future of that sovereign State  a fully fledged Member of our Organization  should be quickly resolved in Cyprus by the Cypriots of the two communities under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. Following the sudden demise of Archbishop Makarios it is up to his successors and to the leaders of the Turkish community in Cyprus to resume negotiations as soon as possible and to find a solution. No one will gain anything from acrimonious debates either in this forum or in any other expanded forum. Should we not help the new generation of Cypriots—since this is already the second generation—to bury hatred and the mistakes of their forefathers and to build up a land where the two communities can feel that they are Cypriots and are proud to be Cypriots? Our Organization should help in every way both in maintaining peace and in providing humanitarian aid.26.	I should like now to refer to a chapter whose importance and danger to humanity at large I cannot stress too strongly. I wish to speak of the frantic arms race which  far from abating  is gathering ever-increasing momentum.27.	Last year in this Assembly I criticized the disproportion between military budgets—some $300 billion— and the amount of money devoted to development for the 1 200 million people who live in a poverty no human being should have to endure.28.	What can we say of that today? Today  mention is made of $350 billion for military expenditure  whereas the number of those who suffer from famine  malnutrition and illiteracy increases from year to year. The developed countries spend 20 times more on military programmes than on development aid. But I must add that developing countries have also been caught up in the momentum of this dangerous frenzy  this fever  for their importation of increasingly sophisticated arms now exceeds a value of $6 billion.29.	Faced with these figures  which barely give an idea of the destructive potential that is being stockpiled and the terrible magnitude of the poverty which the majority of the world's population has suffered all too long  should we not say that the time has come at last to give up vain words for specific action? 30.	Next spring  a special session of the United Nations will be devoted to the burning question of disarmament. This is a very important step forward—I do not dare say  because I dare not believe  towards a definite solution of this question  but at least towards a possible lessening of the threat. We naturally welcome this initiative because it will enable us to define the problem and submit to the judgment of public opinion all its implications  among which its influence on the evolution and development of the whole of humanity is paramount.31.	It is with distress that we raise the question  which is without doubt justified  of whether our Organization-and above all the Members who bear the responsibility—will be able to take up the challenge which has been issued. Resolutions adopted at the special session cannot remain a dead letter; otherwise  the United Nations would run the risk of finding itself here more than elsewhere barred from the exercise of its main role as guarantor of peace.32.	Even before knowing the outcome of the special session devoted to disarmament  some have already launched an appeal for a world conference to deal with the same subject. I ask myself  is their trust in this first initiative  'which has not yet even begun  so very limited? Or perhaps they are not ready  as of 1978  to undertake the necessary commitments for the success of this urgent task? Without wishing  a priori  to dismiss such a conference  on condition that the nuclear Powers take part in it  I repeat  the postponement of a solution in my view would be tantamount almost to a refusal to halt the arms race and to a scarcely veiled avowal that the improvement of the condition of millions of people is not the first or the most immediate preoccupation of certain Governments.33.	Whether it is a special session of the United Nations or a world conference—its title has or will have nothing to do with its success-the success of the venture will depend not on the speeches but on the willingness to undertake firm commitments and to follow them up by specific action.34.	I have already drawn the attention of this thirty- second session of the General Assembly to the incommensurable gaps which exist between military expenditure and expenditure for the development of our brothers who live in almost complete destitution.35.	The poor  the undernourished  the badly housed and the ill educated are calling to us to free resources which are being used today for destruction  and to devote them to the noble cause of enabling those people to enjoy the riches of this world  so that the expression  human rights  in its widest sense will not remain without meaning for them.36.	What can we say of the world economic situation  the progress towards the so-called new international economic order which should in the final analysis enable all nations and all men to share more equitably in economic arrangements and structures?37.	The world economic situation presents a sombre picture. If inflation and unemployment have not increased again  nevertheless they remain disturbingly high and continue to represent an ominous threat to any progress or economic growth. All of us know today that the absence of economic growth will not further as we should wish the necessary  nay indispensable  effort with regard to development aid.38.	Certainly the results of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  called the North- South dialogue  fell short of the hopes and expectations of the developing countries. Although I would not deny this  in the least  I stress nevertheless that this was also the case in regard to the hopes of the so-called developed countries.39.	Despite these disappointments  which I think are practically inevitable  let us continue our dialogue; let us stress the tangible remits achieved; and let us seek tirelessly for compromise and for resolutions of the problems which remain unsolved  so as to reduce the discrepancy  dangerous to world peace  in the unequal distribution of riches between our countries. The seventh special session  the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi and the Paris Conference have shown us the way to go.40.	Let us renounce confrontation and passionate but sterile rhetoric and let us continue realistic discussion between reasonable people. What is at stake is worthy of patience  and the final results will depend on that  I know that the absence of results from the resumed thirty-first session does not inspire optimism  but is it not really too much to expect spectacular results of a very short session?I remain an optimist  for my part  because the failure  if failure there was  was in my view chiefly one of facile slogans   all or nothing  solutions which can never be found and will lead nowhere. It must be remembered that we are committed to a dialogue which should be permanent  which may at times produce euphoria  but which will certainly at others be slow  because in any great human enterprise there will always be crises. Just imagine: more than 150 sovereign States differing in history  culture  level of development and even interests  wish to join together to change the face of the world so as to ensure to everyone prosperity  peace and dignity. We shall not achieve that in 24 hours  or in a year. We shall never achieve it if we simply bludgeon ourselves with verbose resolutions. We shall perhaps succeed if we allow the vast enterprise of reflection  study and patient research undertaken by Governments in international forums and in this Organization itself time to mature  painfully to reconcile points of view  to raise support for realistic and realizable programmes and to mobilize all the energy possible to hasten the final advent of this new economic order to which we all aspire. In my opinion  that order cannot spring spontaneously from a world conference  but will be produced by a series of specialist conferences prepared and facilitated by negotiations between regional groups.41.	I have not been able to make any deliriously optimistic remarks. Nevertheless  it should not be thought that what I have said either on the persistent and grave threats to peace in the various regions of the world or the short-comings in the development of the economic situation constitutes a reproach addressed to the Organization. I have known for too long that his Organization has merely reflected both the good and the bad will of all its Members  and of their willingness to abide by its Charter  its conventions and its resolutions.42.	I wished simply to express at this rostrum the fears of a small nation which during the course of its history has run the gamut of all the scourges with which we have to deal  and which has resolutely placed all its hope and faith in agreement between the nations which call themselves united. We salute each success with enthusiasm  but I do not think we should waste any more time than that  for many problems and crises remain which require all our attention and effort.43.	For a long time still we shall have to live with failures and with successes  but I am convinced that through them we shall be able to make ever better use of the great possibilities offered by this Organization  which was born from a world which  shocked at the depths of human folly  wished to ensure a better future for humanity 44.	More than 30 years after that great humanitarian venture  once again we are asked to take up the challenge. Our Charter gives us the essential precepts and it is up to us to adapt ourselves to the new requirements of the evolution of our world.45.	It is an exalting task for each of us  that of contributing to world peace and to the material and intellectual well-being of all mankind. If we fail in this duty we shall deserve the worst of condemnation  that of our own children. 	"
"79",4334,"MAR",32,1977,"﻿41.	Mr. President  may I first of all express to you  on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on your election to preside over this thirty-second session of the General Assembly.42.	Choosing you as the person to undertake this heavy burden is the expression of the confidence and the esteem which you enjoy among us. I am sure that our Organization will find in your qualities and competence the best guarantee for a wise and enlightened guidance of our work  in seeking a significant reduction of the acute crises which loom over the horizon of the international community andan approach which is both determined and wise to each of the problems before us. Without doubt your election is also the expression of a recognition long due to your country because of its ceaseless contribution to strengthening the cause of peace and international co-operation and its dedication to the principles and ideals which guide our Organization and govern international relations.43.	I cannot fail to express the gratitude of my country to your eminent predecessor  the head of the delegation of Sri Lanka  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the Chairman of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries  for his exceptional efforts up to the end to ensure that our previous session closed with tangible results. I also wish to state to him our complete satisfaction with his diligence and the high sense of responsibility with which he presided and  we sincerely hope  will continue to preside over the yet uncertain destiny of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Indeed  a happy outcome of this important international conference  dedicated to the establishment of complete and total order in the law of the sea  will owe much to his outstanding guidance and invaluable personal contribution. His name will forever be linked to that great undertaking.44.	I should like at the same time to express my best wishes and welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and to the young Republic of Djibouti which  by acceding to membership in the United Nations  and by committing themselves to undertake the obligations and responsibilities deriving there from  will  I am sure  give full meaning to the universal calling of the United Nations.45.	There is no doubt that our Organization has  within the space of a generation  fully demonstrated its indispensable character as an instrument reflecting the lasting nature of human civilization  and as a bulwark for the highest values of that civilization against a massive return of destructive barbarism. It has to its credit far from negligible achievements in its vigilant safeguarding of international peace and security  even though the obstacles it has had to confront at times seemed insurmountable.46.	The appeal launched by our Secretary-General  to whom we must pay a well-deserved tribute for the lucidity and devotion he has shown at all times in serving the true objectives of the Charter  represents the aspirations of the international community towards the work of the Organization and the confidence that it will continue to place in its future. No Government conscious of its duties can remain indifferent at this time of major historical changes which are at the same time decisive  perilous and promising.47.	The General Assembly will have to deal with a number of important items on its agenda during this session. Many problems before it  of necessity  remain linked structurally. The number and magnitude of those problems should not lead us to despair of the virtues of patient dialogue and continuous action in harmony  where there is good faith and a real will to reach a viable and constructive solution.48.	The questions of the Middle East and of the rights of _ the Palestinian people  the situation in southern Africa andof disarmament  the international economic order and development  as well as the universal respect for humanrights-to cite only a few of the burning issues before us-are not the kind that may be continually deferred to other sessions without being given at least a partial solution at present.49.	Among the gravest political questions at the present time  the question of the Middle East remains one of the major concerns of my Government because of Israel's persistent aggression  stepped up as it is day after day  by its military occupation of the territories of Arab States  Members of the United Nations. It also remains a major concern of my Government because the Palestinian people  whose spoliation and intolerable humiliation are the essence of the problem  struggle continuously to recover their legitimate and inalienable rights  in particular  though the building of a sovereign and independent national entity.50.	My Government reaffirms its complete support for its fraternal Arab countries in their efforts to recover their occupied territories and to establish a genuine and lasting peace based on justice throughout the region of the Middle East and  in consequence and above all  on the basis of a solemn guarantee of the national rights of the Palestinian people.51.	The participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is the sole representative of the Palestinian people in every diplomatic effort to solve the crisis of the Middle East  remains the prerequisite without which these efforts cannot reach any decisive results. That is why my Government is particularly pleased about the recent development in relation to the attitude of the Government of the United States of America on the question  and in particular its statement on the need for the participation of Palestinian representatives in all negotiations for peace in the region.52.	Nevertheless  it is regrettable that Zionist leaders  by increasing their provocative initiatives  continue to develop a situation which represents a danger to world peace and security.53.	My Government strenuously objects to the Israeli measures intended to establish new settlements on occupied Arab territory in. a senseless attempt to modify their legal nature  their geographical characteristics  and their demographic composition.54.	The Israeli claims in considering Arab territories as ""liberated Israeli territories""-claims criticized by almost the whole international community—are a clear violation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter and of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. These claims are a threat to the careful negotiations which have been taking place for four years with a view to establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.55.	Furthermore  Israel's persistence in violating the principles of the United Nations is an outrage to our Organization and to the international community56.	In addition  my Government vigorously objects to the recent deployment of Israeli forces on parts of Lebanese territory. By invading southern Lebanon  Israel is extending yet another tentacle over a fourth Arab country-and thus allows no respite for healing the wounds of war-whose prolonged tragedy bears witness in the most painful manner to the vast criminal plan being pursued methodically and mercilessly in that region by the Zionist State.57.	Israel's obstinacy in pursuing its expansionist and egocentric policies is a short-sighted view  and its perpetually negative reaction to every initiative to obtain genuine peace on the basis of justice and right inevitably exposes the region to a return of tension and of the turmoil which can only soon threaten world peace and security. It is now more necessary than ever for the international community to review its position on this open rebellion against society's laws and fundamental principles  and even against the most elementary rules which should govern a civilized international society.58.	It is up to the General Assembly once again to reaffirm that a just and lasting peace can only be established by a total withdrawal from all of the territories occupied since 5 June 1967  the return of Jerusalem to its legitimate status  and recovery by the Palestinian people of their full rights  particularly by its right to build up a sovereign and independent nation-State.59.	Jerusalem is and will remain for the Arab and Moslem world one of the centres of its spiritual existence. Its liberation constitutes one of the decisive elements for a just peace and one of the vital conditions for a lasting peace.60.	It is also up to the General Assembly to declare that all measures taken by Israel in the occupied territories to establish settlements there and to apply its laws to the Arab populations in these territories are null and void and can have no legal effect.61.	I could not conclude this vital question without greeting with satisfaction the Joint Soviet-American statement of 1 October 1977  which constitutes a positive step towards a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.62.	What I have said about the policy pursued by Israel in the Middle East may be applied  in the very same terms  to the policy of the ""rearguard struggle"" of the real ""bunkers"" of the colonial era in Africa  namely the racist minority regimes of southern Africa63.	The parallel between the two policies may in the past have seemed bold to some and  for reasons which are more sentimental than objective  may have led to violent and indignant protests. Even if the situation in southern Africa has unfortunately during the past year had to share the spotlight with the situation in the Middle East in their daily efforts to command the attention of world public opinion  it has nevertheless brought into one open the alliance between the rebel regimes of southern Africa and Israel. This de facto alliance  which has become increasingly organized and deliberate  is taking on the aspects of a plot  with incalculable consequences for Arab and African peoples and international peace and security.64.	My Government reaffirms its full and unconditional support for Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania in their struggle—which is that of all Africa—to recover their dignity and their legitimate rights to free determination and national territorial integrity.65.	My Government also supports the front-line countries  in particular the Republic of Zambia  which is subjected relentlessly to most savage terrorist raids by the Salisbury Government.66.	As regards Namibia  the scandalous last-minute attempt by the Government of Pretoria to detach the port of Walvis Bay from Namibian territory cannot but give rise to additional concern as to the possibility of a forthcoming settlement that will safeguard the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia  to which our Organization remains legally and morally bound. This attempt cannot but remind us of the no less scandalous Zionist attempt in occupied Arab territories  both dictated by the same illusion of gaining time or keeping all options open by hampering the achievement of a peaceful solution in accordance with international law within the time-limit set by the United Nations.67.	The World Conference for Action against Apartheid  which met in the month of August this year at Lagos  was a vital step in making the international community aware of the need to accelerate  by every possible means  the promotion of the cause of human freedom and equality in southern Africa.68.	It is indispensable to isolate the racist minority regimes and to ensure the full and effective application of United Nations decisions and resolutions with respect to the economic boycott of those regimes and the strictest embargo on the sale of arms to them.69.	We firmly hope that the appeal made in the final declaration of the Conference will be universally heeded so as to eliminate as soon as possible the imminent risk of a generalized explosion  with unforeseeable consequences  in that part of the world.70.	If our African continent appears to be dramatically within the ""storm zone""  that is due in part to the permanent violence in which it is placed  despite the Charter  by the illegal and anachronistic regimes of racist oppression  and in part to the geo-political time bombs that the colonial era and the era of recalcitrant decolonization which succeeded it in the past 20 years have thoughtlessly planted among its peoples to perpetuate division and create or exacerbate among them  down the years and at the cost of fratricidal struggles  an unnatural antagonism71.	The Kingdom of Morocco is convinced that African unity remains one of the most positive achievements of the international community. It is thanks to its strengthening that the continent has been spared from becoming once again  as in the previous century  a mere pawn in international relations  a haven for the exercise of big Power rivalries destined to be ?. mottled chequer-board of so-called zones of influence.72.	In truth  there is nothing more absurd than the introduction of the notion of so-called ""ideological frontiers"" in an effort to justify an abnormal cleavage among countries with identical or similar socio-economic problems  countries which  in spite of any self-pro claimed ideological label  share in each of the subregions of the continent a common heritage  particularly when they must  each in accordance with the national course it has chosen for itself and in keeping with its resources  meet the same imperative requirements of rapid and harmonious development and the general social and cultural advancement of their peoples.73.	Nor is anything more perilous for the continental organization and for its capacity for unity  given the real threats to which it remains exposed because of distracting interventions from outside Africa and the deliberate perversion of juridical and ethical concepts and values which have always served and still serve to support the legitimate struggles for national liberation  in order to provide a pretext -odious in more ways than one-for more or less open subversion and aggression against neighbours.74.	That is why Morocco  in accordance with the Charter of our continental organization  maintains more than ever solidarity with all other African countries in the actions undertaken jointly to liberate that part of the world from any form of foreign domination and to resist any illicit recourse to force.75.	This policy has already been demonstrated by the first meeting l."" the Heads of the African States  which took place in Casablanca from 3 to 7 January 1961 and which  for the first time in contemporary history  laid down for the continent the bases for African unity  co-operation and solidarity  which were three years later endorsed by the Charter of Addis Ababa.76.	It was in this same spirit that the first conference of liberation movements in the former Portuguese colonies was held also in Casablanca in April 1961.77.	It is because Morocco is faithful to those same principles that we have twice accepted the shedding of the blood of our sons on the field of honour in Zaire-first in 1960  after the appeal made by the United Nations  and again some months later following the appeal made by Zaire through the Organization of African Unity78.	Once the objective had beep obtained  the Moroccan troops were each time repatriated in order  discipline and honour  their action having served first and foremost to circumscribe a serious and thorny problem within an inter-African context  thus avoiding the danger of an extension of a conflict which threatened international peace and security.79.	The ninth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Rabat in June 1972  was undoubtedly one of the most notable milestones in the history of the OAU. ""The spirit of Rabat"" which emerged on that occasion and which represents a means—frank  realistic and cordial  but free of passion-of tackling questions of importance  continues to inspire the policy of my Government in respect to inter-African relations. We cannot doubt that that spirit will continue to prevail in the higher interests of our peoples in the bodies responsible for taking decisions in the plenary conferences of the Heads ofState seeking truly African solutions for the most difficult problems of our continent.80.	Morocco  consistent with the duties of brotherhood imposed upon it by the two halves of its identity  which is at once Arab and African  has always sought  whether within the framework of the League of Arab States or that of the OAU  to promote the peaceful and prompt solution of any disputes of any kind which might arise in the Arab world or on the African continent.81.	It is in this spirit that my Government has seized the two regional organizations of the situation of artificial tension which has been created in the Maghreb subregion since the outcome-11 years after the item was included by Morocco in the agenda of the United Nations—of the process of the decolonization of the Moroccan and Mauritanian Atlantic Saharan provinces formerly under Spanish domination.82.	It is also in this spirit that Morocco supported resolution 81 (XIII) of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government which met at Port Louis  Mauritius  in July 1976. This resolution advocates the convening of a special African summit meeting to study the ins and outs of what has come to be called the ""question of Western Sahara""  although the harshest light has been thrown  day after day  on the true nature of that question by the very evolution of events. This in itself enables anyone whose judgement is not obscured by artisan passions readily to see through the subterfuge in which this question has been only too abundantly enmeshed and to see more clearly what is really at stake  in good conscience and with goodwill.83.	Thus  confident that a meeting at this level of responsibility could not be intended further to envenom the situation  already very regrettable and explosive  with regard to present relations among three neighbouring brother countries and  in general  inter-African relations  Morocco was the first to support the proposal of the current Chairman of the OAU  Mr. Omar Bongo  the President of the Republic of Gabon  to convene the special summit that it was planned to hold in Lusaka  the capital of Zambia  during the first two weeks of October. We know  however  that at the beginning of the month of September the Government of Zambia made known to all States members of the OAU that it was no longer in a position to act as host to that summit meeting because of the grave circumstances confronting its country and because only two countries had agreed officially to take part.84.	After having placed great hopes in the results that such a pan-African conference  meeting in the required conditions  could have in improving inter-Maghreb relations  Morocco can only profoundly deplore the circumstances which have compelled the Republic of Zambia to rescind its generous invitation. My Government wishes to take this opportunity to repeat to the Government of President Kenneth Kaunda its total solidarity in the trials to which his country is subjected by the racist oppressors of the people of Zimbabwe and its sincere admiration in connexion with the heavy price which the front-line geographical position of that brotherly country obliges it to pay so courageously in the sacred cause of the freedom and dignity of the African people.85.	The consistently misguided temptations of a certain policy have alone been at the root of the problem of interstate relations existing in our Maghreb sub region and facing the regional organizations to which we belong. They have also  unfortunately and very directly  been at the root of a humanitarian problem of particular gravity  that of the Moroccan and Mauritanian citizens who are at present held against their will in the region of Tindouf. Because of the means and methods by which it was created from whole cloth in the very last phase of a process of decolonization that was difficult and often tedious but juridical and politically inevitable  this problem serves to mask an adverse design  at first modestly unannounced  and then—at the most critical moment when the unanimous solidarity of African brothers should not have been denied us-more and more openly revealed by its actions  which are more eloquent and more revealing than soothing official statements or solemn engagements entered into in conferences of heads of State or the carefully weighed and duly ratified clauses of a treaty of brotherhood and good neighbourliness.86.	The thousands of original inhabitants of the Moroccan and Mauritanian provinces of the Sahara who have returned  having been dispossessed of their homes because of the vicissitudes of decolonization  are innocent hostages of an ill-judged policy that is doomed  through its successive twists and turns  to reach an impasse.87.	The ranks of these displaced persons have been greatly swollen  either by the Touraregs of the central Sahara or by genuine refugees who have fled from the Sahel because of the exceptional drought of the last three years. They have also been led by mercenaries  most of whom had belonged to the Spanish colonial forces and who did not hesitate to offer their services to the highest bidder in the confused situation resulting from decolonization.88.	My Government has absolute proof that the vast majority of persons displaced from the Atlantic provinces of the Sahara and settled in camps in the region of Tindouf have been held against their will. In spite of intensive indoctrination  entire families and armed elements have continued their efforts to regain their homes  at the risk of their halves  ever since the appeal launched by the Heads of State of Morocco and Mauritania  His Majesty King Hassan II and President Moktar Ould Daddah.89.	It is flagrantly obvious that the Atlantic Moroccan and Mauritanian Saharan provinces are peaceful and perfectly integrated in the national life. The vast majority of their populations  according to the last census taken by the former Administering Authority  have remained in their homes and therefore participated normally this year  with a high electoral turn-out  in communal  provincial  professional and legislative elections.90.	It is high time  therefore  to put an end to the isolation and sufferings of these displaced persons. In futureonly their interest  health and well-being  and their resettlement among their own people  should determine any action taken on their behalf.91.	It is in this spirit that the Executive Committee of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees adopted at Geneva on 12 October 1976 a decision in which it:""Took note of the statements made by the observers for Mauritania and Morocco  who drew special attention to the fact that measures were called for with a view to voluntary repatriation  in accordance with the appeal made by the Heads of State of Mauritania and Morocco  and who declared that the persons in question had been brought in and detained against their will;""and requested the High Commissioner:""... to continue his programme of humanitarian assistance and at the same time to undertake discussions with the Governments with a view to the speedy implementation  in accordance with the usual policy of his Office  of permanent solutions  including voluntary repatriation and durable settlement"".92.	My Government took note with satisfaction of the decision of the Secretary-General to organize without delay a census of the displaced persons from the former Spanish Sahara. On 2 September we also informed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that we were fully prepared to co-operate with his Office so that the census could be held on a completely honest and impartial basis and without any delay that might prejudice its humanitarian objective.93.	It is regrettable to note that to date the Algerian Government has not replied to the request for information addressed to it by the High Commissioner for Refugees despite the urgent nature of those requests.94.	Furthermore  my Government wishes to emphasize that the assistance given by humanitarian organizations has done nothing to lessen the sufferings and hardships of the persons concerned. On the contrary  this aid has acted as an encouragement and impetus to a war-like undertaking  systematically sheltering behind displaced-persons camps in violation of multilateral humanitarian conventions and protocols  including the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa  signed at Addis Ababa on 10 September 1969. Of this war-like undertaking  the true objectives of which will be a secret to no one  the attacks at Nouakchott and Zouerate are flagrant examples  if any were needed.95.	Nevertheless  the Treaty of Mutual Defence  which has united Mauritania and Morocco since 13 May of this year  confirms the determination of the two countries jointly and in solidarity to protect their national sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence  in accordance with article II of the Charter of the OAU.96.	Morocco solemnly reaffirms its determination to stand by its Mauritanian brothers and to spare no effort to assist them in safeguarding their refund unity and reconstituted territorial integrity.97.	Any attack directed against either of the two countries would  in the eyes of the other  automatically constitute an attack against its own unity and be a violation of its own territory.98.	If I have taken the liberty to dwell at such length on the abnormal situation created in our Maghreb sub region during the last two years  it is in order to make it understood that this situation has reached a crucial point where there is a choice between  on the one hand  the obstinate pursuit of a policy of ""reasons of State"" totally lacking in any normal reasoning  and which  moreover  if continued would constitute an insult to our common past and the recent struggles of the people of Maghreb  and on the other hand  once the page of errors and offences has been turned  a new start in the building  on a basis of mutual respect  of a common future which will for us represent  both rationally and emotionally  something that is historically inevitable.99.	One cannot speak  furthermore  about the ""Maghreb of the peoples"" and persist in ignoring a genuine national liberation cause-the will of a people so clearly expressed as that of the peoples of Morocco and Mauritania  who will spare no sacrifice to defend their respective dearly-bought unities.100.	To quote His Majesty King Hassan II  who said this quite recently:""One cannot live as neighbours by turning our backs on each other. Every politician who considers such a possibility would be of a reprehensible frivolity ...""In blocks of apartments there is a manager who settles problems among the tenants; in the Maghreb the manager is the unwavering will of its population...""Even if we did not desire this aim  the population would desire it because it is the dream of the preceding generation. And it is our dream. Furthermore  it is our well-being. It is vain for each of us to seek our own resources  our own opportunities  in development or elsewhere for we cannot hope  at a time when the world is uniting economically in regional groups in order to survive  to live in isolation  in separate islands. The will of our peoples is the true manager of the building to which I referred.""101.	My Government is concerned to avoid anything that may be irreparable  and wishes to lay solid bases of good understanding and co-operation in our sub region of the Maghreb; we accordingly rejoice at the opportunity offered by the States members of the Conference on European Security and Co-operation to participate with other Mediterranean Arab countries in the work of the forthcoming session of that Conference at ministerial level which is to be held in Belgrade.102.	It will be recalled that in 1973 that Conference had asked its First Committee  in article (15) of its final recommendations that:""In considering questions relating to security in Europe  the Committee will bear in mind the broader context of world security and in particular the relationship which exists between security in Europe and in the Mediterranean area.'""103.	Morocco  geographically the closest to Europe  is impelled to bear witness to its constant interest and its encouragement of the historic enterprise that Europe is undertaking to eliminate the vestiges of the past and to replace confrontation and challenge by dialogue  so as to consolidate  in an irreversible fashion  peace and cooperation in that part of the world.104.	However  in the light of past and present events  those efforts seem to be limited in their objective and scope. We are convinced that  to become more active arid effective  detente cannot be limited only to the European continent but should  on the contrary  be extended to all peoples living on the shores of the Mediterranean.105.	More than ever  the Mediterranean represents one of the axes on which the destiny of Europe turns. It is still a crucial area particularly sensitive to any factors which affect the destiny of Europe  which in turn is immediately sensitive to any deterioration in the conflicts in the Mediterranean.106.	Any attempt to separate the security of the two shores of the Mediterranean would seriously jeopardize that security; to leave it incomplete would be to leave it fragile and more apparent than real.107.	We hope that in the months and years to come a Mediterranean conscience will develop at the political level  in order to realize the region's vocation to be  as it has been called  a ""lake of peace"" and a unique centre of coexistence  or  even better  of convergence  among civilizations and cultures  in the same way as coexistence spontaneously developed at the technical level  so that the Mediterranean can preserve its marine environment and marine resourcesfrom irreversible deterioration. *108.	We consider that the restoration of harmony in the sub region of the Aegean Sea  including the reconciliation between the two Cypriot communities that is being actively pursued under the auspices ""of the United Nations  to be one of the most decisive tests of the maturity of this ""Mediterranean conscience"".109.	The international community now views the problems of disarmament as being the most agonizing problems of our time. It is entitled to expect the utmost from the special session to be held on this item next year. While final solutions may be too much to expect  there must at least be an urgent plan to stop the feverish arms race which is now taking the form of a headlong dash to the edge of the precipice.110.	The human race should take no pride in the fact that armaments is its most flourishing industry. Our community can hardly be expected to achieve its aims on the basis of ideals and principles of the Charter so long as the relations which govern our contemporary world continue to be determined mainly by military and strategic considerations.111.	As our Secretary-General said in his report: ""The task ahead is immensely difficult and complex ..."" With him we hope that in the years to come the United Nations: .. will be able to show its collective determination to fulfil them112.	The close link between a solution to development problems and a global disarmament policy has been perceived with a reasonable degree of certainty. The special session next year will have to consider these priority questions on its agenda.113.	Since the sixth special session  the plan for a new international economic order has proceeded from the stage of an idea to that of a sufficiently specific concept  both in its regional and sectoral aspects  without  however  yet becoming operational.114.	For this we must pay a tribute to the President of the Republic of France  Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing  for having taken the initiative to convene in Paris the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in order to try to give real content to some of the generous but rather vague and indefinite goals of the plan of action.115.	Thus  despite the scepticism manifested at the closure of debate  we consider that the Conference has produced results which industrialized and developing countries should consider to be positive. The Conference never claimed to lay down an operative scheme that would lead to the immediate establishment of a new international economic  order not to overcome the differences between groups of countries on such delicate subjects as energy or the indebtedness of developing countries.116.	We consider that the Conference is a gain for the international community. We shall do everything we can in the international agencies to bring about a project  the technical content of which has been defined but whose realization remains subject to the political will of the industrialized countries.117.	Now that the North-South dialogue is under the auspices of the United Nations  it must continue of necessity on the basis of broader concepts of North and South both here in the General Assembly and in UNCTAD.118.	We consider that all forms of agreement  Euro-Arab and Afro-Arab dialogues in particular  are sectors of rapprochement and solidarity  not only between wealthy and poor countries but also among the developing countries themselves.119.	As regards the Euro-Arab dialogue  I must add that from the Arab point of view this dialogue must be wide-ranging and not restricted to the economic and political areas. One must enlarge the viewpoint that usually prevails in the drafting of political charters  trade agreements or cultural conventions and to engage in this dialogue looking to the future  as the stake in this enterprise demands.120.	If the aspirations to a new economic order have not been totally dashed during the past year  it is due largely to the Arab-African conference on co-operation  held in Cairo  which has demonstrated the sincere desire of the Arab countries to work for a harmonization of development efforts in the Arab world and on the African continent.121.	Only with the passage of time will we be able to assess the importance of this first Arab-African conference for the maintenance on a solid basis of an equitable balance between countries with financial surpluses and those which have not.122.	It is however to be deplored that the most advanced countries have been so inert in bilateral or multilateral negotiations and seem more prepared to act on the basis of expediency rather than to change their structures.123.	The protectionist reactions of the advanced countries in respect of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from the developing countries reveal reflex actions rather than reflection. They are the clearest and most irrational manifestation of what an enlightened economist called the ""great fear of development""  which sacrifices to short-term interests the common prosperity to be gained over the medium term. Because trade remains the major law of industrial development and  conversely  industrial development  as it progresses  leads to trading conditions favourable to the parties concerned  small wonder that the bulk of international trade takes place among the industrialized countries.124.	We are pleased that our partners in the European Economic Community have finally had the foresight to reconsider the most restrictive measures taken this year. The world trend nevertheless remains disturbing. Unless it is reversed in the spirit of GATT and unless public opinion and the legal bodies of the most advanced countries are not told  as they should be  of the nefarious consequences of such a choice  we very much fear that all opportunities to correct the most flagrant anomaly in international economic relations  that is the continued deterioration in the terms of trade  will be lost.125.	The upheavals in the world economy in past years have affected the structure of the international monetary system to such an extent that one can speak of dislocation. Despite this structural turmoil  there have been important changes in a positive direction in the activities of IMF.126.	We consider that it is encouraging to have an agreement on the principles and procedures applicable to a firm supervision of the exchange systems and practices of member countries. We hope that IMF  in applying these procedures  will take into account the circumstances of the developing countries.127.	As regards the use of IMF resources  we again urge that the conditions for drawing upon IMF should be applied with flexibility so that as many of our countries as possible may benefit from financial assistance. Because of this we attach the utmost importance to the seventh general review of quotas  which would enable the Fund not only to acquire additional resources but also to authorize member countries  particularly the poorer ones  to receive increased aid.128.	I cannot better conclude than by reaffirming the unflagging faith of my country in the sacred principles upon which our institutions are based and our determination to work together with those who believe in the future of the United Nations so that peace  understanding and solidarity will for ever prevail in international relations.129.	It is in this context that we are in favour of prior agreement  objective dialogue and a positive attitude which will of necessity lead to positive solutions  if everyone submits to a strict observance of the rules which we have ourselves decided on  and the principles which add to the wealth of our supreme law.130.	The Kingdom of Morocco  aware of its responsibilities  true to its commitments and vigilant about the respect of its rights  will spare no effort to see that  beyond passion  pondered logic  fruitful moderation and active solidarity prevail in seeking the best solutions.131.	At a time when  in many parts of the world  armaments seem to have become the only form of debate  it has become more than ever essential solemnly to invite nations to a more humane conception of international life and to a more rigorous respect for the sacred values of our civilization.132.	I venture to hope that the present session of our Organization will  with all necessary vigour  remind one and all of the vital need for respect for the rule of law.133.	I believe that our common  sincere and determined efforts will once again prod the consciences of those who bear responsibility throughout the world regarding the moral obligations which they have freely entered into. "
"80",4429,"MDG",32,1977,"﻿226.	Mr. President  the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar is particularly gratified at your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your great experience in international affairs as well as the committed and decisive role that Yugoslavia has always played within the non-aligned movement and in concert with the developing countries qualifies you more than any other to preside over our deliberations.227.	Our thanks and congratulations go to Mr. Hamilton Amerasinghe  the Ambassador of Sri Lanka  who directed with tact and authority the proceedings of the previous session  respecting the principles of the Charter and always serving the international community.228.	My delegation would also like to stress the dedication with which the Secretary-General has endeavoured  in all circumstances  to make the collective will of Member States prevail  pursuant to the mandate that we have entrusted to him.229.	The Democratic Republic of Madagascar welcomes with joy the admission to our Organization of the Republic of Djibouti and of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.230.	The determination of the liberation movements of Djibouti and the political leaders of that country have made it possible for that country to overcome the difficulties inherent in its colonial situation and to make the will for unity and emancipation of its people prevail.231.	The presence among us of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a source of particular satisfaction for the delegation of Madagascar because it marks the culmination of the long and difficult struggle of a people firmly attached to its freedom  its sovereignty  its independence and to the promotion of social progress.232.	The admission of these two States to the Organization bears witness to the predominant role that the countries of the third world intend to  ought to  play in international affairs without there being any need to refer to a certain polarization that has pre-determined the direction of decisions and actions of the United Nations since its foundation. This change  which we welcome but some still question  requires in our opinion a reordering of priorities and a new attitude in the perception of the over-all interests of the community of nations.233.	Developments in the international situation between the two sessions of the General Assembly have not been such as to allay anxieties.234.	Despite our collective efforts  the United Nations has not been able to make a positive contribution to the solution of many problems the persistence of which justify our pessimism about the effectiveness of our procedures for negotiation and the sincerity and will of one and all to make the necessary compromises.235.	The conflicts of convictions  of ideas and of action continue to sustain flash-points of tension  particularly in Africa. New forms of intervention have been devised to undermine the security of certain States  the political options of which cannot and could never coincide with those of the imperialist  capitalist and neo-colonial interests.236.	However  in the past 10 years  we have witnessed the emergence of conditions which in our opinion can ensure the triumph of world revolution.237.	The universal acceptance of peaceful coexistence  the growing challenge of the concept of power  the decrease in the manifestations of the cold war and of polarization are factors which have contributed to the improvement of international relations. The third world has fully asserted itself by proposing a rational and concerted policy which takes account of the irreversible downfall of colonialism and of the primary role of the United Nations in establishing a new international order.238.	These encouraging prospects have produced negative reactions on the part of the imperialist capitalists  who cling blindly to the acquisitions and privileges of the past and are thus bent on preserving the status quo.239.	We are forced to recognize that there is a situation of confrontation which some seek to conceal or to force into oblivion by preaching the virtues of selective interdependence  of dialogue  of gradual action and prolonged negotiation  all of which constitute excessive delaying tactics.240.	It may be too early  of course  to speak of a real crisis  but we have the firm conviction that the preliminary signs are there.241.	Indeed  the world is today witnessing attempts at colonial reconquest and the resurgence of neo-colonialism. The principles of the Charter  such as self-determination  have been distorted in a shameful and cynical way.242.	In order to safeguard their economic  political and military interests some are not inhibited either by the resumption of the ""peculiar dialogue"" with the racist regimes of southern Africa or elsewhere or by the destabilization of the progressive revolutionary regimes committed to the true struggle for freedom of the peoples. Interference in the internal affairs of States has become a common practice in the name of moralizing principles and attempts are made to impose on others norms that are contrary to the safeguarding of their own security.243.	That understanding which is the main objective of international relations is still a distant goal. Positions are being marked out to such a degree that we are seeing a real regression  concealed by bits and pieces of measures and gestures of so-called ""goodwill"".244.	The countries of the third world  particularly the non-aligned countries  have no choice other than to take up the challenge hurled at them by international reaction. We for our part are not bent on confrontation but it is our duty to preserve  defend and promote the achievements of the past decade. It is from this standpoint that we will analyse the world political  economic and social situation and it is on this basis that we will determine our positions and our action  and decide on the measures to be taken within the United Nations.245.	Africa cannot be said to have neglected its economic and social development because two important meetings have been held there: the eleventh extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU  held from 6 to 10 December 1976 in Kinshasa and devoted to economic affairs; and the historic Cairo Conference of March 1977  which established the framework of Arab-African cooperation.246.	But obviously the major problems facing the African leaders are political in nature and concern independence  security and the total liberation of the continent.247.	Indeed  international imperialism has not renounced the desire to keep the African continent under its domination: interventions against progressive countries have increased as is evidenced by the aggression against the People's Republic of Benin  the attempts at destabilization in Angola and the political assassination of the late President Marien Ngouabi. The Shaba affair and other local conflicts have unfortunately provided the reactionary forces of the West with an opportunity to establish a new form of interference in the African political scene. This means that vigilance is called for because rivalries that are no longer fashionable in a world of detente are developing in Africa and endangering the realization of the full emancipation of the African continent.248.	In southern Africa the action of the United Nations has not led to the results expected  because of the refusal of certain Powers to recognize the urgency and the gravity of a situation which threatens international peace and security. The crisis in this region would have been resolved long ago if certain Western Powers had not collaborated with the forces of racism and colonialism and had not afforded them their protection and their sanction. We are convinced of the need to deal with the problems of apartheid  Rhodesia and of Namibia in terms of their profound unity. But it is absolutely necessary to recognize that priority must be given to the situation in South Africa even though there might be some merit in attacking first those points where the forces of racism and colonialism offer the least resistance.249.	In South Africa the objective remains the restoration of human dignity. The true nature of the problem is not restricted to the restoration of human rights; it is not only a question of granting civil and political rights to the majority. Quite the contrary. We are faced with a situation that has to be remade  remodelled on democratic lines. In other words  it is a situation which will not be resolved without a true popular revolutionary process.250.	The elimination of apartheid  the cessation of massacres and repression are only phases  the recognition of political rights can only be the beginning of a new period of transformation at all levels. Government by the majority will be meaningless unless it is accompanied by an economic and social revolution permitting  inter alia  the recuperation of national wealth that has been seized and monopolized hitherto by capitalist  imperialist and neo- colonialist circles. The struggle should aim at the establishment of an economic system which would benefit the majority and at the elimination of all interests that are incompatible with this approach. We feel that any solution proposed must be examined in terms of these objectives.251.	We reject any initiative the ulterior motive of which is to perpetuate a certain neo-colonial structure which  on the pretext of maintaining the current prosperity of the South African economy  would in fact seek to perpetuate injustice and the exploitation of the Africans.252.	In view of the incapacity of certain Western countries to choose between their own immediate interests and the just cause of the majority  and in view of the intransigence of the Pretoria authorities and the heinous repressions visited daily upon the innocent people of South Africa  we firmly support the liberation movements which have chosen to combat apartheid by armed struggle.253.	The preceding remarks also hold true for Zimbabwe and Namibia  whose future depends upon developments in South Africa.254.	In Zimbabwe  where the Ian Smith regime is daily being driven further towards certain defeat by the blows inflicted upon it by the armed forces of the Patriotic Front  the colonizing Power  which since 1965 has not adopted any effective measure to bring down the rebels  has recently been endeavouring to find an honourable way out of the hopeless situation to the creation of which it has contributed.255.	The United Kingdom has just requested the Security Council to come to its aid and have the Secretary-General name a special representative.256.	My delegation cannot oppose a certain United Nations presence in Zimbabwe  if that will facilitate the complete  sincere and genuine decolonization of the Territory.257.	The appointment of that representative as well as his role  his attributes and his powers must be defined in close consultation between the members of the Security Council and the Patriotic Front.258.	The Democratic Republic of Madagascar reaffirms its militant and committed support of the Patriotic Front  the genuine representative of the people of Zimbabwe  and reserves its position with regard to the links which some would wish to establish between the appointment of the special representative of the Secretary-General and the acceptance of the so-called Anglo-American plan for a settlement.259.	We continue to denounce South Africa's refusal to co-operate with the United Nations in order to find a solution to the problem of Namibia. We cannot accept or endorse the South African idea whose aim is the dismemberment of this international Territory and its transformation into a confederation of small tribal states  controlled and manipulated by the racist regime and its allies so as to make it a buffer between themselves and independent Africa. We cannot entertain the idea of negotiations before South Africa has accepted the conditions laid down by SWAPO and endorsed by OAU  namely  the withdrawal of all South African military and paramilitary forces from Namibia and the guaranteeing of the establishment of a normal political climate; the unconditional liberation of all political prisoners and the return to Namibia of all Namibians in exile; the endorsement by the United Nations Council for Namibia of the appointment in the Territory of any interim authority prior to independence; and the accession of the Territory to independence within its present limits  including Walvis Bay.260.	The situation in other regions of Africa continues to be of equal concern to us.261.	The painful vicissitudes of the struggle of the Saharan people point to the emptiness of the claims of those who want to close the file on Western Sahara. Although sanctioned by the former administering Power  the solution of the dismemberment and annexation of that country has never been accepted by the United Nations  and still less by OAU.262.	The Democratic Republic of Madagascar supports the right of the Saharan people to a free and independent destiny and  in recognizing the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  it has demonstrated its willingness not to accept the fait accompli created by the Governments of Morocco and Mauritania.263.	In the Horn of Africa  we deem it essential that the two brother countries  Ethiopia and Somalia  be and remain truly independent  revolutionary and socialist. But that is Where the shoe pinches  for imperialism is trying to prolong €he conflict in order to make us forget the Zionist colonial grip on Palestine and the grip of imperialism  racism and apartheid on southern Africa.264.	That is why we believe that it is the duty of all progressive countries of the world  and in particular those of Africa  to work for a reconciliation between those two sister revolutions so as not to play the game of international imperialism in that strategic region of Africa.265.	The President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  Mr. Didier Ratsiraka  is not unaware of the difficulties of mediation in this conflict. However  he believes that it is no longer possible to remain silent. It would be dishonourable for Africa not to try to find a solution to this specifically African problem or to allow non-African Powers to resolve it in their own way and even to their benefit. For our part we shall continue our efforts  even if we have to begin again a thousand times  for any conflict  whatever it may be  always ends in negotiations.266.	With regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte  my delegation cannot subscribe to the arguments put forward by France to legalize an occupation which has been repeatedly denounced by OAU and the entire international community.267.	Threats to international peace and security in southern Africa; the acute crisis in the Horn of Africa; the maintenance of the French colonial presence in the Comorian island of Mayotte—how could we remain indifferent and not share our anxiety about these issues?268.	In these circumstances  the Assembly will appreciate 'hat my delegation cannot emphasize too much the need to implement the objectives of the solemn Declaration by which the General Assembly on 16 December 1971 designated the Indian Ocean as a none of peace.269.	Again last year the General Assembly reaffirmed its conviction that the implementation of the Declaration would be a substantial contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security. No real progress has however been made because the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean is faced with a lack of co-operation on the part of certain great Powers and certain maritime users. Of course  we have taken note of the public statements of the two super-Powers which led to a so-called preliminary meeting. No valid result concerning the Indian Ocean can be obtained without the participation of the coastal States  for exclusivist on the part of the superpowers can only engender mistrust and lack of understanding.270.	Furthermore  the coastal States believe that the maintenance of peace and security in their region in the final analysis fall within their authority and their competence  without being subject to the interests of Powers foreign to the region. Any bilateral or multilateral negotiations on the maintenance of peace in the Indian Ocean cannot be crowned with success if they aim only at a compromise between the interests of those Powers; what is important is to ensure real guarantees of independence and security for the countries of the region.271.	Like other coastal States  the Democratic Republic of Madagascar refuses to admit that the notion of a zone of peace can be distorted to justify any military presence or activities incompatible with the Declaration on the Indian Ocean. Indeed  history has taught us how the notion of the freedom of the seas has been invoked by the imperialist Powers of Europe to ensure maritime supremacy. Any idea of supremacy in the Indian Ocean  whether exercised by a single super-Power  or by two or several Powers with opposing interests that counterbalance one another  must be rejected; it is in this conviction that we reaffirm the validity of all the objectives of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean.272.	Elsewhere  both in Africa and in the Indian Ocean region  other hotbeds of tension are of particular concern to my Government. In the Middle East  any delay in the solution of the Palestinian question and in that of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories increases the dangers of war. The responsibility of Israel for the prolongation of this explosive situation leaves no room for doubt. The proliferation of settlements and the recent measures taken by Israel are tantamount to a de facto annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan and of the Gaza Strip. The refusal of Israel to recognize the national and inalienable right of the Palestinian people- to self-determination  including its right to establish an independent State in Palestine  in accordance with the Charter; to apply the relevant  resolutions on the right of return and the right to compensation of the Palestinians; to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and finally to evacuate all the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  which it cynically calls ""liberated Israeli territories""  that refusal of Israel  I repeat  aggravates the crisis and dangerously threatens world peace.272. Moreover  initiatives have been taken by the Security Council to bring Israel to recognize the political status of the Palestinians and to extend accordingly the scope of its resolution 242 (1967). Those initiatives  unfortunately  were met by the veto of a certain Power. It is imperative that the latter take into account the political support which the overwhelming majority of Member States lend to those initiatives.273.	With your permission  Mr. President  I should now like to speak of a question which is not  on the agenda but which in the view of my Government is a source of deep concern inasmuch as it contains all those elements which can at any time bring about a violent confrontation. I have in mind the question of Korea. Indeed  preparations for war  up to and including the maintenance of a sizable nuclear arsenal under the so-called Treaty for the protection of the Seoul regime  are being pursued methodically in the south of Korea. For its part the Government of the United States does not appear to have renounced its design to divide the Korean nation.274.	The General Assembly in its resolution 3390 B (XXX)  defined the framework for a political solution to this question. We call for the speedy application of that resolution as well as of the North-South joint communiqué of 4 July 1972  in order to speed up the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.275.	The conflicts and crisis situations which I have mentioned-grave in themselves—would not be that dangerous for international peace and security if they were not set against the background of a world armed to the teeth  possessing the necessary means to self-destruct several times over  and not safeguarded against an accident or an error in judgment that could at any moment bring about its annihilation. That is a state of affairs that hardly gives cause for optimism  particularly since we are only two years away from the end of the Disarmament Decade.276.	The relative failure of any programme for controlling armaments attests to one thing  namely  the attachment of Governments to the erroneous idea that equates the level of security with the level of armaments. Whether or not such an attitude is deliberate or subconscious does not change the fact that the general interest does not lie in the ever-growing sophistication of the conventional and nuclear arsenals of the major and the super-Powers  in the dreaded horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons  or in a quantitative or qualitative expansion in the arms trade.277.	It is in this spirit that we shall participate in May 1978 in the deliberations of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We will do so because disarmament  desirable in itself  is one of the necessary conditions for the creation of an atmosphere of trust conducive to universal security. Its economic and social implications are evident; I will not dwell on them  except to say that it would be of great benefit to divert all or part of the $400 billion spent annually for military purposes to development activities  because the only battle that deserves to be waged is that which will liberate man and meet his cultural and material needs.278.	This liberation of man is a duty which each State has assumed under the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Democratic Republic of Madagascar has respected its commitments in this field by adhering to the two International Covenants on Human Rights  one on civil and political rights and the other on economic and social rights.279.	The means of their implementation  however  should fall under the jurisdiction of each State. It is up to each State to define its own priorities among the various rights. My delegation believes that for the developing countries priority should be given to economic and social rights  whose very existence determines the enjoyment and effective exercise of all other rights and liberties. It is with this in mind that the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  dated 30 December 1975  stressed the priority of those economic and social rights  and reaffirmed as well respect for other fundamental freedoms. In the final analysis  what is important is the will to apply the Universal Declaration and the Covenants  and it is inadmissible that a State or a group of States  regardless of its power  should usurp our right to be masters of. our conscience.280.	It has become a commonplace to say that political problems or problems of human rights  such as I have just analysed  cannot be taken out of their economic context  because it is easy to find  in any situation of conflict or tension  material interests at stake. This means that we attach great significance to the numerous and complex economic and financial issues included in the agenda of the United Nations and its specialized agencies  issues for which we hope a speedy and valid solution will be found.281.	In this connexion we should not like to overlook the efforts made by the Group of 77 to work out and submit coherent programmes for change in the economic relations and structures of the international c- immunity.282.	The Charter of Algiers  adopted 10 years ago  the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) on the new international economic order—to cite only a few instruments— attest to the constant concern of the third-world countries to put an end to the imperialist exploitation of these riches and manpower  to take into their own hands their economic destiny  to participate in decision-making which affects them and to condemn  reject and refuse all forms of coercive and discriminatory economic policy or practice.283.	These considerations will inspire us during this session  which is to consider to what extent the objectives contained in the resolutions on economic development and international economic co-operation have been implemented.284.	Nor shall we hide our concern regarding the impossibility we found during the resumed thirty-first session of arriving at a common assessment of the current world situation. Should we not make a tragedy of the fact that the Conference on International Economic Co-operation did not produce the desired results? For our part  we believe that the context  the scope of the matters taken up and the too-limited nature of the subjects discussed  as well as the absence of political will on the part of the Western States  could only lead to the failure of the Conference.285.	We are among those who believe that the United Nations system is the most representative and appropriate body to initiate  conduct and succeed in negotiations of a global nature on the establishment of a new international economic order. Thus  our Assembly will have to elaborate specific guidelines for relevant institutions of the system and ask them to abide by the principles and priorities which it defines.286.	In the forefront of our priority concerns is the problem of raw materials. We deplore the lack of understanding of certain Western States which .still voice reservations about the. objectives  modalities and elements of the common fund aimed at stabilizing the prices of raw materials coming from the developing countries. That instrument would make it possible to achieve the objectives of the Integrated Programme for Commodities called for by the producing countries of the third world.287.	We also wish to see the resumption of negotiations  in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the seventh special session of the General Assembly  on other important questions that have been left in abeyance  such as the search for global solutions to the problems of the indebtedness of the developing countries  reform of the international monetary system  and measures aimed at favouring the transfer of technology and promoting industries in the under-equipped countries.288.	Negotiations on those issues should lead to concrete measures inspired by the International Development Strategy and should not  as in the past  be confined to a search for palliatives contingent upon circumstances.289.	The picture of the international situation which I have just sketched before this Assembly might appear gloomy and pessimistic  and I hope that no one will take exception to the candour with which my delegation has endeavoured to view and comment on the realities of our time. After all  what good would it do to feign ignorance and not recognize the malaise that exists in relations among the members of the international community?290.	On the one hand  the world of reaction has not laid aside its objectives of domination and exploitation and even seeks to reverse the course of history. When it is asked to pronounce itself on matters of integration and accession to political and economic rights  it avows that it renounces confrontation  but in fact it takes refuge in empiricism. The result is a series of hesitations  delays  imprecision and harmful improvisations in the development of normal international relations.291.	On the other hand  the forces of progress  to which we belong  firmly believe in the inevitability of the triumph 306of liberation over oppression  in the building of an international society of justice  equality and social progress  and struggle for the establishment of a new political and economic order.292.	To avoid a confrontation of those two trends firm commitments must he made and inconsistent policies have to be abandoned  and we must all recognize the need for joint efforts for the advent of a new world which would look quite different from the old world  of which it is not necessarily- the heir.293.	The choice between those two trends must be made in accordance with our determination to respect strictly the principles of the Charter and to work sincerely for the realization of its objectives.294.	If that is not done  the United Nations  a centre of consultation and harmonization  but above all a centre of truth  will no longer have its raison d’être."
"81",4467,"MDV",32,1977,"﻿66.	It is a pleasure for me to extend to you  Sir  my delegation's sincere congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We consider your election as a well-deserved tribute paid to you by the world body for your eminent qualities of statesmanship and experience  as well as added recognition of the prominent role played in world affairs by your country. My country  which maintains close links with Yugoslavia  particularly within the  non-aligned movement  conveys to you  through me  its good wishes for success in your important deliberations.67.	Allow me also to express my Government's appreciation of the invaluable role played by your predecessor  Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  during his term of office as the President of the thirty-first session. I wish to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on the successful manner in which he discharged his onerous responsibilities.68.	I should also like to express my Government's deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his untiring and dedicated efforts to promote the objectives of the Organization.69.	This current session marks the admission of two new Members to our Organization: the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. My delegation welcomes with joy the two new Members in our midst  whose admission to our Organization is not only a further step towards the achievement of universality of the Organization but also a clear indication of the strength displayed by the peoples of those two countries in achieving self-determination and national independence. We are convinced that their presence in this family of nations will contribute positively towards peace and co-operation.70.	Maldives is among the community of nations a small nation which depends very much for its well-being and progress on the .principles of peace and international co-operation. We firmly believe that the United Nations system  despite its short-comings  has been and will continue to be the most vital instrument that the family of nations has so far evolved for the maintenance of peace and security in the world and for the promotion of the principles of freedom  justice and human dignity.71.	We realize that the problems which we face today are difficult  complex and of a considerable magnitude; but we hope that  with a greater sense of responsibility and our collective efforts  we shall be able to solve those problems. The implementation of the resolutions we adopt  and a genuine belief in and enthusiasm for the principles embodied in our Charter remain the key factors for the success of our deliberations. As our Secretary-General has said in 1976 in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:""The ... concept of world order is based on respect for the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations and for international law  principles and procedures.""72.	The framework for solutions to today's economic problems has already been laid down. The Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the resolution of the seventh special session on development and international economic cooperation can guide us  in our deliberations  towards the establishment of a new partnership between the developed and developing countries and of an effective relationship between nations based on the principles of interdependence and mutual respect. My country feels happy that  as a result of our deliberations within the United Nations system during the past few years  we are now able to identify a number of key issues involved in the process of achieving this new relationship. Despite the failure of the recent dialogue in Paris to live up to the expectations of the developing countries  Maldives is happy to see the evidence of an entirely new approach to development and the desire of the developed countries to create effective conditions for a better world economic order.73.	Allow me to mention some specific problems of my country pertaining to development. The most serious impediments are our meagre natural resources and the extreme fragmentation of the thousand-island archipelago ' which occupies nearly 100 000 square kilometres in the Indian Ocean. Fisheries and tourism are the only two major fields in which any viable activities can be immediately carried out. So far  Maldives has depended solely on its own limited resources and the bilateral assistance received from friendly countries. The effectiveness of United Nations- assisted programmes was in the past at a minimum  due to the lack of intensified programming to cater for the existing problems of the country. It is only now  because of the nature and urgency of our development needs  combined with the hard economic realities of our times  that we have embarked on projects which require relatively large funds. It is in this context that the Government of Maldives decided to join the IMF  the World Bank Group and the Asian Development Bank. Furthermore  the Government is also seeking assistance from other  similar sources. We are hopeful that with the support of these sources and agencies  and given a few more years to plan ahead  we will be able to catch the train and thereby be able to maintain an adequate momentum of progress to participate in the newly- constructed world economic order.74.	Turning to the major issues confronting the world as a whole  my delegation believes that the problem of disarmament in all its dimensions  particularly the question of controlling the nuclear arms race  remains most urgent. The dangers of recent developments in the field of armaments are beyond our 'imagination. My delegation hopes that the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament will achieve progress in the direction of complete disarmament  or at least free mankind from the perils of nuclear destruction. We strongly condemn the trend of thought which tries to justify the acquisition and use of nuclear weapons as a method of blackmail  even as the last resort for survival.75.	We in Maldives  as a freedom-loving and peace-loving country  view the question of southern Africa as another issue posing grave threats to world peace. In Zimbabwe  the right of the people to rule themselves is still being obstinately denied by the minority regime in Namibia  the illegal occupation of African soil by the Pretoria regime continues  and the right of the people to self-determination and independence continues to be ignored. In South Africa itself  the tragic results of the continuation of the abhorrent policy of apartheid are being seen in the form of the massacres of the African population in Soweto and other places. Recent developments in South Africa have again demonstrated that the denial of the basic human rights of peoples will only lead to destruction and total unhappiness. Maldives will continue to support the United Nations in its efforts to change the situation in southern Africa  and we reiterate our solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa in their just struggle for human rights and independence.76.	The situation m the Middle East remains a grave disappointment to the people of Maldives. On earlier occasions  my delegation has clearly indicated its rejection of the illegal occupation by Israel of the Arab territories. I wish to reaffirm this position of my Government  which is based not only on an understanding of the historical factors involved  but also on our rejection of the idea of the acquisition of territories by war. We further deplore the flagrant violation of human rights carried out by the Israelis in the occupied territories through systematic efforts to change the demographic composition of Arab lands. We in Maldives  being a Moslem nation  are particularly hurt by the Israeli practices in Jerusalem aimed at changing the Islamic edifices in the Holy Land. My delegation also reiterates its support for the Palestinian people  who have the legitimate right to self-determination on their own national soil. We are convinced that the participation of their authentic representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization  is essential in any peace-making effort aimed at a just and lasting solution which will guarantee peace and security in the area.77.	As a maritime nation  Maldives pays special attention to the work and achievements of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law-of the Sea. It is of special significance in determining the status of the economic and maritime zones  defining the continental shelf and dealing with the problems related to marine environment.78.	We view the achievements of the last session of the Conference with optimism. It is hoped that the forthcoming session in Geneva will achieve a higher degree of co-ordination in order to conclude the task of the Conference.79.	The Indian Ocean washes the shores of most countries of Asia  including ours. We have joined hands with the countries of the region to make that ocean a zone of peace  free from great-Power rivalry and conflict.80.	Since the inception of the United Nations Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace we have supported all efforts made towards the practical implementation of that Declaration. Further  we are happy to note the interest expressed early this month by the United States and the Soviet Union in achieving practical results in their talks on this subject. We believe that their good will and co-operation will yield a significant degree of progress in this endeavour.81.	My. delegation remains deeply disturbed over the continued violation of the unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Comoros by foreign occupation of the Comorian island of Mayotte.82.	The question of Cyprus is another unsolved problem which has remained on our agenda for the last several years. My delegation supports all efforts in search of a negotiated and permanent settlement of the problem. We feel that any realistic solution should take into consideration the legitimate interests of all the ethnic groups of the Cypriot community  and that it should preserve the independence and territorial integrity of the nation.83.	Strengthening the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and security  fostering economic cooperation and harmonizing international action towards a better future is not an impossible task only if we are committed seriously to the principles of the Charter and if we can summon the will and sustain the courage to adjust the national interests to the changing perspectives of the world.84.	Once again I reiterate my country's faith in the United Nations and its firm commitment to the principles of the Charter.  wish to express my Government's hope that the work of the thirty-second sessions will be crowned with successful results compatible with the expectations of the peoples of the world. "
"82",4513,"MEX",32,1977,"﻿1.	 On behalf of Mexico I bring you the best wishes of its Constitutional President  Jose Lopez Portillo  for the success of this session of the General Assembly.7.	The fact that Mr. Mojsov is President of this Assembly guarantees impartiality and efficiency  given his high personal qualities and his country of origin  Yugoslavia  with which we have great affinity in the struggle for a better  more just and equitable world.8.	In the name of Mexico  1 also address my greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Waldheim  whose efforts to bring about world peace deserve our appreciation.9.	We also pay tribute to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the President of the thirty-first session and our efficient leader in the negotiations on the law of the sea.10.	We wish to express our most sincere congratulations to the delegations of Viet Nam and Djibouti on the occasion of the admission of their countries to membership of this world Organization. Permit me also to pay a special tribute to the brave Vietnamese people  whose struggle for freedom recalls the heroic feats of the Mexican people throughout their history.11.	Mexico has supported the United Nations since its foundation in June 1945 the ""sovereign Powers' supranational summit for ordering our affairs"" — and has supported its principles and purposes  inter alia the maintenance of international peace and security  the development of friendly relations among peoples  equal rights and the self-determination of peoples and international cooperation in solving international economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems  as well as the other noble goals defined in its original Charter.12.	Mexico has always been true to those purposes and principles. As President Jos6 Lopez Portillo stated in his first report to the Congress on 1 September 1977:""The world problems in which we are involved are not just evidence of a transitory and generalized disturbance  but a profound shaking of the present-day structure to its very roots  one that presages great changes in the economy  in culture  in relations among nations  and even among society  Man and Nature.""13.	In the 32 years since its foundation  the United Nations has had its successes and setbacks  it has suffered crises and known fear. It would have been difficult  in the short span of its existence  to alter vested interests and change the psychology of human beings. In the perspective of history  32 years is but an instant  during which great progress has been achieved by our international community  though much still remains to be done.14.	Nevertheless  the real problems of man are very often misconstrued and their place is taken by artificial problems. Sometimes some controversies are overemphasized to distract attention from more serious conflicts or else a ""smoke-screen"" of procedural and unimportant aspects of a question is created to dilute the essential objective of the developing countries  whose only aim should be  on the one hand  their economic  social  political and technological liberation  and  on the other  their physical  geopolitical and even mental decolonization. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the progress made within the United Nations  suggest possible future options and draw up new formulas to update our world Organization.15.	Consequently we need: first  to review the United Nations machinery and its functions; secondly  to update the United Nations  that is  deepen its democratic character  a goal sought by the proposal sponsored by Mexico and other countries; thirdly  to use the limited time at our disposal to discuss fundamental questions; and fourthly  to eliminate questions that evade the true problems of the peoples of the world. To achieve these ends  we need positive and concrete evidence of political will on the part of States  a will to take the utmost advantage of the resources at our disposal  not wasting energy or duplicating forums.16.	From the days of its first revolution in 1810 to its social revolution of 1910  which culminated in the Political Constitution of 1917  Mexico has maintained important ideals  among which are independence  the sovereignty of peoples  respect for the rights of others  decolonization and the optimum and sovereign use of natural resources  as well as a more equitable distribution of wealth.17.	In short  Mexico has stood for peace with liberty  an equitable world economy and universal social justice. We are aware of the fact that such ideals are difficult to attain; but we have patience.18.	In its international relations  Mexico's position is firm: we have indeed unwaveringly supported the same tried and true principles throughout our history  and we have always endeavoured to make them consistent with our domestic policy.19.	I now turn to Mexico's current domestic policy. The present public administration  which took office on 1 December 1976  has instituted a series of substantial reforms of the Mexican governmental system.20.	In essence  these reforms are based on the following factors: first  an important administrative reform  involving a reorganization of the Government  which will in turn organize the country; secondly  a political reform  aimed at streamlining our tried and stable democratic system  the result of the first social revolution of this century; thirdly  a fiscal  financial and monetary reform  which has quickly restored general confidence by reducing the public debt  stimulating national savings  fighting the sickness of our times—inflation-recession-and improving the tax system and promoting exports; fourthly  the organization  to spur production and productivity  of an ""Alliance for Production""  wherein employees and management  with the collaboration of the State  enter into agreements—the former to exercise self-restraint in the matter of wage increases  and the latter to endeavour to reduce prices and costs  thus forestalling the inflationary spiral; and fifthly  the stimulation of the oil and petrochemical industries  which will ensure Mexico's healthy short-term and long- term development.21.	In this respect  it is well known that Mexico's proven oil reserves are such that it ranks thirteenth among the 68 oil-producing countries of the world  and if probable reserves are taken into account  it will eventually rank tenth. In May 1977  we produced 1 million barrels a day and we exported one sixth of our production. The reserves-to-production ratio is 27 years  higher than the international rate  aside from any of the expected new discoveries In other words  Mexico will become a relatively important oil producer in the world. At the end of this year  Mexico will be exporting 290 000 barrels per day  after internal consumption has been adequately covered. By 1982  it will be producing large quantities of gas from newly discovered oil fields. In short  Petroleos Mexicanos contributes to the ""Alliance for Production"" and materially assists the economic liberation of Mexico.22.	The Sixth factor is that Mexico has also other important sources of energy  and their rational exploitation is currently being studied.23.	The Seventh factor is the launching of a reform of the agricultural sector through a co-ordination of effort  a reduction of costs to restore the small owner's confidence and .the introduction of guaranteed prices for basic agricultural products.24.	The Eighth factor is that  through such measures  the production of staple foods for the people of Mexico has been stimulated  and international support has been sought for the establishment of a common fund within the framework of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. With the support of certain Latin American and African countries  an agreement has been reached for the establishment of a fund for the stabilization of coffee.25.	One of the problems that Mexico shares with other countries in the world is the population explosion  with all its inherent complications. With this in mind  the new administration has established a Ministry for Human Settlements  an Urban Development Commission  the National System for the Full Development of the Family  and the National Co-ordinating Agency for Family Planning.26.	We seek  in particular  to reduce the population explosion through persuasion  heavily backed by a national education plan designed for the modern world. Old taboos are fought by the use of new methods and our problems  which are the same as in other parts of the world  can be solved since we have the material and human resources to draw on.27.	Science and technology hold pride of place in my country's aspirations  and during the analysis of the problems of raw materials  development and financing  at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  known as the North-South dialogue  we insisted on asking for the support of the rich countries in the form of adequate  not obsolete  technology. In my country  this matter is entrusted to an important government agency which keeps in close touch with the universities and technical institutes of Mexico and the world  as well as with the United Nations programmes.28.	Mexico attaches great importance to the physical and mental health of the Mexican people  in conjunction with social security. In this respect  large-scale programmes are in force  which are closely linked to those of the United Nations.29.	Thus  I have outlined the way in which the Mexican Government and the new generations in my country are preparing for the advent of the twenty-first century  which is just over the horizon.30.	A brief description of the essential aims of the domestic policy of the Government of President Jos6 Lopez Portillo  is as follows: first  more and better economic confidence  inside and outside the country; secondly  more and better education; thirdly  more and better production and productivity; fourthly  more and better health; fifthly  more and better family planning; sixthly  more and better fiscal  monetary and financial management; seventhly  a larger and better democratic and social system; eighthly  more and better public administration; ninthly  more and better individual and social justice; and tenthly  more and better international relations.31.	On the international scene  Mexico has always endorsed certain basic principles which are the result of its history: non-intervention of one State in the domestic affairs of another; the self-determination of peoples; the pacific settlement of disputes  with its complement  the abstention from the threat or use of force; and the sovereign equality of States.32.	We support the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and important documents which define the scope of those principles  such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples; the Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations; and the approved guidelines for the establishment of the new international economic order  whose implementation cannot be postponed.33.	We also observe the treaties and conventions of an international character  which are an integral part of the Magna Carta of Mexico  as provided for in its article 133.34.	Furthermore  President Jose Lopez Portillo has stated that his Government will abide by the golden rule of international relations: ""Treat others as you would wish to be treated""  which is  in other words  the great phrase of Juarez: ""Among individuals as among nations alike  the respect for the rights of others means peace"".35.	To summarize  the general framework of Mexico's international policy is as follows: respect for the rights of others and observance of its own historical principles  which in essence coincide with those of the United Nations Charter and other important related documents; and friendship and reciprocity—on an equal basis—with all peoples of earth.36.	During the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly  which concluded its work a few days ago  we noted how the points addressed at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation reverted to their natural forum: the United Nations. We hope that  as a result of this experience  we shall no longer in future have meetings convened for particular reasons or special points of interest  which only serve to district attention and consume the energy required for more urgent purposes.37.	At the last ministerial meeting of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  I had the honour of stating on Mexico's behalf:""If the Conference had succeeded in helping to provide a more just system of remuneration for the basic products exported by the developing countries  it would have contributed to solving one of the major defects of the present international structure; if it had established solid bases for undertaking a true reform of the international monetary system and of development financing  it would have helped to eliminate a serious cause of tension; if it had effectively facilitated the transfer of technology and access to markets for the industrial products of the developing countries  it would have brought about urgently needed changes in the productive structures of those countries; and  lastly  if it had considered nationalsovereignty as the basic condition for any viable system of international co-operation I would have speeded up one of the tasks that has consumed more time and effort during this century than any other.""38.	I went on to say-that under those circumstances we should now undertake to make new efforts  using all the means at our disposal  through international organizations and bilaterally  to implement the socio-economic order that the world requires today. This is a task in which the United Nations has an important role to play  through the activities of its relevant bodies.39.	Once again I repeat that our fundamental duty is to keep alive the spirit of co-operation  despite the not-very- encouraging results of the Paris Conference.35. The highest priority of the international community must be given to the task of finding ways and means of implementing the new international economic order  the basic concepts of which were defined by the United Nations. Putting this new economic order into operation will settle many social and political problems through a better and wiser distribution of the world's wealth. Moreover  it will lead to the establishment of universal social justice.36. The Declaration adopted yesterday at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 [see Aj32j244j represents the objective view of the Group as a whole that the most significant part of the new world order needs still to be established.37.	Since the adoption by the General Assembly on 10 December 1948 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights  the protection of these rights has become the responsibility of the international community. That Declaration defined the dignity and worth of the human person as the loftiest aspiration for the advent of a world delivered from fear and poverty  from tyranny and oppression  where the fundamental freedoms are guaranteed.38.	Since the time of Hidalgo and Morelos  the heroes of our independence  Mexico has fought for those noble principles  which cannot be understood except within the context of social rights. Those rights have achieved a new and permanent effect.39.	Mexico firmly supports without reservation the adoption of adequate measures to strengthen the protection of human rights and will insist that they be  first  implemented in strict compliance with the conventions in force on the subject or with the appropriate decisions adopted by the United Nations  and secondly  applied  without discrimination of any kind  to all human beings  even to those who for socio-economic reasons are temporarily compelled to abandon their countries of origin.40.	I now wish to speak about science and technology  the transfer of technology and the effective transfer of resources to the developing countries.41.	Within the framework of scientific and technological co-operation  I should like to stress the importance of the preparation for the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development for whose headquarters Mexico has offered its capital. This Conference will provide an excellent opportunity for examining the activities aimed at directing and promoting science and technology so that they become an instrument for the collective development of all countries and for the solution of the problems of employment  food  and income distribution  and for the increase of the productive capacity and of the exports of the developing countries.42.	Science and technology must  in our view  be an instrument in the service of mankind and not the tool of selected elements  which would  paradoxically  reduce the capacity for development of the majority of the population of the world  while enhancing the growth and potential of a privileged minority. Science and technology must be dedicated to Eros  not to Thanatos  which would mean the destruction of unimaginably vast areas which would affect both man and the environment as in the case of the so-called neutron bomb  the last in the chain of diabolical destructive weapons.43.	The United Nations system must bring to bear its full support so that developing countries may take advantage as far as possible of every opportunity for reinforcing and increasing their own real economic capacity.44.	Mexico  as the Depositary Government of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco  appreciates the full value of the gesture made by James E. Carter  President of the United States of America  when on 26 May of this year he personally signed Additional Protocol I of that instrument  whereby the countries of our region brought about the establishment of the first nuclear-free zone encompassing heavily populated areas. We feel that as a matter of priority Latin America should bring this instrument into full force as soon as possible.45.	In accordance with the decision adopted last year  the General Assembly will meet in the spring of 1978 for a special session on disarmament. For the first time in the history of the United Nations  the international community will have the opportunity of making a thorough and exhaustive- review of the question—as its importance requires and indeed demands-including the reasons for the unfruitfulness of the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  which meets in Geneva.46.	World military expenditure  estimated at more than $350 billion annually  has reached levels never before attained in peacetime. The waste of resources that this represents  added to the ever greater diversion to military purposes of the work of so many technicians and experts whose efforts are essential to development  is the best justification for taking immediate and concerted action. furthermore  the cumulative destructive power of the nuclear arsenals is such that their mere existence constitutes a danger of universal suicide 47.	While acknowledging the special responsibility of the military Powers for taking disarmament measures  we nevertheless wish to express once again our concern at the fact that such important negotiations as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] should take place outside theUnited Nations. This does not prevent us from taking note with interest of the declaration made by the United States of America and the Soviet Union in Washington on 24 September 1977  whereby both countries reaffirmed their determination to extend the obligations of the 1972 SALT agreements. Even though we have always considered those agreements of a very limited nature  we hope that such evidence of accord will augur well for the forthcoming adoption of effective disarmament measures.48.	One of the permanent elements of Mexico's foreign policy has been to endeavour by all means at its disposal to halt the arms race  to eliminate nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction and to strive to see to it that real measures are taken to bring us closer to the final objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.49.	Moreover  in conjunction with Sweden and Yugoslavia  we have initiated action aimed at the early adoption of conventions limiting or prohibiting certain conventional weapons having cruel and indiscriminate effects.50.	Mexico  as President Lopez Portillo has reiterated  has a history of struggle against colonialism and its vestiges. It will endeavour to see to it that the decisions adopted this year on the subject of physical colonialism  geopolitical colonialism and mental colonialism fully  safeguard the responsibility of the United Nations and comprise prompt action for the elimination of colonialism  including the application of enforcement action  as mentioned in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Apart from the struggle against physical or geopolitical colonialism  Mexico is also aware of the need to fight against mental colonialism.51.	I turn now to the question of the law of the sea. Mexico has actively participated in the sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  determined to help to make its work as great a success as possible. We note with appreciation that  in contrast to what happened at the fifth session  it was possible at this session to advance the work of finding solutions of the problems that still stand in the way of our reaching the objective that we have set for ourselves  namely  the adoption of a maritime code. We particularly welcome the fact that the text of article 55 of the informal single negotiating text now defines the legal status of the exclusive economic zone as a zone subject to specific international law and not included in the definition of the high seas or of territorial waters. Likewise  the rights of coastal States within that zone have been more clearly defined. Substantial progress was also achieved in the area of scientific research  and partial progress in that area pertaining to the pacific settlement of disputes. Finally  we consider that some advance was made in the search for solutions of one of the main problems confronting the Conference concerning the resources that are the common heritage of mankind  namely  how to exploit the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.52.	We trust that at the seventh session  which is due to take place next spring  all States will continue to strive to reach an agreement on matters that are still outstanding. We must bear in mind that  unless we adopt a code of the sea  the oceans will fall prey to anarchy.53.	The early conclusion of agreements on the law of the sea  the transnational companies  the transfer of technology  a new strategy for development that will contribute to the full implementation of the new international economic order  machinery that will ensure the faithful protection of human rights are all matters to which we must devote our efforts.54.	Following a proposal of Costa Rica and Mexico  several countries met recently at San Jose in Costa Rica to rationalize and to regulate the fishing of the yellow-fin tuna. Good results are expected to come from the Mexican and Costa Rican proposals.55.	Mexico is located in the northern portion of the American continent and  in equal sovereignty and dignity  it has increased its relations with the United States  with which it has established a modus operandi for handling common problems  in view of the fact that we share a border of 3 000 kilometres. We are also entering a new era of diplomacy with Canada. After all  Canada lies north of the colossus and we to the south of it.56.	In essence  our problems relating to the United States are  though different  of a common nature. In the first place  the United States has not had a consistent policy of mutual understanding and agreement with Latin America. On the other hand  neither has Latin America had a permanent and mature policy with respect to the United States.57.	But worst of all  Latin America has not had a continuous and understanding policy with respect to Latin America itself. These are theses advanced by the President of Mexico  Jose Lopez Portillo. In all cases  but particularly in the case of Latin America's policy regarding Latin America  we must unify our positions. While ideologies or political systems may still divide us  we must seek  whenever possible  our own similarities and not our differences. Our weakness has been our disunity.58.	Efforts  however  are being made in connexion with United States policies with regard to Latin America which seem to be improving. This is evidenced vis-à-vis Mexico by the signing of Additional Protocols I and II to the Treaty of Tlatelolco and by Mexico's recovery of the Ojinaga salient and vis-à-vis the rest of Latin America by the signing of the two treaties of Panama and the Additional Protocol.59.	In the last-mentioned case  that of Panama  Mexico has maintained that the Republic of Panama had to recover unconditionally full sovereignty over its own territory.60.	With regard to Latin America itself  the first attempt at holding a high-level meeting was made in Bogota on 6 August 1977  with the participation of the Presidents or Heads of Government of various Latin American countries: Mexico in North America; Costa Rica and Panama in Central America; Jamaica in the Caribbean; and Colombia and Venezuela in South America. It was an experience worth repeating  particularly in order to reinforce the bonds of brotherhood with Latin America  with which we have cultural and historical links.61.	Among the subjects discussed at the Bogota meeting  which I have just mentioned  I should like to stress the consensus that emerged on the need to find a just and prompt solution of the problem of Belize  on the basis of the principles that were reaffirmed at the Conference  in particular  that of the right to self-determination. I take this opportunity of expressing once again our firm hope that  until such time as a solution is found  neither of the parties directly involved in the conflict will attempt to resolve it unilaterally  thus endangering peace in the region.62.	After a suspension of 40 years  diplomatic relations have now been resumed with territorial Spain. Relation with the Spanish Republic in exile  from which we inherited many democratic and cultural teachings  had previously been terminated. Thus  two peoples bound by ties of affection have been reunited  diplomatically and fraternally.63.	Peace is one and indivisible. This Organization has received the historical trust of defending it and preserving it  which means that it must seek  through negotiation and conciliation  acceptable formulas based on mutual respect.64.	There is no doubt that the Middle East situation is one of the main threats to international peace  and this fact places the Assembly under the obligation of giving the matter the required priority and of taking effective steps to find a way that will lead to a just settlement of the problem. Mexico endorses an early convening of the Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation not only of all the parties directly concerned and of the super-Powers but also of a limited and representative number of other States whose participation could help in the achievement of a viable solution of the problem. We confirm our support of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) as the soundest base on which to seek a just solution of the problem.65.	One of the areas where the United Nations has achieved its greatest success is the decolonization of the modern world. Yet we are now confronted with an impasse with regard to possible action by the Organization to solve the three fundamental problems in that area  namely  the refusal by the minority Government of Zimbabwe- Rhodesia—to transfer power to the majority; the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and the need to find ways and means for the United Nations Council for Namibia to fulfil its mandate; and the policy of apartheid of the South African Government. Mexico demands that a prompt settlement of these urgent problems be encouraged.66.	Despite the efforts that have been made within the framework of the Organization  there still remains much to be done before women are fully integrated into the development process as equal partners with men.67.	In each of our countries  efforts are being made to attain that end. In Mexico  we have eliminated all traces of discrimination from our laws-that is to say that there is no legal difference between the opportunities afforded to men and those afforded to women in Mexican society.68.	We must now eradicate discrimination from our daily attitudes  from our way of thinking  and allow women the same rights as men  giving them equal treatment not only in our laws but also in social and economic reality.69.	The United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace is the culmination of a process  the basis of which was laid during the World Conference of the International Women's Year  which took place in Mexico City in 197570.	Mexico is bound by friendship to all the peoples of the earth. We strive to increase that friendship. Our relations with countries of diverse ideologies and different levels of development could not be better. We are part of the developing world  whose ideals we share.71.	The United Nations represents a positive effort at a rational solution of world problems. The means offered cover the economic  political and social fields.72.	Nations and individuals alike often repeat the same patterns of conduct even though such patterns may be self-destructive or tend to destroy others. This may be due to a lack of knowledge or understanding of the deep causes that motivate such conduct and the struggles between the impulses that govern behaviour. This accounts for the marked contrast between the rational  conscious  and apparent objectives and the incontrovertible reality of events.73.	We express the hope that in this forum mankind will be able to blend the sum of knowledge derived from a multidisciplinary effort and  under the aegis of humanitarianism  use the wisdom thus gained to ensure full survival of the human species on this earth.

"83",4608,"MLI",32,1977,"﻿51.	Mr. President  your outstanding election to the presidency of the thirty-second session is  above all  a well-deserved tribute to you in your personal capacity and to the role which your country has played and continues to play in the international arena in order to bring about a world of justice  peace and progress for all.52.	I should like to recall in this regard that President Tito  the founder of socialist Yugoslavia  is one of the initiators of the easing of the tense political climate in the world and of the affirmation of the role of the third world on the international plane. History will remember him as one of the great men of our time.53.	Yugoslavia which  like Mali  is a founding member of the non-aligned movement was one of the first European countries to support the cause of the colonial and oppressed peoples  who have all benefited from its political  moral and material support in their struggles for freedom and independence.54.	Permit me  therefore  to convey to you  Mr. President  the warm and friendly congratulations of my delegation. My country  Mali  which enjoys excellent relations with Yugoslavia  cannot but be gratified at the choice of our Assembly. We are thus assured beforehand of the success of our work. Your personal qualities and your great experience of international life are guarantees of that. My delegation wishes  for its part  to assure you of its loyal and active co-operation.55.	I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate  on behalf of the delegation of Mali  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who displayed such great competence in the conduct of the proceedings of the thirty-first session and in his guidance of the difficult debates of that session. The remarkable way in which he discharged his lofty functions does him much credit. We should like here to convey to him our fraternal gratitude.56.	I would not like to end this part of my statement without conveying our warm congratulations to Mr. Kurt Waldheim upon his well-deserved re-election to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. In renewing its confidence in him  the thirty-first session expressed to him the great appreciation of the international community for his distinguished services to the cause of peace and understanding among peoples and nations. That eloquent testimony of satisfaction is  without doubt  the best possible tribute which could be paid to a man of duty like Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who today embodies in the eyes of the world the aspirations and hopes of mankind.57.	By inaugurating its proceedings with the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the thirty-second session of the General Assembly intended thereby to highlight the event. This solemn public welcome to the international community constitutes an eloquent tribute to two fraternal countries which have won their independence by a noble struggle. The admission of those two new Members has brought the United Nations closer to one of its fundamental objectives  namely universality  while enriching it at the same time.58.	The Government of Mali  through me  wishes particularly to hail this new victory of heroic Viet Nam  a symbol of resistance against foreign domination  which has written in the blood of its glorious martyrs the most glorious pages of the history of the liberation struggle of peoples.59.	My delegation bids welcome to the two sister delegations and assures them of its fraternal and militant co-operation.60.	In reviewing our actions since the last session  we note that no significant progress has been made in the settlement of the serious problems facing the international community for decades now  whether it be the matter of safeguarding peace or the great economic and social challenges threatening the world.61.	Indeed  disarmament  which is the very foundation of that true peace to which humanity aspires  remains a remote objective—indeed  an uncertain one. The meagre results achieved so far relate only to the limitation of strategic arms or the prohibition of outmoded and outdated weapons. New and ever more sophisticated devices of mass destruction continue to appear in the arsenals of the world. That prompted the Secretary-General in his report to note that the agreements concluded so far in the field of nuclear disarmament have more to do with the regulation of competition between the militarily great Powers than with disarmament itself. He also stresses that the number of nuclear warheads has increased fivefold in the past eight years.67.. We should add to this the fact that  according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies  military expenditure in 1977 amounted to $375 billion  or 5 per cent of the gross national product of the world. That was an increase of 25 per cent over 1974.68.	As we can see  the arms race continues and even gathers momentum both quantitatively and technologically. It gives employment to 25 per cent of the world's scientists and swallows up 40 per cent of budgets devoted to development research.69.	That unfortunate tendency cannot  however  be justified  because stockpiles of nuclear arms possessed by the various nuclear Powers are enough to destroy  not a country or a continent  but the whole planet several times over. That is a tragedy. Those monstrous arsenals have not been accumulated and developed for the defence needs of their national territories but  rather  to demonstrate their material superiority. They constitute the sceptres of supremacy—and what sceptres they are! —for the potentates of our world  who none the less remain exposed like everyone else to the holocaust that faces mankind  because it is a fact that in nuclear warfare there are no winners; all the belligerents are losers.70.	The peace we seek is incompatible with the over- armament that we are witnessing. The campaign against what is known as the arms trade in the world  that is to say  against the supply of conventional weapons to developing countries for their security needs  is only a diversion in the face of the proliferation and frenzied perfecting of devices of mass destruction.71.	Indeed  the arms race between the great military Powers  far from waning  is spiralling ever upwards at a dizzying rate. New generations of murderous weapons are being developed. The monopoly of the nuclear secret has been broken.72.	The frenzied arms race of the great military Powers has left no other choice to those who refuse to shelter under their atomic ""umbrellas"" because they are jealous of their sovereignty and independence. Thus  in spite of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the proliferation of nuclear weapons has accelerated  both horizontally and vertically  while their dissemination has been actively continuing on all continents  against the will of the peoples. According to the estimates of experts whose authority cannot be questioned  20 to 30 new States will be joining the nuclear club before the end of the century. That is indeed frightening.73.	It is time therefore that we decided to put behind us this illusion of peace which we seem to have been harbouring since the end of the last world war. Resting essentially on the precarious balance of terror  it carries within itself the seeds of a conflagration that could be fatal for mankind. Let us therefore  before it is too late  strive to free the world from the nightmare of cosmic suicide in which it has been living since the advent of the atomic age. We must renounce  first of all  the use or threat of force in the settlement of disputes which might arise between States  because real disarmament can be contemplated only within a climate of confidence.74.	The abolition of ""strategic frontiers""  the dismantling of the death-dealing bases scattered throughout the world and a freeze on the production and development of new types of weapons would be an important step towards that objective.75.	Disarmament is a problem of concern to all countries  great and small  and in our view the United Nations offers the most appropriate framework for dealing with it.76.	In spite of their merits  the negotiations begun outside the United Nations-such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  the Talks on mutual and balanced force reductions and so on—cannot bring us to true disarmament. The most that they can lead to would be arrangements or bilateral or multilateral understandings relating to peripheral aspects of the question.77.	My delegation  for its part  sets great store by the special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on disarmament  to be held in the spring of 1978  in the course of which all of us will have not only to put forth our respective points of view objectively but also to take responsible decisions on this important question which has been of constant concern to the community of nations since the period between the two wars.78.	Because- of the implacable law of the interdependence of our society  there can be no oasis of peace in our world until we have banished from our conduct all recourse to arms. The last Arab-Israeli war of October 1973  which brought humanity to the brink of nuclear confrontation  is a tragic reminder of this.79.	Detente between East and West  which succeeded the cold war  can be viable only if it transcends the framework of Europe alone. It must be extended to all continents if it is to lead to the true peace so much aspired to by humanity.80.	That is why we must be determined to extinguish the existing hotbeds of war and tension which are being aggravated in the Middle East  Cyprus  Asia and in southern Africa.81.	With regard to the first  the Middle East crisis has persisted for 30 years. Successive Israeli Governments in Tel Aviv have striven to thwart all attempts at settlement by our Organization.82.	After having occupied the western part of Palestine by force  in which they had established—with  unfortunately  the sanction of the United Nations—a Jewish national home  the Zionists have put their time to good use by spilling over their territorial frontiers which the arbitrary partition plan of 29 November 1947 granted to their State  by successively annexing by force  in the name of the threadbare myth of ""greater Israel""  western Galilee and the towns of Nazareth  Ramla  Lydda  Jaffa  Beer Sheva and the Holy City of Jerusalem. By violating the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  and the relevant United Nations resolutions  they have hastened to extend Israeli citizenship unilaterally to the inhabitants of these territories. It will not be long before they take military occupation of the whole of the West Bank of Jordan  the territory of Gaza  Sinai and the Golan Heights by taking advantage of their treacherous and criminal aggression of June 1967.83.	Basing themselves this time on the false thesis of the so-called ""legal vacuum""  they will evolve and methodically put into effect a programme of integration for these territories  culminating in the adoption of the Sharon plan  named after the Minister for Agriculture of the Begin Government  who was its initiator. It is certainly worth pointing out here that that gentleman is also the Chairman of the Interministerial Commission for the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank of the Jordan. The purpose of that plan is to bring about the immigration of more than 2 million Jews of the Diaspora into this territory in order to change its demographic  economic and social structures and complete the work of its outright annexation to the Zionist State by infiltration and the forced assimilation of the Palestinians. Already more than 70 of these squatter settlements have been implanted in the West Rank by the Israeli Government.84.	Following the parliamentary elections of May 1977  which put his party  the Likud  into power in Tel Aviv  the Prime Minister  Mr. Begin  hastened to the Kaddum camp  Torah in hand  to proclaim to the inhabitants of this Jewish settlement: ""We are here to stay"". On 6 July 1977  that is  a few months later  General Sharon  to whom I have already referred  had the Interministerial Commission for the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank of the Jordan  of which he was Chairman  sanction the existence of three squatter settlements of the members of the ""Block of Faith"" - Maalei-Adumin  Osra and the famous Kaddum camp-through the Interministerial Commission for the establishment of settlements. His response to the general disapproval which this illicit operation aroused in the world was to create five further Jewish settlements on the West Bank. He revealed that to the     the official organ of the supporters of ""Greater Israel""  of the ""historic fatherland""  in the following terms: ""We are not a Government which is content to talk. Five settlements have been established without any publicity."" To the National Broadcasting Company  he stated: ""We shall continue colonization. We shall never release Judea and Samaria.""85.	We shall not revert here to the question of the permanent persecution of the peoples of the occupied territories by the Israeli authorities  nor shall we go into the repression  the acts of reprisal  the dynamiting of houses  deportations  extortions and humiliations which are their daily lot  because these barbarous acts are well known to all. The reports of United Nations bodies  international agencies and private humanitarian groups have given sufficient account of them to make it unnecessary to dwell on the question.86.	That is the response of the Zionist Government of Tel Aviv to the relevant resolutions adopted by our Organization for the settlement of the grave crisis in the Middle East. It is this language of refusal  this language of scorn towards the international community  which Israel has invariably employed for 30 years in reply to the constructive proposals made for the restoration of peace in this area. While the Palestinian people have been holding out the olive branch  the Zionist Government has been sighting its rifles.87.	The machinery of settlement has been blocked because of Israel's unjustified intransigence. During this time  more than 2 million Palestinians have continued to endure their Calvary in exile or under military occupation.88.	Today the prospects are much worse  with the advent of the Likud Government in Tel Aviv. One could not expect any less from Mr. Begin and his friends  whose party has this motto: ""Jordan has two banks; one belongs to us  and so does the other."" No slogan could better illustrate the spirit of expansionism and annexation of the new leaders of Israel.89.	The general uproar with which the official circles in Tel Aviv greeted the joint Soviet-American statement of 1 October 1977  which in any case is merely a partial reproduction of the decisions of our Organization on the serious crisis in the Middle East  is quite revealing in this respect.90.	The persistent hostilities in south Lebanon provoked by the Israelis could degenerate into a general war in that region at any moment  because the Palestinian and Arab peoples who have been deprived of their land and their property have had to wait for 30 years.91.	The grave risks to international peace and security which have been caused by the latest confrontation between Israel and the Arabs make it necessary for our Organization to shoulder its responsibilities by implementing the relevant decisions which it has taken on the question.92.	The restoration of peace in the Middle East necessarily involves the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territory and the restoration to the Palestinian people of its national rights. The General Assembly has reaffirmed that forcibly in several resolutions. With the exception of Israel  the truth of that statement is recognized by the entire international community. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 should therefore be modified to remove any possible misunderstanding about this.93.	The explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East demands the immediate resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties  including that of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.94.	I cannot leave the Mediterranean area without mentioning my delegation's concern over the crisis in Cyprus. Here again  in the past year no progress has been made towards a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.95.	The hopes which were aroused at the beginning of the year by the meeting  under the auspices of the Secretary- General of the United Nations  between the heads of the two communities  the late President Makarios and Mr. Denktas  were swiftly dissipated following the freezing of the intercommunal negotiations in Vienna. As we are reminded by the Secretary-General  the situation remains very serious. Therefore  the parties must refrain from any unilateral action which might lead to confrontation between the two communities.96.	In the light of the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly  the Secretary-General should continue his efforts to seek a basis for a just and lasting settlement based on the safeguarding of the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and policy of non-alignment of the country. We make an urgent appeal to all of the parties interested in and concerned with the Cypriot conflict to give him their support in carrying out his task.97.	The Korean crisis is one of the most persistent sequels of the last World War. It is an active hotbed of dissension which may erupt at any moment onto the Asian continent  as a result of the involvement of external forces in this wholly internal conflict. Powerful foreign military bases have been set up in the southern part of the country. That is why the General Assembly  at its thirtieth session  adopted resolution 3390 B (XXX)  putting an end to the existence of the so-called United Nations Command in Korea  under cover of which foreign troops had been operating in that country.98.	In spite of this firm decision  the Power involved in the Korean crisis continues to maintain there  against the will of its people  an army of 40 000 men on a war footing as well as military bases equipped with nuclear arms. The climate  therefore  is fraught with danger for the Asian continent. Only the implementation of resolution 3390 B (XXX)  which I have mentioned  can dispel this evil and promote the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea  which is  above all  a matter of United Nations responsibility. At the thirty-second session the General Assembly should see to it that this task is tackled.99.	The southern part of Africa constitutes one of the most virulent hotbeds of tension in the world because of the colonialists and white racists who have usurped power there. War is already raging there and insecurity is rife. That racial confrontation is liable to set fire to the whole region. The armed acts of aggression that are constantly committed against Mozambique  Zambia  Botswana and Angola by the troops of the white racists of Pretoria and the rebels of Salisbury reveal to us the magnitude of the tragedy.100.	The United Nations cannot remain indifferent in the face of the aggravation of the situation. Our Assembly must contemplate  in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter  energetic measures to put down the racist and rebel regimes of southern Africa  which have remained indifferent to all the exhortations and condemnations of our Organization.101.	At this stage we cannot  obviously  take into account in our assessment of the situation either the Anglo- American plan for Southern Rhodesia or the initiatives of the five Western Powers for the decolonization of Namibia  because those moves do not involve the responsibility either of the United Nations or of the OAU. The liberation movements will therefore continue their liberation struggles until the capitulation of the segregationists of Pretoria and Salisbury.102.	The Anglo-American plan  although it has some negative and ambiguous aspects could  in our view  serve as a basis for negotiation between the United Kingdom  the administering Power  and the Patriotic Front  the only legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe.103.	As to the initiatives of the five Western Powers for the decolonization of Namibia  we are following them with the greatest attention.104.	Vorster's earlier untoward actions and his procrastination in the negotiations under way do not encourage us to be optimistic. We should recall that in order to be valid  any agreement must take account of the conditions laid down by the OAU for the decolonization of Namibia  namely: respect for the territorial integrity of the country; the liberation of all political prisoners and detainees; the return of all Namibians in exile; the withdrawal of theSouth African administration and army from the Territory; the recognition of SWAPO as the legitimate representative of the Namibian people; and free general elections under the supervision of the United Nations.105.	It should be made clear that Namibia must accede to independence within the limits of its original  that is to say its colonial  frontiers. The enclave of Walvis Bay  which has been arbitrarily attached to South Africa by the Pretoria Government because of its privileged position on the Atlantic Ocean  is therefore an integral part of Namibian territory.106.	My delegation takes note of the code of conduct for European companies operating in South Africa adopted last month by the members of the European Economic Community. Although the reasons for this decision are praiseworthy  we .do not think that the measures advocated can really contribute to the elimination of apartheid or  to use the very words of Mr. Owen  their initiator  undermine ""the principle of apartheid.107.	International observers  incidentally  consider that it would be difficult for European companies which have been established in South Africa to respect the code because they have to reckon with the laws of the country  which many of them hesitate to violate. Furthermore  experience has proved sufficiently to us that limited measures are ineffective against the racist regime of Pretoria because of the very fact that they are easily circumvented. They can only encourage that country in its obstinacy and braggadocio.108.	Is it not because of the clamour which has arisen more or less everywhere in the world in denunciation and condemnation of the segregationist policy of his Government that Vorster has proclaimed the new Constitution of South Africa  which takes no account whatsoever of the existence of the black majority-that is to say  the 18 million indigenous people  who make up three quarters of the population?109.	My delegation considers that to deal a blow at the very foundations of apartheid  the Governments of Western Europe which are the principal partners of that country should be resolute in extending their means of pressure to include an economic  commercial  political and military embargo. Indeed  the crimes of the racists of Pretoria must encourage us to deal with them more severely.110.	This is the proper place for my delegation to commemorate one of the latest victims of the henchmen of Vorster and Kruger. I have in mind the martyr Steven Biko  the prestigious  authoritative leader of the Black Consciousness Movement  cut down in the flower of his youth in the course of his detention in a Johannesburg prison. He is the forty-first black political detainee murdered in the racist South African gaols. His sacrifice  far from dampening the enthusiasm of the young generations of black South Africans which have assaulted the bastion of apartheid  is making them ever more active.111.	My delegation is entirely in agreement with Mr. Vance  the Secretary of State of the United States  in saying that ""the three problems of Southern Rhodesia Namibia and apartheid must be dealt with simultaneously because they are interconnected"". I am quoting from the statement Mr. Vance made on 1 July 1977  at St. Louis  Missouri  before the Convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. I would add  however  that those three evils  which constitute a serious challenge to mankind  must be ruthlessly eliminated. That is why my delegation urges all Members of our Organization to engage in a frontal assault on them.112.	The declaration and the programme of action of the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo  Mozambique  in May 1977  and the declaration of the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos  Nigeria  in August 1977 s have produced an appropriate strategy in this regard.113.	I should not like to end this part of my statement on international peace and security without mentioning the fragmentation of the Comoros which is a matter of concern to Africa. The continued occupation by France of the island of Mayotte  which is an integral part of the Comorian group  is both a grave violation of the principles of the Charter and an act prejudicial to the doctrine of the OAU on the inviolability of frontiers inherited from the colonial regimes. The vast undertaking of decolonization on the part of France will be not completed in Africa until Mayotte is integrated into its motherland. We venture to hope that France will not remain indifferent to the appeals issued by Africa and the international community and it will restore the province of Mayotte to the Comoros.114.	The international economic situation is no better than the political situation. Inflation  recession and famine have continued to be rife throughout the world  particularly in the developing countries. The resurgence of protectionist policies in certain industrialized countries has disturbed the international economic situation even more.115.	Three years after the special session of the General Assembly  neither the Declaration nor the Programme of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order nor the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  have even begun to be put into effect. The official development assistance furnished by the members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has fallen from 0.36 per cent to 0.33 per cent of their gross national product  and total assistance to development  both official and private  has gone down by $0.4 billion  in absolute terms  while the target established for the Second United Nations Development Decade was 0.7 per cent of the gross national product. The indebtedness of the developing countries has reached the sum of $208 billion.116.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation in Paris  which had raised so much hope  ended its work after 18 months of arduous negotiation in semi-failure. No real progress was achieved in the restructuring of the international economic system. In a word  none of the challenges facing our world has really been met.117.	While the Paris Conference had the advantage of opening the first dialogue between the developed North and the under-developed South as to the future of international economic relations  we recognize that the industrialized countries did not entirely depart from their class spirit in the course of these latest negotiations.118.	The partial failure of the North-South dialogue in Paris was caused far less by the complexity of the problems dealt with than by the lack of political will in the industrialized countries  which  however  possess sufficient resources to help the world to meet the challenges facing it.119.	Indeed  we note in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization that:""For several years annual world military expenditure has been about $300 billion. By contrast the World Health Organization has spent about $83 million over 10 years to eradicate smallpox in the world—a sum insufficient to buy one modern supersonic bomber. That organization's programme for eradicating malaria at an estimated cost of $450 million—half of what is spent daily for military purposes-is dragging for lack of funds."" 120.	I would add that military expenditures in 1975 amounted to $210 billion and represented even at that time the total national incomes of the poor countries and 20 times the total assistance granted to developing countries.121.	The sums of money devoted in the world to military research are four times higher than those devoted to medical research.122.	In a word  this trend sacrifices development to armaments.123.	This dangerous development is giving rise to much concern in the world because of the very fact that it is taking us further away from the new international economic order which we have agreed to promote in order to meet the challenges inherent in the present system of economic and trade relations  which have been based upon hegemonistic concepts.124.	The tendency must be reversed if we do not want this change  which is unavoidable  to take place in an atmosphere of confrontation and chaos.125.	The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order has thus become an imperative.126.	Only dynamic international co-operation on the basis of effective solidarity and complementarity can help us to arrest the ills threatening our society.127.	-To do this  the General Assembly must take over from the North-South dialogue in Paris because the United Nations constitutes the best possible framework in which to negotiate the establishment of a new international economic order.128.	To give this rescue operation every chance of success  the industrialized countries must rid themselves of their caution and begin a dialogue with the developing countries on the basis of the relevant decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.129.	We also stand to gain by intensifying the debate on the relationship between disarmament and development.130.	Indeed  disarmament would release for development purposes vast financial  material and human resources.131.	The tasks of this thirty-second session of the General Assembly are therefore clear. It must above all strive to bring about significant progress both in regard to economic relations and in the fields of disarmament  the decolonization of southern Africa and the settlement of armed conflicts besetting the world. In other words  it must strive to unfreeze the situation and have the international community embark upon a process of renewal  that is to say  the building of a new international economic order  which alone can guarantee both individual and collective security.

"84",4696,"MMR",32,1977,"﻿153.	I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and to assure you of our support and cooperation as you discharge your high office.154.	At the same time  we pay a tribute to the President of the thirty-first session of the Assembly  Ambassador Amerasinghe  for the dignity and distinction with which he steered the work of that session.155.	This year we are happy to see the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam swelling our ranks. After a heroic struggle for over three decades to gain acceptance as a unified legitimate entity in the international community  Viet Nam has achieved at last its rightful and deserved place in our family of nations. Its admission to the United Nations signifies a positive step towards fulfilment of the goal of the universality of this Organization.156.	Yet another African State has shaken off the shackles of colonialism and emerged as a sovereign  independent State. I refer to the Republic of Djibouti  whose delegation is among us for the first time. We congratulate it on its admission to the United Nations and extend to it the hand of friendship. The birth of a new State like the Republic ofDjibouti certainly demonstrates that colonialism is being progressively eliminated and it marks another milestone in the discharge of the historic tasks of our Organization. It reminds us not only of the vast field we have traversed in this area but also of the persistent need to march forward.157.	A classic case in point is the upheavals involved in the current situation in southern Africa. The policies and practices stubbornly pursued there by the minority racist regimes in open defiance of United Nations authority continue to exacerbate the world situation.158.	The situation in Namibia and Zimbabwe is in a critical phase and is dangerously fraught with the risk of civil war and outside intervention. Both Territories are being subjected to an ""internal solution"" by the illegal racist minority regimes in occupation. This is in complete disregard of all positive initiatives taken by the Security Council and the General Assembly to enable the people concerned to achieve genuine national independence.159.	In Namibia the racist minority regime of South Africa continues to consolidate its illegal occupation of the Territory. It has embarked on a policy of imposing its own constitutional formula for Namibia that would fragment the country into several States with subservient regimes. In this manner  the South West Africa People's Organization  a liberation movement internationally acknowledged as the representative of the people of Namibia  is being excluded as a partner in any effort to settle the problem of Namibia. Furthermore  that regime has escalated its military build-up in the Territory. All this has brought the situation in Namibia to a crisis.160.	The delegation of Bur via reaffirms its support for the inalienable right of the people of Namibia to self- determination and independence. We consider that the United Nations commitment to carry out the decolonization of Namibia and to ensure the handing over of power to the people of Namibia in a united Namibia should be scrupulously honoured.161.	The explosive situation in Zimbabwe is another area endangering peace and security in the region.162.	Considerable diplomatic efforts have been invested  both within and outside the United Nations  for effecting a negotiated transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe. The policy of the so-called internal settlement pursued by the illegal racist minority regime has frustrated all positive endeavours 'in this direction. If that regime were not stopped from implementing its plans in Zimbabwe  an escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous consequences would become inevitable.163.	In this situation  the delegation of Burma would hope that the present United Nations decision to help with the necessary arrangements to effect the transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe will prove fruitful. We further express the hope that it will be possible for all parties concerned to co-operate in finding a solution which would reflect the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe for transition to majority rule and national independence. As we see it  the struggle over Zimbabwe has reached a stage in which there is less and less scope for manoeuvring and for delaying a solution.164.	The delegation of Burma is unequivocal on the question of southern Africa. Burma is committed to the struggle for freedom  equality and human dignity  which has swept over Asia and Africa. It firmly believes that the evil system of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination and oppression must be finally eliminated in the interests of peace and friendly relations among nations.165.	The critical Middle East situation remains a perplexing issue. International peace-making efforts in the current year have not brought the Middle East problem any nearer a solution  though they did at times seem to be moving forward to enter a period of active negotiations for a peaceful settlement.166.	The burden of prolonged confrontation in the Middle East and its political and economic consequences is beginning to tell on all parties concerned. These are pressures compounding the dilemma of peace or war. Unless serious negotiations get under way  we are in agreement with the Secretary-General that:.. The situation would almost certainly deteriorate  with incalculable consequences not only for the Middle East but for the international community as a whole"". 167.	In the search for a just solution to the problem  much stress has been laid on the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from Arab territories occupied in 1967; on the recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a State; and on an end to the state of belligerency. These are indeed important prerequisites to a negotiated settlement in the Middle East.168.	As we see it  the key to a Middle East solution is still the Palestine issue. It is now generally agreed that the Palestinians are a national entity entitled to their own State in Palestine. Without saying that the Palestinians should accordingly be represented with all other parties in any negotiations for a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East.169.	The prospects for reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East appear to have moved closer than before. This is a trend which we welcome. At this point  the delegation of Burma must express its deep regret over the recent Israeli establishment of new permanent settlements on the West Bank. Such action can only be deplored as an obstacle to international peace-making efforts and as compounding further the complexities of the Middle East problem.170.	I now turn to the pressing problem of disarmament. This has been a matter of prior concern since the inception of the United Nations. It is a paradox of our times that  while the world talks of disarmament  the science of war has progressed enormously in terms of the range and destructive power of weapons  both nuclear and conventional. Disarmament negotiations have been deadlocked for years and the arms race continues unabated  thrusting to ever new heights. The agreements reached thus far are largely measures of control and limitations of armaments in environments where weapons do not as yet exist  such as outer space  the moon  the sea-bed and ocean floor  and so on. In other words  these agreements do not constitute actual disarmament measures and have not acted to stop the escalating arms race.171.	The Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has been meeting yearly since 1962. Outside its framework are the bilateral Strategic Arms Limitation Talks conducted between the major nuclear Powers since 1969. No less significant are the East-West talks in Central Europe held since 1973  on reducing armed forces and armaments. The United Nations designated the 1970s as the Disarmament Decade  which is now well past its half-way mark. There have been no tangible results in the field of disarmament measures basically because of a lack of political will on the part of the principals of the arms race. This situation reveals a serious- crisis in the current negotiations on disarmament and arms control.172.	In particular  the disarmament scene today is heavily overshadowed by new and ominous developments in the nuclear arms race. Currently  the thrusts and responses of new advances in weapons technology  of shifts in the orientation of strategic doctrines  and of the political-level decisions taken in their wake are threatening to set off yet another frenzied and dangerous nuclear arms race between the world's most powerful nuclear-weapon States.173.	It has long been recognized that nuclear weapons and their carriers lie at the heart of the disarmament problem. Given the magnitude and gravity of the present state of the nuclear arms race  the delegation of Burma strongly feels that the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on Disarmament should address this key area as the matter of first priority. Nuclear disarmament can pave the way to arms control and disarmament measures in the other fields. To tamper with the established programme of priorities between nuclear and non-nuclear measures will do a grievous disservice to the cause of general and complete disarmament and of world peace and security.174.	The delegation of Burma is glad to note what appears to be hopeful signs of movement in two important areas of arms control. We refer to the trilateral talks on the prohibition of underground nuclear weapon tests and the bilateral talks on the banning and elimination of chemical weapons.175.	In this connexion we welcome the assurance that the results of the negotiations will be laid before the appropriate international forums. This would enable positive improvements to be made through democratic discussions and the broadest possible multilateral dialogue and consensus. Only thus can the over-all responsibility of the United Nations in the disarmament sphere be upheld and agreements responsive to the interests of the international community as a whole be achieved.176.	World economic trends over the past year continue to reflect the prevailing crisis of recession. What is worrisome is that no solution has yet been found to alleviate the problems of economic growth  unemployment  monetary difficulties  hunger  poverty  and so on. These ills afflict all countries in some form or the other and to a greater or lesser degree.177.	No single country has been spared the economic shocks of crisis in the domains of energy  raw materials  food  industrialization and technology.178.	The latent instability and prolonged crisis in the world economy more than ever points to the fact that the present international economic system no longer conforms to the demands of the times. A restructuring of the world economy has become imperative to resolve the inequalities and imbalance in international economic relations by the establishment of the new international economic order.179.	The past year witnessed an intense debate at the Paris Conference to resolve some of the main problems in international economic relationships. Despite concerted efforts  the achievements did not go much beyond clarifying problems and enhancing our understanding of the basic issues. We feel that no substantive gains were made towards the establishment of the new international economic order.180.	Under these circumstances  negotiations must necessarily be resumed. We endorse the view that the United Nations system is the most appropriate and fully representative forum for these negotiations. We also believe that is general consensus on this. Such a process should  incur opinion  begin with the current session of the General Assembly.181.	There is much that can be done within the United Nations system on the question of international economic co-operation. But a successful outcome will depend on our efforts to strengthen the United Nations and make it a more effective instrument for such action. Hence we support the current endeavour to restructure the Organization  to increase its efficiency and to enhance its role.182.	The discussions of the past year have identified many key issues in the current economic scene. Some are structural in nature and here changes can only come with time. But others  such as the rapid deterioration in the balance of payments of many developing countries  are more pressing and require urgent attention. We hope that our continuing dialogue on these important issues will take place in a spirit of co-operation and mutual benefit and that we shall be able to find just and concrete solutions to these complex problems.183.	Before I conclude  let me turn briefly to a fundamental difficulty of our Organization.184.	It is a matter for satisfaction that steady progress is being made towards the universality of the membership of the United Nations. It is clear  however  that universality of membership alone is not sufficient to bring about the kind of international order  the kind of world community  envisaged in the Charter. As is clearly indicated in the Charter itself  such a world community will emerge only if Member States steadfastly pursue the purposes of the United Nations and act in accordance with its principles in pursuit of these purposes.185.	It is a fact that every State  when it joins the United Nations  cannot help but bring with it its own national interest and it expects that it will be satisfied  or at least not be infringed upon  by membership in the UnitedNations. In practice  however  it is often not possible to avoid some serious conflict or incompatibility between national interest  on the one hand  and the wider international interests pursued by the United Nations  on the other.186.	Obviously  a new international order  a more just  fair and equitable system of relations among States  will emerge only to the extent that States Members of the United Nations harmonize their national interests with the long-term interests and purposes of the emergent international community as envisaged in the Charter. It is therefore apparent that Member States should address themselves more consciously to such practical measures so as to translate the ideals of the United Nations into reality. "
"85",4752,"MNG",32,1977,"﻿85.	Comrade President  1 have already had the honour of congratulating you upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and to wish you every possible success from the bottom of our hearts. We have also had the honour of congratulating the two new Members  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  upon their admission to membership in the United Nations.86.	I shall begin my statement today  therefore  by simply setting forth the policy of our Government on the most important international problems.87.	In assessing the world situation  the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the premise that the steady change in the correlation of forces in the international arena in favour of peace  national independence and the social progress of peoples  is the prevailing tendency in the world today. This irreversible historical process was started by the Great October Socialist Revolution  whose sixtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year by all of progressive mankind.88.	The emergence of the first socialist State  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  engendered a new type of relations based upon the principles of equality  respect for the independence and sovereignty of all countries  big and small  and of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems.89.	The victory over fascism and militarism with the decisive contribution of the Soviet Union and the formation and consolidation of the world socialist community have enhanced further the possibility of ensuring universal peace and developing equitable international co-operation. It is therefore no accident that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are participating actively in the work of the United Nations  which has set itself the task of maintaining peace and international co-operation.90.	Positive developments in the restructuring of the entire system of international relations on the basis of just and democratic principles have been the result  above all  of the joint efforts of the socialist countries supported by all peace-loving and progressive forces of the world. The successful realization of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems has made detente the prevailing trend in contemporary international life.91.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the principal task of both the world community and the United Nations is to consolidate that trend so as to make it a durable and irreversible process and to extend it to all parts of the world. This task has now become of particular urgency in the face of the attempts undertaken by imperialist and other reactionary forces to frustrate international detente and to return the world to the time of the  cold war   to whip up war hysteria. Such actions are expressed primarily in the escalation of the arms race in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  in the United States of America in the first place  under the false pretext of the so-called  Soviet threat   as well as in the production of new types of weapons of mass destruction such as neutron bombs and Cruise missiles. Proponents of the military-industrial complex are trying to buttress those actions by various concepts such as the concept of  peace through strength   which is meant in fact to justify the unrestrained arms race. These dangerous concepts  which remind one of the military doctrines of the time of the cold war  must give way to ideas conducive to the strengthening of mutual confidence among States.92.	The countries of the socialist community have put forward constructive initiatives aimed at deepening and extending the process of detente by enhancing it through concrete measures in the field of disarmament and the development of international economic  scientific  technical and cultural co-operation on the basis of equal rights and mutual benefit.93.	This consistent course pursued by the socialist countries is explicitly confirmed by the new initiative of the Soviet Union  which focuses the attention of the world public and the United Nations on the vital problems of deepening further the process of international detente and saving humanity from the threat of a thermonuclear war. The proposal to consider the item  deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war   submitted to this session by A. A. Gromyko  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the SovietUnion  is in full conformity with the demand of the peoples of the world that effective measures be taken to stop the arms race and to bring about genuine disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament.94.	With regard to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament  the twin task of strengthening the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests has assumed particular urgency. These measures would make it possible to put an end to the qualitative improvement of those weapons of mass destruction  to prevent the emergence of new types of such weapons. My delegation places its hopes on the negotiations for a complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  which have begun this year between the Soviet Union  the United States and the United Kingdom  and holds the view that constructive steps in this direction would have a far- reaching positive impact. In this connexion  we should like to emphasize the great importance of the new and constructive step taken by the Soviet Union  namely  its willingness to suspend  in agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom  underground nuclear-weapon tests for a certain period of time  even before other nuclear Powers accede to the proposed treaty. This constitutes further proof of the Soviet Union's sincere desire to contribute in every way possible to the cause of nuclear disarmament.95.	Such collateral measures as the strengthening of the IAEA safeguards with respect to transfer of nuclear materials and technology  the creation of zones genuinely free of nuclear weapons  and the complete demilitarization of the sea-bed and the ocean floor are also of great importance for the strengthening of the regime of non- proliferation of nuclear weapons and  consequently for the lessening of the risk of nuclear war.96.	The conclusion of an agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons would exert a favourable influence on all disarmament negotiations being held in different forums and would contribute substantially to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to bringing about nuclear disarmament. The identical statements made by the Soviet Union and the United States regarding their willingness to continue to observe their commitments under the 1972 interim agreement 3 as well as the reports on certain progress recently achieved in bringing closer together the positions of the two Powers  have encouraged us to believe that in the near future agreements may be reached in this vital area.97.	The Mongolian People's Republic holds the view that the concrete agreements achieved in the negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe would represent a tangible measure in easing the situation in the region of the confrontation of the largest military forces.98.	In the light of measures taken by NATO countries in building up armaments  the need to achieve an agreement on these questions on the basis of the principle3 Interim Agreement on certain measures with respect to the limitation of strategic offensive arms  and protocol thereto  signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972 of ensuring equal security for all parties has become of even greater urgency 99.	My delegation wishes to express the hope that the spirit of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  which plays an important role in strengthening detente in Europe  will have a positive impact on the progress of negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in that region which saw the beginning of two devastating world wars.100.	The Mongolian People's Republic was one of the sponsors of the working papers entitled  Basic provisions of the declaration on disarmament  and  Basic provisions of the programme of action on disarmament  submitted by the socialist countries to the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament. In these documents  which epitomize the main ideas of the Soviet memorandum on questions of ending the arms race and disarmament  in addition to the measures of nuclear disarmament  paramount importance is attached to the problems of the prohibition of chemical weapons and of the development and production of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. My delegation considers it necessary that certain results be achieved in the negotiations on these problems well before the special session of the General Assembly  which is to be held in May-June 1978.101.	The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques   signed last summer  is an important supplement to the measures already taken towards curbing the arms race. It is now essential to ensure its universality. In the opinion of my delegation this convention  being a first step in the efforts to prohibit the emergence of new means of mass destruction  could provide a stimulus to further negotiations in this field.102.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic is of the opinion that the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations would be of great significance for the enhancement of the effectiveness of agreements already concluded on curbing the arms race and for creating a favourable atmosphere for making further progress in the disarmament talks.103.	The proposal made by the Soviet Union regarding the conclusion of such an instrument is designed to institutionalise in international relations the principle of the non-use of force  which has already been confirmed in many bilateral and multilateral treaties and also in the Final Act adopted by the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.104.	The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic submits that this session of the General Assembly should indicate concrete measures leading to the elaboration of such a world treaty.105.	The proposal of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty that all participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other will undoubtedly strengthen the atmosphere of confidence among States.106.	The need for strengthening the results achieved in curbing the arms race and producing further measures aimed at achieving the objectives of general and complete disarmament requires the active participation of all States  big and small  nuclear and non-nuclear. The proposal for the convening of a world Disarmament Conference  inter alia  takes account of such a requirement. The progress of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament gives us  in our opinion  grounds for saying that such world forums will be capable of generating momentum for the struggle of the world community for disarmament and of outlining practical ways of achieving progress towards this end.107.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches paramount importance to strengthening peace and security in Asia. For the last three decades this vast continent  where more than one half of the world's population lives  has continuously experienced wars and armed conflicts  provoked by neo-colonialist forces  and there still exist hotbeds of tension  fraught with danger to world peace.108.	The ensuring of lasting peace and security in Asia has assumed particular urgency in the light of the fact that virtually all the States of the region  with few exceptions  are developing countries faced with a great number of urgent problems of socio-economic development.109.	It is therefore natural that the peoples of Asia should be interested in ensuring durable peace throughout Asia.110.	It goes without saying that the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems  as well as principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter and in the Declaration of the Asian-African Conference  held at Bandung in 1955  should serve as a basis for ensuring peace and security in Asia.111.	The Mongolian People's Republic is of the view that  under circumstances of the steady consolidation of the forces of peace  national independence and social progress of peoples  and the further deepening of international detente  it is quite feasible to ensure peace in Asia through the collective efforts of all States of the continent.112.	In setting forth the position of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic on ways of creating an Asia-wide system of peace and security  Comrade Yumjagiyn Tsedenbal  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic  said: The elimination of existing hotbeds of tension  thepolitical settlement of outstanding international disputes the permanent renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the development of mutually beneficial co-operation among the States of the continent serve as a basis for ensuring peace and security in Asia  113.	It is essential  in the first place  to eliminate hotbeds of tension and military conflicts if the foundations of lasting peace in Asia and throughout the world are to be built.114.	The further aggravation of the explosive situation in the Middle East by the aggressive and annexationist actions of the ruling circles of Israel is causing increasingly widespread concern. It is imperative speedily to achieve a lasting and just settlement of that crisis on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  and to secure the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination  including their right to establish their own State  and to guarantee the independent existence of all States of the region.115.	In the light of prevailing circumstances  the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East represents the only means capable of paving the way for a comprehensive solution to the problem.116.	We consider that the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization  recognized by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity as the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine  should be given an opportunity to participate in that Conference from the very beginning on an equal footing with others.117.	The Mongolian People's Republic  which has consistently supported the struggle of the Arab peoples against the Israeli aggressors  is convinced that the Arab countries will further consolidate their unity of action and that their just cause will ultimately be crowned with success.118.	The presence of foreign troops in the south of Korea and the provocative actions of the South Korean regime  which impede the peaceful reunification of the country  are continuing seriously to complicate the situation in the Far East.119.	The initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with regard to a peaceful and democratic solution of the Korean problem without any outside interference command broad international support.120.	This can be said with respect to the proposal made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the convening of a political consultative meeting of the North and the South to be attended by representatives of political parties  public organizations and broad strata of people from both sides of the country.121.	The withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea  dissolution of the so-called  United Nations Command   and replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement  as provided for in the relevant resolution of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly  are pre-conditions for a peaceful settlement of the Korean problem.122.	We are convinced that the struggle of the Korean people for the creation of a unified  independent  democratic State will be crowned with victory and that this hotbed of tension in the Far East  fraught with potential danger to international peace  will be eliminated.123.	It is a matter of profound regret that the situation in Cyprus has so far shown no notable progress. The Mongolian People's Republic favours the solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of complete respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. It is essential to put an end to all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus so that its ethnic communities can themselves solve the problem of the future of their country. We deem it useful that the United Nations and its Secretary General should further promote in every way the success of the intercommunal talks  in conformity with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.124.	There can be no doubt that one of the most important tasks today is the elimination of the remaining strongholds of colonialism and the eradication of racism and apartheid.125.	It is a well-known fact that the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  with extensive support from their Western patrons  are not only persisting in carrying out an inhuman racist policy towards the indigenous peoples  but are consistently committing acts of aggression against neighbouring States  thus creating a threat to peace and security on the African continent. This situation has been further aggravated by the attempts of the South African racists to acquire nuclear weapons. Such a situation in southern Africa calls for the international community to exert further efforts for the speedy and full implementation of all United Nations resolutions for the complete elimination of colonialism and racism—primarily  the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.126.	It is imperative for the United Nations and world public opinion to increase their all-round assistance to the fighting peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  and further urge certain Western Powers to desist from all collaboration with the racist regimes. The Mongolian People's Republic stands for the full and unconditional transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe  the immediate granting of independence to Namibia and the cessation of the policy of racism and apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.127.	It is high time to take effective measures against the racist regimes  as provided for in the United Nations Charter and in Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  as well as in the decisions of a number of representative international forums held under the aegis of the United Nations.13 L As to the so-called peaceful settlement of the problem of southern Africa  the policy of supporting the Salisbury and Pretoria regimes pursued by the authors of those plans should not be overlooked. I should like to emphasize further that in southern Africa we are dealing primarily with a national liberation movement of peoples  and no harm should be done to that movement under any pretext whatsoever.132.	It is evident that the joint action of the peoples of southern Africa and their close alliance with all progressive forces in the world constitute an important factor which will expedite the triumph of their just cause.133.	The Mongolian People's Republic supports the struggle of the developing countries for the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.  What is at issue here is the restructuring of the international economic relations which emerged in conditions of capitalist domination and were based on the exploitation of colonial and dependent countries.134.	The socialist countries are successfully developing relations based on the principles of equality and equal rights  reciprocal benefits and mutual assistance. We submit that essentially the creation of a new international economic order means the reorganization of world-wide economic relations on precisely the same principles.135.	It is natural  therefore  that the developing countries  which are aiming at establishing a new international economic order  should enjoy the support of the socialist countries.136.	The absence of any tangible progress in solving this problem indicates that the major obstacle to the radical restructuring of international economic relations lies in the persistent refusal of the industrially developed capitalist States to meet the just demands of the developing countries. This was demonstrated particularly in the results of the this Conference on so-called  international economic co-operation  as well as in the deliberations of the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly.137.	In their attempts to poison the international atmosphere and sow the seeds of distrust and enmity among nations the champions of the  cold war  have recently launched a slanderous campaign against the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries on the pretext of the so-called  protection  of human rights.138.	However  attempts to deny the achievements of the socialist countries in guaranteeing human rights and freedoms are doomed to total failure because they are refuted by the very facts of life.139.	The new socialist world  born 60 years ago  has eliminated for the first time in the history of mankind the exploitation of man by man and has fully ensured all democratic rights and freedoms. By developing and improving socialist democracy the socialist countries are creating all the necessary conditions for the harmonious development of every individual and for the equal participation of their citizens in the political  economic and spiritual life of society.140.	Many of the fundamental United Nations documents on human rights have been produced with the active participation of the Soviet Union arid other socialist countries.141.	By contrast  the country that is whipping up this noisy and hypocritical campaign has not so far ratified basic documents in this field.142.	The policies and practices of colonialism  racism  violence and aggression result  as experience has shown  in the most flagrant mass violations of human rights. The real cause of violations of human rights is to be found in this.143.	The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the criminal acts of the Chilean junta and demands that an end be put to the bloody repression and persecution of Chilean patriots and democrats.144.	In the conditions of the continuing process of detente the United Nations has an important role to play in co-ordinating the efforts of its Member States for the further consolidation of peace  security and international co-operation.145.	In this connexion I should like to stress here that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic highly appreciates the efforts of our distinguished Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  designed to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations in solving the urgent problems facing the international community.146.	My delegation is convinced that strict observance by Member States of the Charter of the United Nations  which objectively reflects the reality of our time  is the most cogent and appropriate way of further improving the efficiency of the Organization.147.	My delegation therefore opposes any attempt to revise the basic provisions of the Charter  which have stood the test of time and have vital importance for the existence of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and international co-operation.148.	In conclusion  I should like to assure you  comrade President  and the distinguished representatives of Member States  that the Mongolian People's Republic is resolved and will continue to do its utmost to promote the realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations  to deepen international detente and to strengthen peace and international security.

"86",4794,"MOZ",32,1977,"﻿1.	In addressing this Assembly for the first time I should like to acknowledge the honour that this represents for our people. This Assembly embodies the just and profound yearnings of the peoples of the world gathered in the United Nations and is a valuable instrument for surmounting the ills that still affect humanity. In its short but intense history our Organization has already made many contributions towards the solution of problems deriving from situations of injustice and oppression  and from threats to peace and international security.2.	Mr. President  on behalf of the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Mozambican people  we wish to congratulate you on your election as President of this Assembly and for the way in which you are presiding over the work of this Assembly. Your work for the success of this session is also a valuable contribution to the United Nations that we all wish to see strengthened. Allow me  Mr. President  to recall here the relations of solidarity that have united the peoples of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of Mozambique since the time of cur national liberation struggle.3.	We wish to express our appreciation of your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  and congratulate him for the successes achieved by the UnitedNations during his mandate. The way he conducted the work of the thirty-first session of the Assembly is in the fine tradition of leaders of the Republic of Sri Lanka  a country with which we are associated within the non- aligned movement.4.	We welcome with great pleasure the admission to the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The historic contribution of the Vietnamese people to the struggle against colonialism and for the liberation of their homeland  and the successive defeats they inflicted on the world's most powerful armies  brought added hope to dominated peoples and opened new perspectives for their struggle. The history of Viet Nam is  therefore  the patrimony of all nations which have freed themselves from the colonial yoke and foreign occupation and which today constitute the vast majority of this Assembly. The place that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam occupies by right in the United Nations was won by the courage and countless sacrifices of its people in a struggle against continuous aggression over several decades.5.	With the experience it brings and with its exemplary determination to struggle against injustice and for the dignity of the human being  Viet Nam's presence in the United Nations will certainly enrich the work of the Organization and its actions in favour of freedom  peace and progress for all peoples. The decision to admit the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam represents another victory for the Vietnamese people and for mankind as a whole  and gives meaningful substance to the lofty objectives of this Organization.6.	We also rejoice  at the admission to the United Nations of yet another African State  the Republic of Djibouti. The independence of Djibouti is the fruit of the courageous determination of its people in its struggle against French colonialism. The role played by the Organization of African Unity should  however  be emphasized  particularly in the final stage of the delicate process of decolonization. Yet another African people has liberated itself from colonial domination and  in joining the community of independent countries  is beginning to build its future in freedom and sovereignty.7.	The universal dimension that the United Nations acquired by bringing together almost all the independent countries of the world has enabled it to fulfil the deepest aspirations of all peoples for progress  peace and the construction of increasingly just and equitable international relations  and for the affirmation of the rights and dignity of man. Only that dimension will enable States to participate actively in the solution of problems affecting peace and coexistence among nations  and will reinforce the conditions required for the United Nations to achieve the principles and objectives explicitly stated in its Charter.8.	Through its committees and specialized agencies  the United Nations carries out effective and vigorous actions in the struggle against oppression  humiliation and exploitation  thus contributing to the progress of peoples and to the strengthening of peaceful co-operation among nations.9.	We support the intensification of such actions  which represent a valuable contribution to the elimination of many of the causes of contemporary conflicts.10.	The international community has an extremely important role to play in isolating the regimes that persist in oppressing peoples and in practising inhuman policies whose characteristics in some cases have profoundly degrading aspects.11.	We know how difficult the realization of these principles and objectives has been. The causes of conflicts between men still remain. Social injustice  oppression  humiliation and exploitation continue to exist and  in many cases  give rise  as the only possible solution  to the violent revolt of the oppressed in defence of their legitimate rights.12.	At other times we see ourselves faced with conflicts provoked and generated by imperialist ambition and the domination of a people  a country or even an entire region.13.	The rebellion of the colonized peoples against the oppressor regimes and their just struggle for independence have found growing understanding and support within the United Nations.14.	The presence of many States in this Assembly today bears concrete witness to the contribution of the United Nations towards the fulfilment of the deepest aspirations of the peoples of the world.15.	The historic resolution 1514 (XV) adopted by the General Assembly on 14 December 1960  recognizing the right to self-determination and independence of peoples under colonial domination  marked a big and important step forward in the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations and was the fruit of the assumption by the international community of its responsibilities.16.	The history of the liberation struggles of our country is eloquent proof of this. The actions of the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly  the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the Commission on Human Rights  the Security Council and other organs and specialized agencies brought international recognition to our struggle and denunciation of the massacres and crimes perpetrated by the Portuguese colonialists in Mozambique. Consequently  in 1972  the Frente de Libertagao de Mogambique  the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola and the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde received observer status at the United Nations. The United Nations also gave aid of inestimable value to our people in the field of humanitarian assistance  particularly in literacy programmes and medical care and in the reconstruction of the areas liberated from the colonial administration.17.	It is with gratitude that we salute and express our appreciation to the African and socialist countries  the movement of the non-aligned countries and the democratic countries and forces throughout the world who supported us in the difficult moments when our very existence as a people was being denied.18.	The victory of the Mozambican peoples  achieved on 25 June 1975 with the proclamation of the People's Republic of Mozambique  was also a victory for the international community and the result of the firm action of the United Nations.19.	We wish to salute the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  on his re-election. He was with us in the decisive moments of our diplomatic struggle against Portuguese colonialism  defending the justice of our people's aspirations.20.	After the decision of the People's Republic of Mozambique to apply fully the sanctions decreed by this Organization against the illegal minority Rhodesian regime and during the aggression of which our country is a victim  the Secretary-General has faithfully interpreted the full meaning of international solidarity with our Government and our people.21.	Our victory asserts itself today in the coming to fruition of the fundamental objectives for which our people agreed to make so many sacrifices—the creation of a popular democratic State.22.	On 25 September last all Mozambican citizens began the process of the effective exercise of people's democracy by electing people's assemblies at the local level  in population centers at the base  and at the national level. We are building a new type of State on the ruins of the colonial State. Power belongs to  and is exercised by  the broad masses through the people's assemblies.23.	This is an unprecedented event in our history and was made possible only by our people's victory over Portuguese colonialism and the revolutionary gains won since the proclamation of independence.24.	In this way the Mozambican people are constructing their history  building democracy  consolidating the victories they have already achieved and determining their future in ""freedom and sovereignty. Allow us to associate the action of the United Nations with this event of such high significance for the Mozambican people.25.	The present international juncture is eminently favourable to the people's struggle for independence and peace as a result of the successes of national liberation struggles  the consolidation of the socialist camp and the successes of the workers' democratic movements in the capitalist countries. From this point of view the outstanding victories of the peoples of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Democratic' Kampuchea are a stimulus and a permanent encouragement to all those who struggle for freedom  independence and peace. They prove that imperialism can be defeated on the battlefield.26.	The liquidation of the oldest and most retrograde colonial empire through the combined efforts of the peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Guinea-Bissau  Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe  and the creation in these countries of sovereign States dedicated to the total liberation of the continent  have profoundly transformed the balance of power in Africa  particularly in southern Africa.27.	All these factors extend the liberated zone of humanity and create a situation favourable to the full liberation of all peoples from oppression and exploitation. In increasing numbers and with an increasing awareness  the broad masses throughout the world are rising against tyrants  against the exploiting classes  and against monopolies that enslave men  pillage nations and oppress continents.28.	We shall now touch upon the problem that is of particular concern to the peoples in our area but which is at the same time a source of concern for the international community as a whole  namely  the existence of oppressive and discriminatory regimes in southern Africa and the threat of confrontation that they represent.29.	The geographic situation and the economic resources of the countries in the area turned them into the object of the greed of the colonial countries which  taking advantage of favourable conditions for the implantation of settlements  established in those countries large colonies of immigrants who exploited the wealth of the subsoil and the soil and the labour of the peoples in the region.30.	Thus was born the whole complex of white domination in southern Africa which until very recently comprised South Africa  Rhodesia  Namibia  Angola and Mozambique. The highly favourable conditions prevailing in southern Africa as compared with other areas of the world  in particular its mineral and agricultural wealth  led to the settlement of millions of whites in this part of Africa. With the exception of Algeria—and even there to a much smaller extent—no such phenomenon occurred in any other part of our continent. However  we find something rather special in the situation prevailing in southern Africa: it is not the size of the numbers involved but rather the creation of a system of exploitation which has already been set aside by capitalism in the rest of the world  a system characterized by pillage and by the denial to the population of its most elementary human rights.31.	With different procedures and institutional forms  that was the situation prevailing throughout southern Africa. The patterns of exploitation implanted in southern Africa varied  however  depending on local conditions and the level of development in the colonial countries.32.	Apartheid  the most extreme and degrading form of domination imposed by force by a Nazi-type regime  reduced black South Africans to the condition of mere instruments of production. This inhuman form of subjection  placed at the service of an aggressive capitalist regime  led to the creation of a bastion of white power in southern Africa. Using an essentially similar system  and with South African support  the settlers of southern Rhodesia  in their unilateral proclamation of independence  sought to extend the power of this racist bastion northwards. Namibia  placed under the Mandate of the Union of South Africa in the days of the League of Nations  was later appropriated by South Africa and integrated into its sphere of economic domination.33.	Portuguese colonialism  equally dedicated to plunder and to the exploitation of the peoples and wealth of its colonies  could not  however  achieve the same degree of economic and military consolidation owing to the limitations of the colonial State  itself economically underdeveloped. That was the weak link in the chain. On the other side of the barrier are the African peoples-peoples who were refused the status of men among men and lived as peoples without land in their own country  as foreigners in their own homeland  suffering a long history of subjection to massacres over generations.34.	This is the scenario in which the great confrontations are taking shape  a scenario which now includes even the nuclear threat. The heavy responsibility for preventing the consummation of such threats and for finding the road to peace devolves on all of us  and especially on the United Nations. That road can only be that of just solutions: not a peace that is reached by silencing the shots of rebellion of the oppressed or by gagging the voice of the peoples but the kind of peace that is affirmed by asserting the right of peoples.35.	We evoke this situation in the framework of new responsibilities and of the consequences of our indifference  of our lack of decision  of the commitment of those whose monopolies enriched themselves at the cost of human suffering. It is therefore among ourselves that we must try to find the answer to the questions which are put to us. How is it possible that a system which is diametrically opposed to the deepest convictions shared by all humanity has been allowed to survive until our times? How is it that a regime like that of Ian Smith   condemned since its birth and cast aside by the international community  can survive 12 long years despite the condemnation of the international community? How is it that in this interdependent world of ours it can survive  growing stronger year by year in the face of compulsory sanctions ordered by the United Nations? The survival of the Ian Smith regime has been possible only with the direct support of the Portuguese colonial-Fascist regime and South Africa and the camouflaged support of some Western countries through their companies and their nationals.36.	In the light of the present situation  we must assume our responsibilities; we do not want to substitute ourselves for the people of Zimbabwe in their liberation struggle but to support them firmly and resolutely. To assume our responsibilities is to isolate and eliminate the Ian Smith regime now and to guarantee majority rule; to assume our responsibilities is to direct our efforts towards ensuring true independence for Zimbabwe.37.	It is in this context that the People's Republic of Mozambique views its participation together with that of the United Republic of Tanzania  the Republic of Zambia  the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Botswana in the quest for a solution to that problem. This action is inseparable from the political  material and moral support to be given to the freedom fighters grouped in the Patriotic Front.38.	The recent Anglo-American proposals for a solution to the situation in Zimbabwe present serious limitations. On the one hand  the colonial Power seeks  in the phase of transition to independence  a concentration of power the like of which it never had during the whole colonial period and which does not guarantee the immediate participation of Zimbabweans in the exercise of power. On the other hand  the proposals maintain intact the whole state apparatus of the illegal regime and clearly show excessive concern with the protection of the rights of the settlers.39.	We should like to broach this problem in the light of our experience. If it is a matter of protecting the lives and legitimate interests of citizens from violence  we can understand that concern; if  however  it is a matter of protecting privileges acquired during the colonial era because of skin colour and  consequently  because of colonialist discrimination  such guarantees go beyond the protection due  and any attempt to impose them is in fact interference in the affairs of an independent Zimbabwe. In fact  in the long run that protection would be prejudicial to those it claims to serve.40.	The whites of Zimbabwe  like the whites of Mozambique or of any other country in our zone  can choose to become citizens of the country in which they live  while becoming integrated into its political and social life. The maintenance of discriminatory situations based on race  far from assisting in the creation of an egalitarian society  is prejudicial to the integration of the whites of Zimbabwe into an anti-racist Zimbabwean society and does nothing but aggravate social tensions and create conditions which could lead to racial confrontation. This has been borne out by recent history.41.	We demand the dismantling of the rebel army with its mercenaries and puppets  its shock troops of racism  which is the instrument of permanent aggression against independent Africa. The dismantling of this army is a necessary condition for guaranteeing peace and stability in independent Zimbabwe. This is the army which destroyed Mapai; this is the army which murdered in cold blood 800 defenceless refugees at Nyazonia; this is the army which is still today committing continued acts of aggression against the territory of the People's Republic of Mozambique.42.	The criminal army of aggression must disappear; otherwise it will frustrate the best efforts for the establishment of a durable peace in the region.43.	Those who think that they can use puppet troops for the protection of whites in Zimbabwe are mistaken. History shows  and our own experience confirms  that it is these elements who  given their initiation in the school of terrorism by the occupier  turn against their former masters at the end of the occupation and carry out the most barbarous acts against them.44.	Finally  we cannot help but point out the profoundly anti-democratic character of the attempt to impose rigid  immutable clauses which will remain in force for eight years after independence; such clauses constitute  therefore  many grave limitations on the full sovereignty of the people of Zimbabwe.45.	The recognition of the principle of national independence  the determination of the period in which it should occur  and the principle of universal elections contained in the same proposals  will enable us to make progress towards the solution of the problem. In the same way  the United Kingdom's acceptance of responsibility in the process  the acceptance of the principle of basing the future army of Zimbabwe on the liberation forces  and the participation of the international community in the process  also merit emphasis.46.	However  the immediate removal of Ian Smith  the head of the racist  minority Government  is clearly a condition for the success of all efforts. It was Ian Smith who was chiefly responsible for the failure of all attempts at negotiation during the 12 years of his racist rebellion  and the sincerity and effectiveness of the present proposals depend to a large extent on the determination and ability of the United Kingdom and the United States to remove Ian Smith from the political scene forthwith.47.	The Anglo-American proposals contain many negative points and leave many questions unanswered. However  they can provide a basis for negotiation. This was the conclusion arrived at the last meeting of the front-line Heads of State  which took place in Maputo.48.	The People's Republic of Mozambique intends to continue to assume its full share of responsibility in support of the Zimbabwe people.49.	In this context  aware of its internationalist duty of solidarity  the People's Republic of Mozambique will remain firm in its determination to implement fully the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the illegal racist regime of Southern Rhodesia until the liberation of the people of Zimbabwe.50.	In Namibia  the people's struggle is being intensified and has achieved new victories at both the political and the military levels. Incapable of openly opposing the demand for independence  South Africa is seeking above all a way out which safeguards its interests. With this aim in mind  the South African regime multiplies its manoeuvres designed to divide the territory while searching for a sham independence in Namibia.51.	It is in this context that the consultations between the colonial administration and the tribal puppets put forward at the eleventh hour as representatives of the people must be placed. Even stranger is the participation of settlers' parties  which always opposed independence in any talks on the country's future. And it is still in this context that the attempt to separate Walvis Bay  an integral part of Namibia  as a condition of the real independence of Namibia  must be placed.52.	The countries in the region have closely followed the consultations carried out by the five members of the United Nations Security Council. To the extent that those consultations are to be placed within the context of Security Council resolution 385 (1976)  the initiative of those five Powers could contribute to the solution of the conflict. However  we believe that they will be successful only if their objective is the total and complete independence of all of Namibia  if they respect the will of the Namibian people as expressed through the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their only true representative  and if the five Powers do not attempt to substitute themselves for SWAPO in the solution of the problem of Namibia.53.	A solution to the problems of southern Africa implies  above all  elimination of the apartheid regime. The existence of this regime  hostile to humanity  creates intolerable tension and constitutes a threat to the peoples of Africa.54.	South Africa is propping up the Ian Smith regime in flagrant violation of sanctions proclaimed by the United Nations. It invades the People's Republic of Angola  militarizes Namibia  creates  finances and supports groups entrusted with armed subversive operations in the independent African countries.55.	Therefore  to supply weapons or to create conditions enabling South Africa to manufacture them is tantamount to fanning the flames of war and destruction in southern Africa and collaborating in acts of oppression against independent Africa. In this context the introduction of nuclear weapons in our area creates a highly dangerous situation.56.	However  no weapon  no manoeuvre  will be able to stop the liberation of the South African people  who today resist with their bare hands the murderous bullets of the South African forces of repression and the torturers in the prisons where people allegedly commit suicide. Soweto symbolizes the movement of the rebellion of the South African people—a rebellion whose flame will never be quenched and a people whose great cry of rebellion will never be silenced. These voices are arrows which penetrate our conscience and demand our support. All of humanity must make the cause of the southern African people its own.57.	The complete liberation of Africa  the elimination of discrimination and apartheid  shadows of a past which is still projected into the present  are the sacred duty of all the African people and of all the peoples of the world.58.	The People's Republic of Mozambique is aware of its special responsibilities as a Member of the United Nations and as a country geographically adjacent to the last bastions of racism in Africa. The People's Republic of Mozambique will not waver in its fulfilment of that internationalist duty. We will not yield before any intimidation or blackmail. We will not yield before any aggression  no matter how barbarous and cruel it may be. In this struggle we fight with the active support of all countries sensitive to the cause of the liberation of peoples.59.	Here  we should like to hail the decision of the Security Council in its resolution 411 (1977) appealing to all Member States to strengthen the defence capacity of the People's Republic of Mozambique. That act represents valuable encouragement: it is a significant act of solidarity  a great victory for all the oppressed peoples and a victory for the United Nations. This support is all the more important because the Ian Smith regime continues to send its murderous troops against the people and peaceful villages of our country. Provocations  subversion and the infiltration of agents are increasing in preparation for even greater aggression. This means that the destabilization plan hatched by imperialism against our country continues and that its active instruments are the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa.60.	Today more than ever we see the end of colonialism in Africa drawing near. It is true that threatening clouds darken the horizon; but it is within the reach of our determination to overcome the remaining obstacles and finally to implant a true peace based on just relations among men and nations.61.	The People's Republic of Mozambique enshrined in its Constitution the principle of the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a denuclearized zone of peace. We consider that the peoples of that region who suffered so greatly from the evils of colonial and imperialist domination and who today are engaged in the campaign against poverty  ignorance  disease and all the consequences of under-development in a struggle which is a pre-condition to achieving true human dignity and true freedom should be spared the threat of a nuclear war with all its attendant destruction.62.	The peoples of the countries bordering the Indian Ocean share a common heritage of relations and culture that they wish to develop; they have a shared desire for progress and peace and a will to preserve their hard-won independence against any form of domination.63.	Until a short time ago  the Indian Ocean was safe from involvement in the event of nuclear conflicts. For that reason  although we welcome warmly all those who come to the Indian Ocean with peaceful intentions or for the development of fruitful economic relations  we are extremely apprehensive about  and resolutely condemn  the establishment of any military bases of foreign Powers in the zone.64.	In this context  we deem it necessary that the international community and  in particular  the countries of the region should dedicate themselves to studying ways and means of prohibiting the presence of any r reign military bases in the area while guaranteeing the dismantling of those already in existence and enabling the coastal countries to control the presence and movement of foreign military fleets.65.	In the Middle East the situation created by the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to their own homeland has for decades been a factor of tension that has led to increasing violence  wars of aggression  the occupation of the territory of sovereign countries and  above all  to a persistent and systematic violation of human rights. The painful events in Lebanon are a result of that situation.66.	The root of the problem is to be found in the racial basis and expansionist nature of the State of Israel  which obstructs peaceful coexistence among the countries of the region.67.	The nuclear threat aggravates the climate of tension. The collaboration of the new axis of oppression-SouthAfrica/Israel-is aimed at intimidating the African and Arab peoples and deterring them from engaging in a just liberation struggle in the occupied territories and countries. At the same time it aims at blocking the consolidation and economic progress of the independent neighbouring countries.68.	We believe that the stabilization of the Middle East can be achieved only by the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to create their own State and by the withdrawal of all Israeli troops and settlers from the Arab territories occupied in 1967.69.	Anti-Semitic racism  with its aftermath of horror  must be buried once and for all. Those who were its victims are today  in many ways  becoming real agents for the resurrection of analogous and equally reprehensible forms of racism. From that standpoint  we consider the resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to be an imperative need  a conference in which the Palestine Liberation Organization should participate as an equal member.70.	Other situations of confrontation continue to exist across the continents and require the attention of our Organization in the context of support for the struggle of peoples for their liberation. On our continent  the violation of the generally accepted principle of respect for existing boundaries and the greed of the great Powers have led to the invasion  the annexation or the dismemberment of certain countries. Such is the case of the island of Mayotte - an integral part of the Republic of the Comoros-occupied by France. In the north of Africa  the Saharan people are unable to exercise the right to self- determination inasmuch as their territory is occupied.71.	The People's Republic of Mozambique condemns the illegal occupation of Mayotte and Western Sahara  which violates the right of all peoples to self-determination enshrined in the United Nations Charter  and expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the Comorian and Saharan peoples and demands that an end be put to the violation of the integrity of their countries. At the same time  the People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes between African countries.72.	In East Timor  after almost two years of military invasion by Indonesia  the Maubere people are resisting heroically. That occupation was launched  not as an anti-colonial act against Portuguese domination  but after the collapse of colonialism.73.	We firmly support the fight of the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor and call on the Government of Indonesia to withdraw its troops and establish relations of good neighbourliness and co-operation with that country.74.	We firmly support the efforts undertaken with a view to the peaceful reunification of Korea  to which the withdrawal of American troops is linked as a condition to enable the Korean people to resolve their problems without external interference.75.	We support with equal determination the just struggle of the People's Republic of China for the recovery of Taiwan  which is a part of its national territory illegally occupied by imperialism.76.	We welcome the recent agreements on the Panama Canal which constitute a positive and decisive initial step towards putting an end to the old imperialist policy of dismembering countries and dividing peoples.77.	We condemn in particular the terror instituted by the Chilean military regime in violation of all the values held by the community of nations. We condemn the arbitrary arrests  the torture  and the disappearance of prisoners.78.	We are  however  confident that the dark shadow of fascism  which at the moment engulfs various countries of Latin America as a desperate reaction to the conquests of their peoples  will finally be overcome and that democracy will be re-established.79.	We should like to believe that the campaign that has been launched in favour of human rights will represent the beginning of a new phase in the policy of denunciation of Fascist regimes in Latin America  whose inhumanity is notorious in the extreme. May the results of that policy be the withdrawal of support to those puppet regimes.80.	The People's Republic of Mozambique cannot but condemn the continuation of situations of oppression  and demands the fulfilment of the principles of the United Nations Charter.81.	We are convinced that harmonious relations between States are achieved through the recognition of the right of peoples to decide their own destiny  along the paths of their own choice  for the good of all mankind. The peoples of the world want peace.82.	Disarmament is a fundamental necessity if we are to achieve co-operation between States in peace and security. We are greatly concerned at the development of weapons research  and of research into the development of increasingly powerful and inhuman lethal arms capable of the irremediable destruction of life on earth.83.	Consequently  the People's Republic of Mozambique defends the principle 'of general and universal disarmament and of the immediate cessation of the arms race  embracing all types of weapons of mass destruction. In this context  too  the People's Republic of Mozambique congratulates the European peoples for their successes in their policy of European detente  while at the same time expressing its conviction that that process must not be limited to one part of the world alone  but  rather  should be affirmed universally as a constant factor in international relations.84.	We wish to affirm our full support for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations to deal with this question  as an important step towards the holding of a world disarmament conference.85.	In every continent  the peoples under colonial domination have progressively won political independence. The countries thus liberated from the colonial yoke have become support bases for the peoples still struggling for their freedom.86.	However  the consolidation and strengthening of those victories demands that we intensify our fight for economic and social development  and that this in turn requires a constant and rapid increase in the productive capacity of recently liberated nations  this being the only way to solve the basic problems of our peoples.87.	The rapid development of our productive forces and the overcoming of inherited backwardness and dependence necessarily imply technical and economic co-operation with all countries. However  those economic relations and that technical co-operation are not always approached with a view to just mutual benefits  reciprocal respect  and non-interference in internal affairs.88.	Responsibility for the existing situation of imbalance which must be changed  falls in particular on the highly developed countries  whose development process was achieved at the expense of those countries which are today the most backward.89.	The present tensions in the world have been brought on essentially by the economic interests and the unbridled greed of the international monopolies. It is in this context that we understand the differences between countries  the existing situation of injustice in international economic relations and the contradiction where we see some colonial-type relations.90.	In the present-day world the contradiction between developed and developing countries cannot be put on a geographical North-South basis. There exists a profound contradiction between exploitation and the people's interests  a contradiction which opposes the oppressed peoples and the colonial Powers  the working classes and the monopolies  socialism and capitalism.91.	It is this situation of injustice and inequality  surviving from colonialism  which confines the young independent States to the role of mere producers of raw materials and importers of manufactured goods. There is also a tendency on the part of imperialism to transfer to those countries industries having obsolete technology or those which carry out the partial processing of raw materials through the use of cheap and abundant labour. On the other hand  when highly advanced industries happen to be established  this is done in such a way as to create situations of technological dependency. The conquests of science and technology are thus used as weapons of domination.92.	The new international division of labour which imperialism seeks to impose on the world by internationalizing the brutal exploitation of human labour will serve only to sharpen world economic conflicts.93.	It is in this context that we participate in the struggle of the developing countries for the establishment of a new international economic order. This struggle  which is hindered by great obstacles  requires an effective and co-ordinated effort against those economic and political forces which seek at all costs to maintain their relations of exploitation with the developing countries and which use financial institutions which they control for the purpose. This struggle is absolutely necessary if the countries which make up the overwhelming majority of Members of the United Nations are to overcome their economic and technological backwardness and make progress in every sphere of action.94.	The struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order requires concerted action by the international community with a view to transforming the relations of dependency and exploitation into relations of mutually advantageous co-operation based on equality and reciprocity of benefits. It further requires greater technical and economic co-operation among developing countries struggling to create a strong and independent economy  which is the basis for the solution of the countless social problems caused by the domination to which they were subjected in the past.95.	A new international economic order will constitute an important factor in the solution of the problems of developing countries and will undoubtedly facilitate their efforts to overcome their economic under-development. However  the decisive factor for the achievement of victory over the backwardness left behind by colonial domination must be found in the development of productive forces and in profound social changes that will make possible the construction of the material and ideological bases that will help us build a society free from exploitation.96.	At the same time we believe that at present our fight cannot be limited to the struggle for economic independence. That independence and the steps that marked its conquest  particularly the right to dispose of one's own natural wealth and resources  could be emptied of content or even wiped out if these victories are not consolidated through the establishment of new relations in production at the internal level and of a popular regime.97.	Fundamentally  in order to break away from the state of dependency it is necessary to industrialize our countries and consequently to have our peoples control their natural resources while fighting the international monopolies. The creation of a heavy industry capable of producing the necessary equipment and factors of production required by our economies will allow the mechanization of agriculture and make it possible to meet the people's fundamental needs in food. Thus the bases for developing a manufacturing industry will be created and high levels of productivity and true and independent economic development will be achieved.98.	Our conception of development is that the building of a national heavy industry is the decisive factor for our effective liberation from economic dependence.99.	We are firmly convinced that the Manila Declaration is a valid basis for discussion in the United Nations. We hope that  unlike what has happened in the past  in future talks there will be the political willingness necessary to break the deadlock in which we find ourselves.100.	The germs of colonialism have not yet been totally wiped from the face of the earth. While our participation in this Assembly is proof of the success of our struggle against colonialism  nevertheless a great deal still remains to be done. The United Nations must meet the aspirations of the oppressed peoples and minimize the sacrifices to which they must consent in order to conquer the fundamental right to decide their own destiny.101.	Our presence in this Assembly today enables us to reaffirm our deep conviction that only harmonious coexistence between nations will make possible the development and consolidation of correct and fraternal relations among peoples.102.	In greeting the peoples of the world through their representatives in this Assembly we are also expressing certainty that the hope for freedom which lives in all men will be transformed by our action into the reality of justice  well-being and peace so earnestly desired by the peoples of the world.103.	The struggle continues. "
"87",4839,"MRT",32,1977,"﻿1.	 We are gathered together once again to examine  in the light of the events which have occurred since the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  the progress achieved and the problems raised in all fields which are of concern to the international community and which constitute the field of activity of the United Nations. The subject is a vast one and  of course  complex in many respects. But  Mr. President  having elected you unanimously as President of the General Assembly  we are sure that we shall fulfil the great hopes aroused by our work and our deliberations.2.	Mr. President  aware as we are of the experience  the qualities of tact  flexibility and yet of firmness which you possess  and of the distinguished and positive role played by your country  Yugoslavia  in all areas  and the sense of responsibility that country possesses  we cannot but be gratified at the choice made by the thirty-second session of the General Assembly in electing you to conduct our proceedings. Mauritania  which maintains strong and many- faceted links with your country  particularly within the non-aligned movement  would like  through me  to convey to you its congratulations and assure you of its support in your difficult task.3.	Your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka 1 deserves our gratitude and our appreciation also for the remarkably competent and objective way in which he conducted our proceedings at the last session. As for our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  there is no need for me to expatiate on the esteem in which we hold him for his efforts to make our Organization into a genuinely effective instrument for the service of peace  economic and social progress and stability in the world. He can be sure of the support of my country in his difficult but none the less noble and exalting task.	 4.	I cannot come to the substance of my statement without expressing also to the fraternal people of Djibouti and the people of Viet Nam our congratulations on their admission to the United Nations.. The presence of the Republic of Djibouti among us today marks the end of an important chapter in Franco-African history. In putting an end to its presence in Djibouti  France accomplished an important task of decolonization which was without doubt difficult  but which in its conception and its manner of execution redounds to the credit of France and the French people. We are sure that relations between France and Africa  henceforth free of all notions of dependence  will greatly benefit from the work thus completed. Welcoming Viet Nam to our Organization is also a moral comfort and a definite encouragement to all peoples still groaning under the yoke of segregation and colonial domination.5.	I have just said that the subjects we consider here are vast and complex in certain of their aspects. The agenda of 128 items which we adopted well reflects their scope and importance  from both the political and the economic standpoint. It is  of course  most useful and indeed important to review all these points. However  as time is limited I shall devote the bulk of my statement to the situation in southern Africa  to that in the Middle East and also to disarmament and international economic relations.6.	As we form part of both the African and the Arab worlds  and because we belong to the non-aligned movement and the Group of 77  my country is perhaps more sensitive to the important problems I have just mentioned. We feel  none the less—and this is a matter of conviction to us in Mauritania—that the coming of a world of peace  equality and stability  as conceived in the Charter of our Organization  will remain a distant dream until a just and lasting solution is found for these different problems.7.	The situation in southern Africa indeed remains one of the sources of tension  most dangerous for peace in Africa-all Africa-and  beyond Africa  for peace in the world. In this part of our continent we are facing not only classical colonialism but  what is more  a giant machine of repression known as apartheid  usurpation  racism and the pure and simple denial of the most elementary human rights.8.	The black population of South Africa  which represents more than 80 per cent of the whole population of the country  has been entirely stripped of its social  economic and political rights by a handful of South African whites solely because of a difference in colour. Furthermore  is authentic people of South Africa have been corralled into a small proportion of its national territory with hardly 15 per cent of the wealth of its own country. A blind system of repression and unfair legislation has been established by the racist regime in Pretoria to put down all opposition and do away with the slightest attempt at resistance. Sharpeville and Soweto  where workers and hundreds of students protest against the racism of which their people is the victim  are fresh in our memories to remind us of the truly disgusting nature of the South African regime. More recently  the murder of Steven Biko  this wise and respected leader of South Africa  fills us with indignation and bitterness and once again shows that arbitrary detention  persecution and torture are the daily practice of the South African regime. The body of Steven Biko was certainly destroyed by this repressive machinery  but his spirit remains more alive than ever. Permit me to commemorate here the memory of Steven Bike  in the conviction that his sacrifice for freedom and the dignity of his people will do even more to mobilize the whole of Africa and rally it around the ideals which he set himself.9.	The racist and repressive policy of the Pretoria regime is not limited to South Africa; quite the contrary  it has been extended to the international Territory of Namibia and established as a system of government. In spite of the many relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council the Vorster regime has so far not changed its attitude of systematic refusal to free the Territory of Namibia in accordance with the aspirations of the Namibian people.10.	In this regard my country has followed with close interest the actions undertaken by the five Western Powers members of the Security Council. We are certainly pleased at all peaceful efforts to free the Territory of Namibia and  in particular  at this initiative of the five countries. But we should like to reaffirm that any solution which fails to take account of the necessary unity of the country and its people  of the representativeness of the South West Africa People's Organization  will be a solution doomed to failure. Unfortunately  we cannot fail to see that the Vorster regime continues to wish to create an artificial State in Namibia while seeking to pillage part of Namibian territory. The appointment by Vorster of a General Administrator of the Territory  and his claims to Walvis Bay  illustrate the extent to which the champions of apartheid are determined to flout Security Council resolution 385 (1976) and to defy the international community.11.	The Ian Smith regime  too  constitutes a unique case  where a handful of 300 000 white racists have unilaterally declared the independence of a country to which they do not belong  thus creating a situation flagrant not only in its illegitimacy but also in terms of the segregation and the domination of 6 million Africans  the authentic and rightful sons of Rhodesia. The people of Zimbabwe  on the strength of the support naturally accorded by Africa and conferred upon it by the international community  has risen  as indeed all those who wish to live in liberty or die in dignity rise. The stubbornness of the Rhodesian rebels is none the less such that 12 years afterwards the regime of Ian Smith  even though it certainly has its back more and more to the wall  is seeking to create the appearance of legitimacy by having recourse to all kinds of stratagems and  in particular  using certain dissidents of the liberation movements to the detriment of the Patriotic Front. Such a masquerade obviously can only mislead those who are not very well conversant with the true nature of the Rhodesian regime and who are unaware of the determination of the people of Zimbabwe and the active solidarity which it now enjoys among all Members of our Organization.12.	Even those who have been and remain responsible and who for such a long time did not think it necessary to face up to this responsibility are today realizing the danger of the situation and seeking to end the Smith rebellion by trying to bring about majority Government.13.	The Anglo-American plan  which will be put into concrete terms by the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  well illustrates this new tendency and constitutes in itself an undeniable victory of the Rhodesian national forces. Coming several years too late  of course  the Anglo-American plan  as accepted by the Patriotic Front and approved by the African front-line countries  nevertheless does constitute a praiseworthy initiative for which both British and Americans should get credit. We in Mauritania should like to express the hope that we shall see this plan applied in all its parts as soon as possible in order to relieve the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe and to avoid further bloodshed.14.	Apartheid and its tentacles  which we can see in Rhodesia and Namibia  are an inadmissible challenge and insult to the international community at the very time when it is placing in the forefront of its preoccupations respect for human rights  at a time when it is more than ever aspiring to a world of concord  stability and justice. They also constitute a threat to peace in Africa and  beyond Africa  are liable to jeopardize international security. Several times now Zambia  Mozambique and Botswana have been attacked by the forces of Ian Smith and Vorster  thus constituting a threat to the stability of these countries and violating their sovereignty. Mauritania would like to express here its whole-hearted solidarity with fraternal African front-line peoples  whose support for just causes have exposed them at any moment to armed attack and sufferings of all kinds.15.	In this respect we are encouraged by the fact that we in Africa are not the only ones to understand the imminent danger inherent in this explosive situation in southern Africa. The international community has indeed not only shown us that it understands but has also displayed its solidarity in Maputo at the International Conferences in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and in Lagos at the World Conference for Action against Apartheid. The success of those Conferences and the recommendations they adopted prove-if proof be needed-that we are facing an explosive situation in the southern part of our continent.16.	It is not the few peripheral quarrels that  unfortunately  exist here and there between African countries and will  of course  be solved within the framework of the African family  which should be allowed to divert our attention from this central concern which is for us domination and the segregation of our brothers in southern Africa.17.	I have spoken at some length about these problems of southern Africa to which my country is particularly sensitive and which it considers  quite rightly in our view  as being of fundamental interest for the peace of the world. Unfortunately  there exists another problem just as lingering and just as much a matter of concern to my country because it affects it directly. This problem is that of the Middle East.18.	More than 30 years have elapsed since the United Nations  under various kinds of pressure  decided to create on Palestinian soil the Israeli entity  thus reducing the Arab people of Palestine to becoming wanderers and having to rely on international charity. Of course  the United Nations did recommend at that time the establishment of a Palestinian entity on another part of the same territory. That in itself reflects the injustice of such a decision. The Palestinian people was granted part of its own national territory  and another part of it was given to immigrants who for more than 2 000 years have had no ties with Palestine apart from religious ones  such as those of the adherents of any other religion. Gradually Israel  like a cancer  has come to occupy the whole of Palestine  has driven out the inhabitants  destroyed their homes  pillaged their goods and  finally  begun to encroach upon neighbouring Arab territories.19.	Since that time we have seen four wars in the area  each one revealing the implacable nature of the Israeli occupation and the danger that it represents for the whole Arab nation and the peace of the world. At the same time  the Tel Aviv authorities  who owe their existence to the United Nations  have displayed unpardonable insolence with regard to the United Nations and have gone as far as to describe its decisions as  immoral .20.	The various vicissitudes which have marked the development of the problem over the last 30 years are sufficiently familiar to this Organization  as are also  the considerable number of proposals made by Arab States with the aim of finding a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem. But the sophisticated propaganda used by Israel  the complicity and support it has enjoyed in various Western countries  have for a long time camouflaged the facts  transforming the terrorist methods of Israel into actions taken for its salvation and making of the occupation of Arab States a necessity for its survival.21.	Most fortunately  this simplistic plan could not stand up to the pressure of the actual facts which have become clearer every day. The facts are Israel's policy of occupation by force  the planting of colonies in Arab territories  exactions of all kinds and political assassinations. The recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) by the international community and even by the most faithful friends of Israel as an essential element in the problem of the Middle East and the fact that the need has now been accepted for the evacuation of Arab territories make absolutely clear the isolation of Israel and the disapproval of its policy. It is none the less surprising that countries which have long experience of international life and perhaps are better acquainted than anyone else with the true nature of the problem should continue to demand that the PLO recognize the existence of Israel as a preliminary to any negotiations. This approach indeed is tantamount to telling the Palestinians:  Accept your lot and come to negotiations with your hands tied; whileIsrael rejects the participation of the PLO even after this recognition. In so doing they are asking the Palestinian people  which has been driven out of its land and robbed of its possessions  to abandon everything that it still holds as an element of negotiation. In a word  the Palestinian people are being asked to bend to the will of Israel while recognizing its legitimacy without any counterpart.22.	If the PLO were to go beyond the recent extremely moderate and responsible statements of its leaders  it would run the risk of damaging its representativeness and render its presence in the negotiations and its possible commitments without significance. In fact  this is what Israel is aiming at in demanding of the Palestinian people  by proxy  something that would probably lead to the division of the PLO and its weakening  so as later to be able to attribute to it the failure of any attempt at peace in the Middle East.23.	This  in our view  is the error of those—some of whom  of course  are acting in good faith—who are still subjecting the PLO to such demands. Those demands have in any case been rendered obsolete by recent events  particularly because all the Arab States of the area and the Palestinian people now consider peace in the Middle East not only as a duty but as an imperative necessity  with everything that involves by way of mutual recognition. My colleagues and brothers  the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and of Syria  proposed on 28 September and 29 September from this very rostrum a wise and realistic procedure which should lead to a just and lasting peace because it takes into account all the elements of the problem.24.	There is a fresh opportunity for peace offered by the Arab nation  and here we have all the conditions created to allow the Middle East to undertake and embark upon the course of salvation and finally become once again the land of harmony  coexistence and fraternity which it has always been throughout its age-old history.25.	The choice for Israel is clear; does it want to contribute to peace  and to alleviate the sufferings endured by all the peoples of the area? If so  it must grasp this new opportunity which may not recur  recognize the inalienable  rights of the Palestinian people  particularly its right to a country  evacuate all Arab territories occupied in June 1967  put an end to the establishment of new Jewish settlements  and call a halt to committing sacrileges in the Holy Places of Islam. Or  on the contrary  does it want to continue to have recourse to all kinds of subterfuge in pursuing its policy of aggression and intimidation which is threatening peace in the area and international security? If it does  it will certainly find itself up against an Arab nation which has rallied together and which is determined to use all the means available to it in the service of justice and right.26.	We know that Israel is not animated by a genuine wish for peace  still less today with the accession to power of a new  more arrogant and  no doubt  more intransigent regime. The recent decisions to establish new settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan clearly demonstrate the scorn in which the new Israeli authorities hold the United Nations and the international community. The present invasion of the south of Lebanon also serves to demonstrate that peace is contrary to Israel's philosophy and its concepts of international relations.27.	Maybe Israel has been encouraged by  inter alia  certain unfortunate tensions created artificially here and there in the Arab world and which have divided fraternal States. It is true that to maintain those tensions is to harm the legitimate interests of the Arab nation and to strengthen the position of its enemies. But it is our conviction in Mauritania that the minor and pointless differences which damage our common cause will be rapidly resolved  and our natural solidarity will re-emerge with its full vigour and scope for the good of our peoples. Israel should therefore not count on these differences  which  I am absolutely convinced  are transient.28.	This is the view of my country with regard to the Middle East. Our solidarity with the Palestinian people represented by the PLO  with Egypt  with Syria and with Jordan has been total in the past. It is now and will remain so in the future.29.	Southern Africa and the Middle East have since the end of the Viet Nam war been  in our view  the most stubborn and at the same time the most explosive sources of tension. At any moment  violence may break out and assume vast proportions difficult to deal with and threatening the world with a general conflagration. With the proliferation of weapons of all kinds  the consequences are - unforeseeable. Awareness of this situation was no doubt what underlay the initiative of the non-aligned movement when it met last year at Colombo and recommended a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.130.	No initiative could be more judicious  politically as well as economically. Indeed  ever since the problem of disarmament first appeared on our agenda and since the international Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was signed  we have seen nothing but a headlong race to increase military arsenals. In a few years  according to expert estimates  some 30 or so countries will possess nuclear weapons. When one realizes that among them are South Africa and Israel  which are likely to secure the atomic weapon  we can truly understand the dimensions of this deadly danger to our universe. The super-Powers for their part  far from reducing their potential in this field  continue to manufacture new  ever-more sophisticated and infinitely deadlier weapons  each year swallowing up considerable sums of money which could have been used to alleviate suffering.31.	The cause of this arms race is  we think  to be sought not merely in a wish to achieve power and to dominate  but essentially in the absence of a global approach directed towards total and complete disarmament. The arms limitation agreements signed in connexion with the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  although representing a praiseworthy effort  and the partial prohibition of nuclear tests recommended by our General Assembly are mere palliatives  not a solution. Some Powers might legitimately have the impression  indeed  that the various attempts atlimitation are directed towards preserving the nuclear monopoly of the super-Powers  which are thus granting themselves a dominant status in world affairs.32.	This impression  no doubt justified  of military imbalance and insecurity has led to a generalized nuclear and conventional arms race. The General Assembly's forthcoming special session on disarmament should therefore  in our view  attempt to break new ground by proposing general and complete disarmament.' On that occasion a programme of action could be worked out made up of three elements  namely  the strengthening of the denuclearized zones; a precise policy of disarmament at the regional and world levels; and utilization of the resources thus released to assist development.33.	This last problem incidentally  and quite rightly  constitutes a major concern of the day  because hunger  disease and ignorance also make up a dangerous bomb that we must defuse as soon as possible. They are factors leading to instability and revolution  which always produce war and conflict. The international community is aware of this situation  and we are glad of it. In this regard  the United Nations has recommended in various documents a series of measures that would undoubtedly  if accepted  introduce a greater degree of justice and stability into international economic relations.34.	Outside our Organization  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  whose report has just been considered by the General Assembly at the 108th and 109th meetings of its thirty-first session  was one of the most appropriate bodies for debating such complex and controversial problems as those of energy  commodities and finance-just to mention a few. These problems are central concerns of the international community. Although that Conference gave the delegations taking part an opportunity to diagnose the most urgent problems facing the developing countries and to seek their solution on the basis of concrete proposals  we cannot but recognize that the results achieved fell well below the hopes that it had aroused.35.	The limited agreements  reached at the Conference were disappointing in terms both of their number and their nature  especially in the light of all the work and time required.36.	It would therefore be unrealistic  in our view  to speak of true progress towards the restructuring of international economic relations  still less of a substantial contribution to the development of the developing countries  which was the very purpose of the Conference. However  if there is anything to be said for the North-South dialogue  it is that it has proved that the United Nations system remains the most appropriate and most representative framework for world negotiations.37.	In the months and years to come  there can be no doubt that those negotiations will multiply and that they will extend to the whole of the economic and social sector. Indeed  it is public knowledge that today  on the threshold of the third development decade  the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade are still far from having been achieved. The results that were achieved  although they may vary from one sector to another  on the whole  fall far short of what was hoped for.38.	One of the areas where progress has certainly been slowest is international trade  and particularly trade in primary commodities.39.	The slow rate of progress recorded in that field is particularly alarming because this is a question of vital importance not only for the economy of the developing countries but also for the world economy as a whole.40.	Nevertheless  decisions taken in this regard at the fourth session of UNCTAD  as well as the agreement in principle on the establishment of a common fund achieved at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  provide a good basis for future action. These first steps are timid enough  and the implementation of the various decisions should be pursued with a greater degree of political will on the part of the developed countries. If this condition is met  there might be grounds for hoping that the plenipotentiaries meeting in the Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  which has been scheduled for next month  would reach an agreement on practical ways and means to set up a common fund.41.	The question of international trade is indissolubly linked with the questions of international monetary reform and the financing of development. Here again the application of the decisions of our Assembly leaves a great deal to be desired.42.	At the very time when a growing number of countries are encountering serious balance-of-payments difficulties  the trend that had been emerging towards a total reform of the international monetary system seems to have faltered as if the problems giving rise to that trend had all  as by magic  been completely and successfully solved. What is more  the agreement achieved at the seventh special session of the General Assembly on the need to establish a link between the creation of special drawing rights and the provision of supplementary development financing still remains to be followed up  while total public aid to development amounts to only half of the target figure laid down in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.43.	All these elements have  of course  been examined by the various bodies  and particularly by the fourth session of UNCTAD at Nairobi. But thus far it has not been possible to take concrete measures to promote the solution of urgent problems such as the indebtedness of developing countries  the financing of development  compensatory financing and so on. These are all problems that have quite rightly been considered sufficiently important to be the subject this year of a ministerial session of the Trade and Development Board.44.	With regard to agriculture  which is of particular concern to agricultural countries like mine  the assistance of the international community would be improved if it were increased and dispensed in such a way as to permit the developing countries to bring their agricultural output at least to the level recommended in the International Development Strategy.45.	Such an increase is particularly necessary because for the period 1971-1976 the growth rate of agricultural production in the developing countries was little over 2.5 per cent a year  a figure not only lower than the target laid down by the Strategy but also-and this is what worries us most—lower than the rate of 2.9 per cent achieved in the First Development Decade.46.	National and international food reserves for food security and emergency situations should also be set up as recommended by the World Food Conference.547.	The implementation of another recommendation of that Conference  namely  the establishment of an International Fund for Agricultural Development  will without a doubt constitute appreciable progress towards the improvement of the food situation in developing countries.48.	Co-operation among developing countries  whether it be technical or economic  is of particular importance in our view. Indeed  the feverish activity which has been under way in recent years at the international level will at least have taught us that the developing countries are themselves primarily responsible for their development.49.	Hunger  disease and ignorance  which are still dangerously rife in so many parts of the world  are problems which are too concrete and too serious for their solution to depend solely on the uncertain outcome of international meetings and conferences  no matter how specialized and representative they may be.50.	However  while the slow progress made so far in the adaptation of the world economic order—an adaptation that is now becoming urgent—justifies such pessimism  the international institutions concerned with finance and economic matters are performing work of capital importance in the furtherance of development and deserve close attention Despite the deficiencies of the present world system  the role played by IBRD  IMF or UNDP in development assistance remains an essential one for furthering the economic progress of our developing countries and for their social and cultural rehabilitation. Mauritania is aware of the importance of the role those institutions play and we wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and our willingness to continue to strengthen our co-operation with them.51.	That is the point of view of Mauritania on the principal problems which we consider today to be the essential concern of our world. There are  of course  other questions which should also receive our attention. Among them is respect for human rights wherever they are beingviolated. That is a goal which without doubt is important and is one which justifies any efforts that we may undertake to achieve it. My country is characterized by a policy of respect for human rights. We have no political prisoners  as shown by page 66 of the recent report of Amnesty International for the year 1976 6 and we have a clear conscience on this subject. We are ready to make our contribution to the efforts that will be decided upon in this respect by our Organization.52.	The return of the Comorian Island of Mayotte to the motherland is also an imperative necessity  as it is an objective of the Organization of African Unity. What we must do here is preserve the national unity and territorial integrity of the State of the Comoros  that young African country which has just acceded to international sovereignty and which needs internal peace in order to devote itself to the most urgent problems of economic development and social advancement. As a friendly country we appeal to France precisely in the name of the relations which I have just mentioned to facilitate and preserve the national unity of the Comoros.53.	In Mauritania we believe that if the international community succeeds in putting an end to the various sources of tension and in working out appropriate solutions for the establishment of a just and equitable international: economic order so as to give every country a sense of security  it will be the most far-reaching and finest task ever accomplished by man. Our generation will thus have rendered an immense service to future generations and will have saved humanity from an otherwise inevitable destruction. My country is ready to contribute with faith and determination to that task. The framework offered by the United Nations for its performance is both unique and perfectly suited to the task. The short-comings of our Organization  which some people deplore and which others decry  do not stem from any deficiency in the structure; they are the result of the absence of a genuine political will to make of the United Nations an instrument for economic advancement and for agreement among peoples. The Charter signed in San Francisco in 1945  in spite of some adjustments which have now become necessary  is still entirely up to date. I think that we all agree that the future effectiveness of our Organization will depend on our commitment and our sincere attachment to its ideals of peace and justice. For its part Mauritania will continue to give this Organization its whole-hearted support and will remain one of its most enthusiastic advocates. 		 	"
"88",4885,"MUS",32,1977,"﻿1.	Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of this thirty-second session of the General Assembly. As a representative of the non-aligned group of nations  with long years of service at the United Nations  you are eminently qualified to understand the problems which confront us today. I know that under your leadership and guidance this Assembly will make significant progress towards solving the political and economic problems which will be examined and debated over the following weeks. I wish to assure you that the Mauritius delegation will give you its full co-operation in the discharge of your duties and responsibilities.2.	I should also like to convey our deep appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  for his important and valuable contribution to the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.3.	May I also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff for their dedication to the objectives and goals of this Organization.4.	The opening of this session of the Assembly is a particularly happy occasion for us  for we welcome here to the United Nations for the first time the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  a nation whose people have struggled for many years against the most difficult odds to achieve freedom and independence. We congratulate them on their achievement of national unification and on their entry to this family of nations.5.	My delegation would also like to welcome the Republic of Djibouti  whose admission to the United Nations represents another important step in the process of decolonisation. We congratulate them on their independence.6.	We pledge our firm support and extend our full co-operation to the Governments and people of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.7.	The agenda of the General Assembly for the thirty- second session is a forbidding one. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in the coming weeks  and I should like to express the hope that we shall make real progress towards the goals we have been seeking to reach over the last few years. I think there is a renewed determination  particularly among the non-aligned countries  to seek to achieve such progress and to realize the promise which this Organization has always held out to the nations of the world.8.	I wish today to try to place-the agenda of the present session in its proper perspective  and by that I mean that today we are witnessing the breakdown of the old world order inherited from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. That order was a world system of inequality. It came into being by historical accident  in which the industrial revolution took place in one particular part of the world and the colonial powers of Europe expanded into and subjugated much of the rest of the world. While the power of the old system has become greater and more coherent since the end of the First World War  the whole system has also been subject to increasing stresses.9.	However  it is also clear that the privileged and the powerful are seeking to preserve what they have  to keep intact the world system which has made development almost impossible for the poor countries. That may seem natural and it may well be that the privileged and the powerful believe the present world order to be beneficial to everyone. But this Assembly knows that such a notion is an illusion. The present world system of inequality cannot continue because it condemns the mass of the world's people to lives of brutal poverty and suffering. Our agenda is what it is today because the voices of the world's peoples are beginning to be heard in this Assembly.10.	It seems particularly-fitting that it should fall to a member of the non-aligned group  and an African member  to underline the historical significance of the present session and of those sessions that will come  for my country lived the history of the typical colony.11.	Today we know what inequality  helplessness and poverty meant then. When we look at the problems confronting this Assembly we see that what is happening here is very similar to our own struggle for freedom  independence and social justice. To the extent that power and wealth are still unequally distributed in the world  the poor and the underprivileged continue to exist in a state of want and despair. Therefore  we see the work of the General Assembly as essentially part of the struggle to change that situation  to dismantle the world system of inequality and  it is to be hoped  to ensure that every nation shall attain true freedom and independence.12.	The fundamental problems of the world today are clearly economic. In the decade after the founding of the United Nations  it was hoped that by a concerted international effort the nations gathered in this Assembly would be able to eradicate poverty in the world. This proved to be impossible within the structure of the present world economy. More than 60 per cent of the world's population lives today in abject poverty. Nearly 1 billion people have been classified as destitute  and it is clear from the available evidence that the poor countries of the world are likely to become poorer in the future if the efforts to create a new international economic order should fail.13.	We must be clear about the reasons for the failure of our efforts to promote development in the poor countries. The developed countries have vast amounts of capital  very high levels of income and large numbers of trained men and women. They control access to technical knowledge. The poor countries  on the other hand  lack all these elements. But what is more important  they are dependent on the wealthy nations. the terms of trade run against the poor  who are forced increasingly into debt. They have growing deficits in their trade  and their resources are increasingly controlled by transnational corporations. The world system of trade and payments works against them  forcing periodic devaluation or the retrenchment of development programmes.14.	Thus  we continue to live in a global economy marked by most extreme inequalities. Within that system the poor countries grow increasingly dependent  and that dependence makes development difficult. In fact  the nations of the third world have relatively little control over their economic destinies.15.	At the last session  the General Assembly recommended a series of special measures and specific action in favour of the land-locked and island developing countries. We shall follow with the utmost attention the Secretary- General's progress report on the implementation of specific action in favour of developing island countries . As regards the debt problems of the developing countries discussed in other bodies  it is sad to note that the results of those negotiations are so far negative. The developed countries are chary about reaching agreement on concrete measures to provide a solution of those problems. While they have endorsed the UNCTAD resolution on theIntegrated Programme for Commodities' and have welcomed the establishment of an Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Committee for the Integrated Programme for Commodities  little progress has been made so far towards the establishment of a common fund. We can only hope that next November  at the resumption of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  a more constructive and willing approach will be forthcoming from the developed countries.16.	We. must ensure the eradication of poverty  hunger  sickness and illiteracy. Therefore  the creation of a new economic order is the most urgent task before us  for the widening gap between the rich and the poor is one of the main sources  if not the main source  of tensions and conflicts in the world today. The peace and security of the world will therefore  to an important degree  depend upon the progress we make in moving towards that goal.17.	Though the North-South dialogue  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and the fourth session of UNCTAD have proved negative so far  we hope that better counsels will prevail in the future.18.	It is absolutely essential that the international community should move rapidly and positively towards concrete solutions in establishing the new international economic order  and I should like on behalf of my delegation to call upon all delegations to make a special effort to achieve this goal.19.	I think that this Assembly might  in the course of its deliberations  find it useful to explore the connexions between a development strategy aimed at meeting basic needs and the problem of the creation of a new international economic order. The response of the wealthy nations to the demands for a new order have shown that one can mean many things by the term  new international economic order .20.	The conflicts in southern Africa and in the Middle East have now become pressing problems for the whole international community. We shall spend a good deal of our time in the coming weeks in seeking acceptable solutions. We must do so with an utmost sense of urgency  for in both southern Africa and the Middle East the threat to peace is a real one.21.	It is important to note  in my view  that both conflicts are signs of the break-down of the world system of which I spoke earlier. Southern Africa  for instance  has been encouraged to resist the demands for an end to colonialism and the elimination of apartheid. When Caetano was still in power in Portugal  he received considerable financial  diplomatic and military assistance from other Powers  and  although the liberation forces did eventually win freedom for Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau  the effect was to prolong the wars of liberation and to inflict unnecessary suffering on the people.22.	The victory of the liberation forces in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau showed that the balance of forces in the world was changing. There is no longer any real possibility of preserving the economic  social and political structures left behind in the region by the colonial Powers.23.	Yet the efforts to preserve them persist. The illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia continues to fight  and South Africa continues to occupy Namibia illegally.24.	I want here to reaffirm the unquestionable and inalienable rights of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination  freedom and independence. The illegal racist minority regime  if only for its brutal and repressive- measures perpetrated against our brothers and sisters of Zimbabwe  deserves the strongest condemnation. Last year  we expressed the hope that the talks on Zimbabwe at Geneva would succeed in establishing the conditions for early independence on the basis of majority rule. Unfortunately  little did we realize that Ian Smith incarnated the evil forces of colonialism. We are now more confident that  faced with the growing pressure of world public opinion  the illegal racist minority regime will be forced to accept the inevitable majority rule. Otherwise  we shall continue to accelerate the use of force by all possible means. The Anglo-American proposal has not received the support it expected because it lacked certain flexibility to enable us to ensure the inherent right of the people of Zimbabwe without further effusion of blood.25.	There was much hope last year that the Namibian problem would be solved. Unfortunately the South African racist regime  by its military build-up in the area and its dilatory tactics  is deliberately obstructing the struggle for self-determination and independence. The policy of apartheid will inevitably lead to the destruction of the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.26.	All possible support and assistance should be given to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) to enable it to intensify the struggle against the illegal occupation of Namibia. The Assembly should reaffirm its support for the pre-conditions set by SWAPO for a negotiated agreement to end the occupation.27.	The efforts of the five members of the Security Council of the United Nations should be pursued with the good offices of the Secretary-General. That is the only way out and it is hoped that a settlement will be arrived at speedily. My delegation also believes that resolution 385(1976) of the Security Council  which provides the framework for negotiations and the settlement of the Namibian issue  must be implemented without any further delay.28.	The Maputo Declaration and the Programme of Action approved by the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia in Mayshould be seen as guidelines for our deliberations on these matters here. With respect to South Africa  we should like to call the attention of representatives to the important statement made in the final communiqué of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London from 8 to 15 June and to the Declaration of the World Conference for Action against Apartheid organized under the auspices of the United Nations and held in Lagos in August.29.	The Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and the co-chairmanship of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  will alone provide the framework for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area. In the meantime  Israel must stop its policy of expansion through the consolidation of the illegally occupied territories. It must show good faith by overt measures conducive to the restoration of peace in the area.30.	It is the duty of the world community to ensure that the welfare and the rights of the population of the occupied territories are safeguarded. Mauritius supports the Egyptian proposal concerning the new item which has been included in our agenda  relating to the illegal measures taken by Israel  which constitute insuperable obstacles to peace.31.	At this juncture let us hope that war-torn Lebanon will also henceforth be allowed to return to a peaceful life permitting its sorely needed reconstruction and reconciliation.32.	The problem of Cyprus deserves our special attention as the present position bristles with potential dangers to peace in that particular area. The United Nations should use all possible means and measures to bring the different parties to a just and peaceful settlement.33.	Mauritius has become a sponsor of the draft world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations because we are convinced that the use or threat of force in relations among States should be placed outside the realm of legality. Though the United Nations Charter contains provisions prohibiting the use or threat of force  we feel that there is need for a more comprehensive and effective legal instrument which would define and strengthen the general principles enshrined in the Charter. While sponsoring the draft proposed by the Soviet Union  we intend to introduce some amendments to it.34.	Concurrently  efforts should be stepped up to reach general agreement on the prohibition of those weapons that are excessively injurious and which inflict unnecessary suffering. I mean napalm and other incendiary weapons  as well as chemical and bacteriological weapons. We have to prohibit the production and stockpiling of such weapons and urge States to eliminate them from their arsenals. The arms race is a very great threat  if not the only great threat  to the survival of humanity. A positive step was made with the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. We cannot but urge those countries that are not yet parties to this Treaty to accede to it  as it provides the nucleus which will ultimately lead to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Our objectives in the course of the Disarmament Decade should be the reduction of military expenditure  complete and general disarmament  and  above all  the halt of the arms race  especially in the nuclear field. Here the deep aspiration for peace of the peoples of the world is manifest in their calling for the establishment of nuclear-free zones in the Middle East  in South Asia and in Africa.35.	We in Africa have repeatedly reaffirmed our Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  which calls upon all States to respect the continent of Africa as a nuclear-free zone and we appealed again last year to all States not to deliver to South Africa or place at its disposal any equipment or fissionable material or technology that would enable the racist regime of South Africa to acquire nuclear-weapon capability. We would regret any such move.36.	My delegation trusts that some of these questions of disarmament will be dealt with at length in the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament to be held in May of this coming year.37.	Mauritius  as you know  has been a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean since 1972 and as such has been consistently trying to ensure that the Indian Ocean becomes  in reality  a zone of peace. We have been calling on the great Powers to refrain from increasing their military presence in the Indian Ocean  and now  after consultations with the great Powers and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean  the Committee believes-that the time is ripe for a conference on the Indian Ocean with the participation of all the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.38.	This conference would complement the efforts made by the World Disarmament Conference to create zones of peace  dismantle all foreign bases and to achieve complete disarmament. The attainment of these objectives would eventually lead to the strengthening of international security. All these issues are interrelated. The human and material resources freed by disarmament could be used to promote the economic and social development and welfare of the developing countries and bring happiness to billions of poor and underprivileged peoples.39.	At its last session the Assembly adopted a resolution on non-interference in the internal affairs of States  which reaffirmed the right of every State to determine freely its political  social and economic system and its relations with other States and international organizations. The time has now come to seek ways and means to give force to the terms of that resolution. Indeed  that is essential if we are to avoid  in this transitional period of history  the danger of spreading war.40.	Finally  I should like to say something about the important question of human rights. As many of you know  1 have long been concerned with this question myself. And I believe it is important today to confront the issues posed by the widening discussion on human rights-a discussion which is desirable and proper but which also sometimes creates widening rings.41.	We must recognize that the denial of human rights is still widespread. This is a lamentable fact of the twentieth century  though it must be acknowledged that the world has made great progress in ensuring human rights. Repression and torture and the denial of basic rights are widespread today. In our view the solution lies in directing our concern towards our own problems. Rather than criticizing others  it would be better that we each put our house in order. Real efforts in this direction would be the best guarantee that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would be universally respected in the future.42.	As the Assembly is aware  it is some time now since Mauritius ratified and acceded to several multilateral Treaties bearing on human rights issues  namely  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights; and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  as well as the Optional Protocol on this subject.43.	Thus  since our independence less than a decade ago we have consistently made tremendous progress in this field. It is the inherent birthright of the individual to live a decent life in freedom and dignity.44.	Our achievements illustrate our efforts in this field. Apart from freedom of movement and association  we have adopted legislation making 18 the age for the exercise of civil and political rights. Furthermore  the following basic rights have now become inherent characteristics of Mauritian society: economic and socio-cultural rights  including freedom of worship  free education  free health care and social benefits for the aged  the poor and the handicapped; the elimination of all forms of discrimination based on language  colour or creed; guaranteed equality of status for women; freedom of information through press  television and radio; and freedom of assembly in peace and order.45.	Since the General Assembly proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year considerable progress has been made in favour of women. The period from 1976 to 1985 has been proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace. Governments are called upon to develop extensive training programmes relevant to women and to integrate women into the development process or to ratify international conventions concerning women's rights. At its last session  the Commission on the Status of Women completed a draft convention on the elimination  of discrimination against women  Mauritius concurs with the recommendation made by theEconomic and Social Council in its resolution 2058 (LXII) that that draft should be considered as a matter of urgency with a view to its adoption.46.	Youth has an important part to play in promoting the objectives of the United Nations  and in that spirit youth should be actively involved in programmes of national development and international co-operation. We welcome the various reports on the role of youth and the problems confronting it. We are confident that the widening of the channels of communication between the United Nations and youth organizations will lead to greater understanding and a stronger spirit of brotherhood among men.47.	The world is craving peace and prosperity. May those nations blessed with the means and the power to relieve such world pressures be imbued with such altruism that this year will witness a positive and constructive approach to the establishment of a better world for us to live in. Let them prove themselves more adaptable to this changing world  for this will stand them in good stead for whatever traumas may be on the horizon.	 "
"89",4927,"MWI",32,1977,"﻿112.	Mr. President  just as the speakers who have preceded me have rightly done  I  too  congratulate you upon your election as President of this year's session of this Assembly. The responsibilities devolving on the holder of that high office are not only arduous but also very demanding. Indeed the task before you calls for a high degree of patience  fairness and impartiality. Happily these qualities are not lacking in your person. I have no doubt  therefore  that the Assembly could not have made a better choice. It only remains then for me to assure you of my delegation's co-operation.113.	I should like also  with your permission  to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  who presided superbly over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly and steered its deliberations to a satisfactory conclusion.114.	It would be remiss of me if I did not in like manner pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His is an unenviable position and his responsibilities are enormous. My Government appreciates the difficulties he has in serving  to the satisfaction of all  a membership that is as a matter of principle equal in sovereignty but yet different in other aspects  such as population  economic strength  military might and  of course  political outlook. I am sure that representatives will agree with me that Mr. Waldheim has acquitted himself well in the discharge of his duties. My Government therefore regards his reappointment for a second term of office as a fitting tribute to his dedication to duty and his total commitment to international peace and stability.115.	We are meeting at the thirty-second session of the Assembly at a time when we face a global situation which gives both encouragement and grave concern: encouragement because  since we met last  there have been some signs of a decrease in tension in some areas of conflict and some progress towards the goal of achieving self-determination for all peoples of the world; and concern because in others of those areas tensions have escalated.116.	My delegation welcomes the lessening of tension in East-West relations manifested in the detente that has been taking place. We have noted with satisfaction the consolidation of peace in South-East Asia  it possible for the peoples of that region to assume their rightful place in the community of nations. In this connexion my delegation welcomes the membership of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in the United Nations.117.	These developments give mankind a ray of hope that our world can be made a little safer and demonstrate the usefulness of contact and dialogue as a means of solving problems.118.	My delegation has also noted with satisfaction that the process of decolonization in Africa  though still not completed  has achieved yet another step forward. A fitting illustration of this is the presence in our midst today of the new sister State of Djibouti as a Member of the United Nations. My delegation welcomes the membership of Djibouti and has no doubt that our Organization will be the richer for it. In recognition of this development the Malawi delegation extends its heartiest congratulations to the Government and people of the new Republic of Djibouti on the attainment of their nationhood. My delegation also extends similar congratulations to the Government of France for expediting the process of decolonization in the Horn of Africa.119.	There are  however  disturbing developments in other parts of our continent of Africa. In southern Africa  for instance  the problems related to the denial of political rights to the majority governments remain unresolved and the situation has now become serious.120.	We are a part of that trouble-stricken region of southern Africa. We live with the situation day in and day out. We are thus among the best placed to understand the scope and magnitude of the problems of the area. By the same token  what happens there affects us in some way or other. Malawi has made no secret of it: abhorrence of and distaste for the existing racial policies in South Africa. We have condemned apartheid and the methods used to enforce it; we continue to do so to this day.121.	In pursuit of its policy of apartheid  the South African Government last year granted so-called independence to an area of that country called the Transkei. Later this year  yet another area will be granted the same sort of independence. My Government rejects this type of independence. Therefore  Malawi could not and did not recognize the Transkei as a sovereign State  neither will it recognize any other area which is granted such paper independence.122.	But my Government has not stopped only at condemning apartheid. We have called upon the South African Government and the white people in that country to change. However  we have done that not with any rhetorical platitudes. We have done so in the context of political reality as we see it today. That is why we have preferred to employ persuasive means of contact and dialogue  as opposed to isolation and ostracism. We believe that this is a matter in which we  the truly independent black African States  must give the lead and example to the whites to the south of us. We believe that by seeing how black Africans treat the white citizens of their respective countries  the whites in the Republic of South Africa can be influenced to change  as they are assured that all we are against is the political system they pursue and not them as persons.123.	In Rhodesia  regrettably  the political deadlock remains unresolved. Indeed  the position has become even more acute. As representatives have already heard  lives are being lost there—the lives of people fighting for their political rights. We are happy  however  that the United Kingdom  whose responsibility Rhodesia is  in conjunction with the United States  has now taken positive steps to find a solution of the problem through peaceful means. We note with satisfaction also the positive decision adopted by the United Nations Security Council a fortnight ago in its resolution 415 (1977)  endorsing these efforts.124.	I wish to record Malawi's support for these efforts  and any others that are directed towards finding a peaceful solution of the Rhodesian issue. We pray and hope that it will not be long before we welcome a free Zimbabwe into the community of free nations.125.	I should also like to record Malawi's support for the efforts being made by five Western countries of the Security Council  namely  the United Kingdom  the United States  France  Canada  and the Federal Republic of Germany  to find  on the basis of Council resolution 385 (1976) of January 1976  an internationally acceptable solution of the problem of independence for South West Africa (Namibia)  again through peaceful means. My delegation has noted the positive steps taken by the Government of South Africa in this connexion  and hopes that good faith will prevail on all sides to ensure a successful conclusion to this long-standing problem. As with Rhodesia  we hope that an independent Namibia will soon emerge.126.	Change is inevitable in southern Africa. How soon it will come  however  will depend on our efforts to make the recalcitrant elements realize that time is not on their side. We must therefore create a climate that will lead them to respond positively to the call for change. In this respect  I make bold to say that Malawi has always been in the forefront in advocating peaceful change in our region of Africa. My Government has noted the positive development of the process of contact and dialogue which is manifested in a number of current developments. It is the Malawi Government's intention to continue to play a leading role in the creation of a permanent climate conducive to the rapid change desired by the international community.127.	Another troubled area whose problems continue to confront this Assembly year after year is that of the Middle East. We have welcomed and  indeed  followed with interest in recent months the efforts of the United States to find a way to bring to a conference table the various parties to the conflict. We have also noted the joint declaration issued on 1 October  over a week ago  by the two Co-Chairmen of the adjourned Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  the United States and the Soviet Union  as a further step towards facilitating the resumption of the Conference. It is our sincere hope that a solution will be found which will take into account the fears  hopes  needs and aspirations of all the people in the region. We believe that this can be achieved  given good will and a willingness to compromise among the parties concerned. For only then can genuine  lasting peace be assured.128.	My Government has noted with great concern the continuing sale of sophisticated and very costly military hardware to young nations by major Powers. We are- concerned not only that these weapons drain the meagre resources of these emerging nations. The sale of arms does great harm to international relations and increases the threat to world peace. My Government is further concerned about the continuing nuclear proliferation on the international scene. Malawi can see no need for the increased manufacture of these instruments of mass destruction at a time when the United Nations is committed to a search for international peace.129.	As a developing nation  Malawi is concerned about the enormous amounts of money expended on the purchase of military hardware. I am informed that the developing nations have been known to have spent at least $40 billion in one year on the purchase of weapons. It can only be left to the imagination how much the manufacturing Powers must spend on the development of these weapons. Malawi believes that these resources could be better spent on improving the welfare of mankind than on threatening its security and peace. My Government  therefore  looks forward to a day when this body might meet to discuss ways and means of channelling such resources towards the elimination of poverty and disease  thereby bringing a good life to the entire international community. It is my Government's hope also that the current efforts at limiting the development of strategic arms among the super-Powers not only will continue but also will be matched by equal attempts at reducing the sale of unnecessary military hardware to developing nations  particularly us African nations  so that we can devote our time and resources to the task of improving the living standards of our people.130.	When I last had the privilege of addressing this Assembly  I touched briefly on a historic event which promised the advent of a new era in trade and economic relations between developing and developed countries. This was the signing in April 1975 of the Lome Convention  under which 46 African  Caribbean and Pacific countries (the ACP group) and the nine members of the European Economic Community [EEC] agreed to regulate their trade and economic relations to their mutual benefit. The establishment of the Lome Convention was achieved because both the ACP Group and the EEC had agreed to negotiate in a spirit of compromise and realism  realizing that their economic interests were intertwined.131.	Events in recent years have shown that  ultimately  developing and developed countries are economically dependent on each other and that the irresponsibility of one is detrimental to both. Developing countries provide not only the source of raw materials for the developed ones  but also the larger market for the finished goods produced by the latter. The ability of the developing countries to produce the raw materials and ensure markets for the developed countries depends on their economic stability and solvency. Unless the developing countries are able to sell at profitable prices  they cannot expand their productive capability  nor can they ensure a market for their finished goods. The continued economic stability of the developed countries depends on the economic viability of the developing ones.132.	My country had hoped that the example of the ACP/EEC Convention of Lome might encourage the participants in the negotiations between developing and developed countries  the Conference on International Economic Cooperation or North-South dialogue  which ended in Paris early this year  to take bold steps towards achieving the long-expected new economic order. We had hoped  perhaps naively  that the time had passed when narrow interests and bullish attitudes were allowed to cloud reality; we had hoped that the era that the signing of the Lome Convention promised to usher in had finally come. It was  therefore  with great disappointment that my country saw the dialogue drift on to an inconclusive end  bogged down by old parochial attitudes.133.	It is Malawi's sincere hope that the North-South dialogue can be resumed and that  when negotiations restart  realism and compromise will be the guiding principles. Malawi has been encouraged by the courageous steps taken by the Government of Canada  a Co-Chairman of the North-South dialogue  in deciding to convert into grants all Canadian loans to developing countries. It is our hope that others will give this example great consideration  as this will not only generate much goodwill between the developed and developing countries but also enable the latter to break out of the cycle that keeps them in perpetual debt and hinders their development. Developing countries will continue to need assistance from developed ones; but we believe that this assistance should be designed to help those to whom it is given to be independent and not perpetually dependent.134.	While problems and conflicts among nations continue in various parts of the world  my Government notes that peace and understanding have been achieved in many areas through the initiative and mediation of the United Nations. My Government appreciates all that is being done by this Organization in promoting peace-and understanding among nations. Permit me to reiterate my country's readiness to contribute towards making this Organization a medium for ensuring the broadest co-operation among Members in order to promote world peace  understanding and security.135.	My delegation also notes the continuing interest and work of the United Nations in promoting and improving the economic  cultural and social well-being of the peoples of the world. In this connexion  I want to take this opportunity to express once again my country's appreciation for the assistance it continues to receive from the various United Nations agencies. This assistance is of great importance in our task of promoting the economic and social development of our nation.136.	I now wish to convey to this Assembly best wishes from my President and the Government and people of Malawi for every success in its deliberations.  "
"90",4968,"MYS",32,1977,"﻿61.	 May I  first of all  congratulate Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia  on his election as President of this session of the United Nations General Assembly. Malaysia has the highest regard for Yugoslavia  especially for being a founder-member of the non-aligned movement  of which Malaysia is a member  and also for its efforts over the years in promoting world peace and goodwill. Your election  Mr. President  .is therefore a reflection of our respect and honour for your great country. Your experience and skill will no doubt be of great value to the deliberations of this General Assembly  and my country will give its fullest co-operation to you.62.	To Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka I express my thanks for the admirable manner in which he carried out his duties and responsibilities as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.63.	Mr. Kurt Waldheim has served the United Nations extremely well. He has been untiring in his efforts to achieve the purposes and objectives of this great world Organization. We are very glad that he has agreed to serve again  and we wish him success in all his endeavours.64.	The United Nations is richer by the addition of two new Members  Malaysia welcomes the admission of the Republic of Djibouti into the Organization and looks forward to working with it inside and outside the United Nations.65.	Malaysia also welcomes the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam into this great family of nations. Our two countries are close neighbours  and Malaysia is confident that the friendly relations that have already been established between the two countries will be further strengthened. We hope that there will be further and closer contacts and co-operation between our two countries.66.	Over the years the United Nations has had a number of successes with regard to its decolonization policy. There are  however  still a number of areas in the world where this policy has yet to be implemented. Malaysia will continue to support this policy.67.	However  in some other fields the United Nations is far from being effective; its resolutions and appeals have contemptuously been disregarded. Israel is an example. There will never be any peace and stability in the Middle East until Israel withdraws from all the lands it has taken from Arab countries and until it agrees to the establishment of a homeland for the Palestinians. Malaysia fully supports the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East immediately to resolve the problems in the Middle East. As the Palestinians are also affected  the Palestine Liberation Organization  which we recognize as their representative  should also attend the Conference.68.	Southern Africa is another example. The majority of the countries Members of the United Nations will never tolerate or keep quiet about colonial oppression  racism and apartheid. What is now happening in that part of the world is so contemptible that it is only a matter of time before it will erupt into a violent explosion that may envelop a large part of the continent of Africa. Immediate actions and solutions are needed before it is too late.69.	In my part of the world  that is South-East Asia  some countries in the region  including Malaysia  are learning to work together for our mutual benefit. We believe in regional co-operation  especially in the economic  industrial  social and cultural fields. In the process we have achieved a measure of peace and stability.70.	We are thus able to concentrate all our efforts and energy on the growth of our economy and the development of our countries. The Association of South-East Asian Nations has been a great worthy experiment in regional co-operation in my part of the world. It has been found to be workable and viable. It is far from .being perfect  of course. But we are determined and patient enough to ensure its survival  continuity and progress.71.	Malaysia strongly believes that there can be no growth in the economy and very little development in a country without peace and stability. Super-Power rivalry has also infested my part of the world. This rivalry will only bring destruction and misery to the small countries. To avoid that  Malaysia has proposed the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia  which would be free from interference in any form or manner by outside Powers. Malaysia needs the support of all countries in the United Nations  especially the big Powers  in turning this concept into a reality.72.	Almost all the developing countries are producers of primary commodities. These commodities are essential to the industrialized countries. The developing countries  on the other hand  are dependent on the industrialized countries for the supply of machinery  equipment and manufactured goods. Thus  these two groups of countries are dependent on each other for their livelihood and well-being. Unfortunately  the trend has always been that the developing countries are paid less for their produce  while the industrialized countries always charge more for their goods.73.	This state of affairs cannot go on forever. Obviously a new international economic order must replace the current one  which is so patently inequitable and unjust. Much time and thought have been given to these issues. The Integrated Programme for Commodities of UNCTAD deserves to be supported and should be supported. This session of the General Assembly should ensure that the programme be implemented with the utmost urgency. While it is right and proper that the United Nations should be very concerned with the question of war and peace  it should equally be very concerned with the question of the world economy  which can also bring about conflict and chaos in the world.74.	I am greatly encouraged by the agreement in the recently concluded Conference on International Economic Co-operation to establish a common fund which should be a major source of finance for the integrated programme for commodities. Malaysia agrees with the view that the common fund should principally be for financing international buffer stocks of commodities to achieve greater stability in commodity prices at levels which are remunerative to producers and fair to consumers. In this way developing countries  such as Malaysia  can plan and develop their export commodities with the confidence that the livelihood of their peoples will be safeguarded.75.	I hope that  following the agreement at the Conference on International Economic Co-Operation to broaden the scope of co-operation between the developed and the developing countries  there will be a more positive outlook and a greater sense of urgency on the part of the developed countries to ensure a successful outcome of the second round of negotiations under UNCTAD on the common fund.76.	The urgency of establishing the new international economic order needs no stressing. All indications are that the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  now in its seventh year  has failed to achieve even its basic objectives. It is also clear that the present international economic system is no longer relevant  and has not been able to cope with or to offer effective solutions to the problems concerning trade  commodities  industrialization  transfer of technology  transfer of resources  food and agriculture  and the reform of the international monetary system.77.	Furthermore  discussions and negotiations that have been going on with the developed countries in the last two and a half decades have only resulted in greater disparity between the developed and developing countries  and the worsening of the position of the latter.78.	For the developed countries this is a real test of their leadership  vision and sincerity. We have spoken a great deal about interdependence and political will. Now is the time for these countries to come forward with clear  unambiguous  firm and meaningful commitments to the realization and early establishment of the new international economic order. 1 would  therefore  urge this Assembly to identify its short-term and long-term objectives with respect to the new international economic order.79.	In the short term  it is necessary for the United Nations to take the initiatives that would provide the machinery for better international co-operation and coordination of national economic policies  so as to introduce a stronger basis for sustained economic growth and financial stability on a global scale. But the world has gone through a major recession  from which it has not yet fully recovered. There are still some of the after-effects of this recession within the international economic system. This is inhibiting a more rapid economic recovery and the achievement of sustained economic growth that is so vitally necessary for the economic well-being and security of the whole world.80.	The United Nations should therefore strengthen its existing machinery and devise new systems that could create a better economic environment which would also discourage the recent trend towards protectionism that is growing  especially among the major industrial countries. Any acceleration of this protectionist trend could bring about a severe setback to world economic recovery and  indeed  cause major and even lasting disruptions to the economic well-being and prospects of developing countries in particular.81.	In the longer term the United Nations must be able to gear itself and adopt more innovative measures to restructure the international economic system. There is a growing realization that we need to make better use of the United Nations system as a forum for negotiations towards the gradual achievement of the new international economic order. The many international conferences that have been held  and more recently the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  have all been disappointing  and at best have shown only limited results. The time has come  therefore  to return more resolutely to the United Nations to seek world solutions to our global problems.82.	I would suggest  therefore  that this Assembly urge all its organizations  institutions and conferences to identify the most pressing economic issues of the day  and to set definite time targets to achieve as much agreement as possible.83.	Unless we undertake the initiatives to take substantive and concrete action within definite time targets we will run into the danger of having consultations and dialogues in a vacuum  with much to be said but with little done. I do not think that posterity will judge us kindly if we fail to alleviate the problems we are facing owing to the lack of political will and responsibility. This is indeed the time to be bold and decisive  and I hope that we will be able to live up to what is expected of us for the benefit of us all."
"91",5041,"NER",32,1977,"﻿213.	The thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly is opening in a world characterized by political uncertainty and economic anxiety. Some  and by no means the least  of the problems which were the subject of our concern at previous sessions still await satisfactory solutions.214.	It is as though we were living in a period of deliberate disorder  of a determination to seek destruction  and an absolute refusal to accept the improvements and progress needed by millions of disadvantaged men who are sometimes denied even an identity.215.	The thirty-second session is another occasion for us to express our fears and hopes. Can the world finally seize this moment to try to conquer the demons of dispute and self-interest?216.	Permit me to welcome the first act of this session  namely  the admission into the international community of the sister Republic of Djibouti and of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Our Organization  by enriching itself with those two new eminent Members  is drawing close to its true goal of universality  with respect for the rights of peoples to live freely in a world of peace and justice.217.	The peoples of Djibouti and Viet Nam will  we are convinced  bring to the international community not only their experience  but above all their desire and willingness to work for peace—qualities which the whole world has always recognized in them. They should be congratulated on their courageous struggles as a result of which they are here today. Their presence here is a victory for all enslaved and shackled peoples struggling to regain their identity and their rights. The decolonization process is irreversible  and we still await the decolonization of peoples of other States deprived of their elementary rights under the colonialist yoke.218.	Since the historic date of 15 April 1974  the Supreme Military Council and the Government  drawing wise lessons from a long and painful experience  have set about seeking a better existence for the people of Niger  in accordance with their natural aspirations for peace and security. We have undertaken the creation and consolidation of this better existence within the framework of a national struggle against under-development  the establishment of social justice and the constant reaffirmation of our national identity.219.	The long and terrible years of unbroken drought are still fresh in our memories  and the efforts undertaken for the development of our natural resources and in the search for self-sufficiency in food production constitute today a clear motivation for a common mobilization of all our citizens. For example  national organizations of young men and women  throughout the vast territory of 1 267 000 square kilometres  are engaged in collective activities in the fields of social self-help  development and the reconstruction of the cultural heritage of the national community.220.	This national mobilization can be seen today in the systematic tripling of our general national budget  which bears witness to our firm desire to make progress on the road of national development; for the Niger of today rejects verbal  dilatory progressivism which deceives no one; rather  we are pursuing true progress in keeping- with our true nature—progress which liberates man from natural fetters  from poverty  famine and ignorance  progress towards the goal of permitting everyone to achieve the full flowering of his physical and spiritual personality.221.	Thus it was that on 4 August last  Lieutenant-Colonel Seyni Kountche solemnly opened the Conference of leaders and diplomats of Niger with these words:""Since 15 April 1974  our national development efforts have sought to create a developing society by stressing in particular social justice and a better division of national wealth.... We have intensified the search for economic independence  notably by the development of industrial  mining and trade activities; we have also improved the national transport network  and we are undertaking the diversification of our country's means of access to the sea. But we are concerned  above all  with the destiny of our compatriots living in rural areas... Hence we have undertaken a vast project to increase the number of wells and replace the livestock decimated by the drought. These efforts aimed at our rural masses have produced among them a rebirth of enthusiasm and of confidence in the future. Everywhere in our villages  the incentive is to work in order to produce more  so that the spectre of famine may forever be dispelled. But however positive and comforting these results may be  we must not forget that the task before us is still immense  and that we shall still require outside assistance for a long time.""222.	As to our foreign policy  it resist on two major principles through which the diplomacy of the new Niger is expressed: first  that of non-alignment  a positive non- alignment based on our will to assert our- national identity and our international sovereignty; and  secondly  cooperation  multilateral co-operation inspired by that non- alignment and flowing from our commitment to open our doors to all countries which share our views and concerns. The essence of this co-operation remains the promotion of the structural development of our economy.223.	At the regional and African level  I am pleased to proclaim our dedication-a dedication that has never gone un-rewarded to a policy of co-operation and dialogue and  above all  of good neighbourliness and socio-economic 'integration with all States of the sub region. That is why  without prejudice to the arrangements establishment by the QAU  the Government of Niger  in collaboration or in parallel with other African Governments  has made attempts at mediation with a view to smoothing out differences and finding peaceful solutions to various disputes in order to preserve and consolidate what we hold most dear: our independence. As in the past  Niger will pursue its natural role of promoting mediation and the rapprochement of peoples and their ideas  because we have faith in the virtues of dialogue among brothers  and because we remain convinced that Africa will be liberated only by its sons  and that its sons will be able to liberate it ' only if they are united among themselves. They have the ability-because they have proved it repeatedly-to overcome their differences.224.	At the international level our country  through its association with the countries of Africa  the Caribbean' and the Pacific with the nine countries of the European Economic Community has  ever since the signing of the Lome Convention  expressed its faith in co-operation within vast and enriching groups. It is in this spirit that our country wages the struggle within the non-aligned group  the Group of 77 and the Islamic Conference. It is working actively for rapprochement and solidarity among African and Arab countries.225.	The meagre results of the various development strategies conceived by the United Nations cannot leave us indifferent. There is a time for everything. We can feel the moment coming when the log-jams will break up of their own accord. Failures cannot go on accumulating indefinitely without awakening pangs of conscience.226.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation  or North-South dialogue—and here we commend the initiative of France that brought it about-had for a moment led us to believe that it would bring about a noticeable change in international economic relations. Unfortunately  it wound up in deadlock which political will on part of the developed countries could have resolved without difficulty. The token assistance given condescendingly to those left behind by development can in no case be presented as a significant positive factor capable of satisfying the immense development needs of the countries of the third world. The establishment of a new international economic order also represents an opportunity for the industrialized countries  because the reconversion of their economies is inconceivable without the development of the under-developed countries.227.	We must resolve to accept this truth just as we accept the need to exist with others rather than being pitted against them. The economy is ceasing more and more to be a national affair: it is becoming a world-wide matter. It is better to take note of the situation now and have the courage to see things as they have always been-as a completely worn-out legacy of ideas and concepts from the last century and past decades. The survival of the industrialized world depends on its ensuring the development of the developing countries. But  above all  those developing countries must organize themselves. They must consider the perhaps salutary possibilities of establishing organized and dynamic machinery for horizontal co-operation. And here I should like to commend the start made at the eleventh extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAIJ last December at Kinshasa. The resolutions of principle adopted there contain positive and fruitful elements. In the same context of reformulating regional development strategy  the fourth meeting of the Conference of Ministers held during the thirteenth session of the ECA was also held in Kinshasa  and the conclusions reached with regard to inter-African co-operation warrant special attention on our part because they constitute important factors for our States  concerned as they are to establish collective economic security. In the same way  the conclusions of the First Conference of Heads of State and Government if the OAU and the League of Arab States  held in Cairo in March  constitute  in our view  a potentially encouraging and optimistic factor. At the present stage  this last development  although modest  is probably as promising as any of the other attempts at dialogue in which a clear conflict of interests holds sway over a natural sense of justice and equity.228.	Those are the views of my delegation on the present situation of the international economy. On the basis of the intentions expressed repeatedly in both subregional and regional forums and in the United Nations system  we must seek ways and means of changing people's thinking and giving expressed intentions a real impetus towards realization.229.	There are some questions which  because they have a social and economic impact on the future of the developing nations  are matters of constant concern for my country.230.	I would refer  first of all  to the problem of desertification. The first world conference on this topic has just been held at Nairobi. This is encouraging proof of the universal awareness of the various problems which are constantly posed by a natural phenomenon  and the plan of action adopted by that Conference  which is the fruit of three years of thinking and research  could undoubtedly constitute an effective tool if the sacrifices needed for its implementation were widely accepted. Quite apart from the dispute about the institution of a fund  we should like to express our sincere hope that  as in the case of the voluntary assistance which was so promptly provided  the international community would react very favourably to the establishment of permanent machinery to fight desertification. The campaign against desertification is  above all  an ecological campaign; the two go hand-in-hand.231.	The second question of concern to my Government arises out of the problems met with in the reconciling of views on the very complex and fundamental question of the law of the sea. While the informal single negotiating text agreed on at the sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea makes unanimity possible with regard to the principle of the right of access to the sea and from the sea  the no-less-important aspects of the definition of the boundaries of exclusive sovereignty  and the international body for the exploitation and exploration of the sea-bed are still the subject of rigid and irreconcilable attitudes which make any negotiated solution seem a very faint prospect.232.	My country  because of its deeply land-locked situation  and still suffering from the painful experience of long years of destructive drought  intends to work  together with the nations that share its concern  for a lasting and agreed solution  at the regional level and at the world level  for the economic difficulties which we suffer because of our distance from the sea and our situation at the heart of the Sahel region. With regard to these questions  joint actions are being undertaken at various levels  especially in the framework of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  the Club des amis du Sahel  the West African Economic Community of the States ofWest Africa and the Cultural and Technical Co-operation Agency  and certain of their projects with regard to accessibility and the struggle against desertification  undertaken with the help of certain friendly countries  arouse immense hopes on our part. I should like to take this timely opportunity to express again  on behalf of the Government and peoples of Niger  our feelings of gratitude to the Government and people of Canada for the historic decision they took at the recent ministerial meeting of the Permanent Inter-State Committee to alleviate the external debt burden of the least developed of the developing countries members of the United Nations. By thus conceding one of the major claims of the developing countries at the Paris Conference  the Canadian Government has acted as an exemplary and effective pioneer for the new economic order which we desire with all our hearts. This is an unprecedented step in the improvement of the multilateral co-operation machinery and we hope that this attitude will inspire other wealthy countries to relieve the poor countries of the globe of the weight of certain debts contracted through force of circumstances which greatly hamper their fight against under-development.233.	It is also with true satisfaction that we have taken note of the announcement made by the Foreign Minister of Canada  Mr. Jamieson of the decision of his Government to participate to the extent of 10 per cent in the emergency grain reserve  estimated at 500 000 ions to cover the food deficit for the next 5 or 10 years. This measure is highly welcome to us  because the natural factors that caused the drought are still present in the Sahelian situation.234.	The period since the last session  although relatively short in the life of the nations that we represent  has borne witness  through many regrettable facts and events  to the flagrant and discouraging conflicts which divide the actors in contemporary international life. We continue to deplore the fact that the world in which we live is still confronted with serious problems which open the way to  and all too often result in  a break-down of international peace and security. These two ideals  fundamental in the minds of the authors of the Charter  are the final goal of all our actions in this Organization. Thus it is with unspeakable regret that we witness the numerous cases of massive and often deliberate violations of our Charter and its principles. Whether it be a question of the numerous violations of the sovereignty and integrity of States  flagrant violations of human rights^ or the terrible race to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction  we will not cease to urge this Assembly to assume its full  responsibilities and find the just solutions which these situations require.235.	Only a few years ago Africa was united and determined to throw off the stifling chains of an obsolete colonialism. Today the same Africa is witnessing the most horrible fratricidal confrontations in its history. Sister and neighbouring nations  united not only by history and geography  but also by striking natural ethnological  linguistic and cultural similarities  are fighting each other in a confrontation in which there can be no victor. The subtle game of the colonialists  which divided us in order more easily to conquer us  has now been taken over by independent and sovereign nations as their own. The principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the OAU  reaffirmed in various decisions  resolutions and statements designed to consolidate and strengthen peace and security  good-neighbourliness and fraternal co-operation among the peoples and nations of the globe  are increasingly trampled underfoot and crushed  pitifully showing us up as irresponsible and unworthy. We deliberately agree to play the game of the imperialists who set us against each other for their own ends.236.	In the opinion of my delegation it is urgently necessary that the present requirements concerning human rights  fundamental and legitimate as they are  take account of the indispensable pre-condition of their attainment: respect for the sovereign right of nations and organized human societies  respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and their right to lead in their own countries a life in conformity with their aspirations.237.	These are the prophetic words of Lieutenant-Colonel Seyni Kountche  President of the Supreme Military Council and Chief of State:""Africa has become the pawn of the great Powers. It is  so to speak  the chosen ground for all kinds of military manoeuvres. It is imperative that we prevent its being transformed into an immense battlefield to which the richest will come to drop their surplus bombs on the innocent heads of our already deprived peoples.""These prophetic words are being translated today into bitter reality  the backlash of that which we have denounced as the greatest scandal of our time-namely  the unbridled arms race. It is inadmissible that certain great Powers should continue to arm themselves and to arm further some small nations which are devoted to peace and tranquillity  thus disturbing the fragile balance of a divided world. How  in the present circumstances  can the so-called civilized nations of the world be understood? While three quarters of mankind are illiterate and hungry  these nations are prepared to display their technology in the form of weapons and other deadly machines from which they gain tremendous profits. Some have put forward a figure of $360 billion  which is the sum necessary to rebuild the economy of a large part of Africa.238.	Peace and security are not the private preserve of anybody. They are necessary for all  great and small countries alike. They are a necessity in the African context  a necessity in the context of all the struggling peoples in all the dominated  exploited and enslaved nations; they are a necessity also in the context of blocs. It is appropriate for me to say here with how much hope we await the results of our next special session on disarmament because in the opinion of Niger the detente so dear to some and the development which is always a priority for others cannot be pursued and consolidated if every day a few more weapons are unloaded on the international market.239.	The hotbeds of confrontation proliferate  crystallizing daily the subjects of our concern. Thus on Cyprus we continue to deplore the events which have led to the division of that island in which the two communities  despite what separates them  must remain open to dialogue and reconciliation. My delegation joins its voice to others in appealing anew to the representatives of the two communities to resume negotiations in a constructive manner  under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  on the basis of a mutually acceptable compromise in accordance with the aspirations of the Cypriot nation.240.	In the Middle East the Zionist enemy continues its acts of barbarous and criminal aggression against the Palestinian people  which is trying to regain its usurped homeland. Israel is stubbornly extending its occupation of Arab territories despite Security Council resolution 338(1973} and subsequent decisions of our Organization. We remain firmly convinced that only the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories occupied since June 1967  including Jerusalem  and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State can lead to the establishment of lasting peace in that region. In this connexion we continue to hope that the obstacles raised to the participation of the Palestinians in the Geneva negotiations will be overcome and that that Conference will resume its work on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.241.	My delegation welcomes the new Soviet-United States position on this question as contained in the statement of 1 October 1977. The joint statement signed by the two Governments constitutes a helpful step towards the establishment of true peace in the Middle East. Let us hope that the agreement reached by the two parties will lead to a definitive solution.242.	Turning now to southern Africa  that part of our continent which is still under colonial domination  we are happy to see the interest in its total and definitive liberation demonstrated daily by the international community.243.	The Western countries which  like it or not  were responsible for the birth  the evolution and the economic and technological strength of South Africa and which are becoming increasingly aware of their responsibility  have recently undertaken to try to make Vorster and his clique see reason. Let us hope that their effort is will achieve speedy success so that racism and apartheid disappear for ever from our continent. But we are familiar with the stubbornness of the bastion of racism and also of the complicity which  under cover of multinational corporations  continues skilfully to circumvent the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. The international community can no longer content itself with groans of despair in the face of the principal actors in these tragedies through which the black African has to live through. It must adopt specific sanctions against all States which encourage Vorster and Smith. We are all aware of the anachronism of these practices. Yet  alas  there are the African children who died at Soweto; Steven Biko  who  though he was an apostle of coexistence and non-violence  died recently  like many of his compatriots  a victim of blindness and stupidity.244.	The tribute to be paid is still very heavy. However  we are absolutely convinced that Africa will recover its dignity. We still hope that the recent Anglo-American initiatives and the efforts of the five Powers with regard to the Namibian affair will provide a serious basis for the solution of the problem of southern Africa.245.. Before concluding  I should like to say how much hope and confidence the non-self-governing nations and the free world—namely  all mankind—place in the concerted action of our Organization. For its part  Niger continues to believe that something is possible not only in the realm of intentions but above all in that of action. The essential reasons-and there is no need to recall them here-which influenced the creation of the United Nations  its evolution and the ever more imperative necessity for its existence and consolidation make it necessary to ensure that the Organization is able courageously and consistently to shoulder its historic responsibility concerning the serious questions which face the international community.246.	We understand this responsibility to be that of ensuring increasing rationalization of the administrative machinery  a more efficient co-ordination among the organs and institutions of the system and a greater willingness to implement the decisions taken in conformity with the wishes of the sovereign nations which we represent.247.	The sad fate of the League of Nations today threatens the United Nations  but we sincerely hope that it will be in no way deflected by the many and often deliberate obstacles which face it. We must set aside the unfortunate and inefficient practice of making majestic but idle declarations  the proliferation of repetitive resolutions and recommendations which are never implemented—in a word  we nr it set aside everything that diverts us from our own will and the compelling reasons which cause us to meet here each year for three months  for the United Nations is and will long remain the last resort of parliamentary diplomacy.248.	At the end of my statement  I should like again to turn to my African compatriots to deplore with them the acute crises  the wars and hatred which have come to our continent through a wide-open door. Our collective security is being put to the test.249.	Our generation  often tempted by ideologies which are extremely difficult to reconcile with our traditions of tolerance and freedom  runs the risk of bearing for some time to come the responsibility for these untimely imports. The great n?: are no longer making war against each other except dough intermediaries. Why should we then accept to sacrifice our peoples at the service of interests which are totally alien to them?250.	Furthermore  nationalism  which the whole world cherishes because of its noble role in the building of a just and equitable society  is often robbed of its true nature in Africa. It has become the catch-all to justify crimes  genocide and the greed of power and domination.251.	Africa needs to recover its virtues of tolerance and justice; needs that for the genuine struggle which is coming—that of recovering its dignity  that of its development. There is no such thing as an insoluble problem. Our meetings in the OAU are often an example of political goodwill in the direction of reconciliation and understanding. It must be admitted that there does not exist among us countries or men whose role it is to lead others towards any kind of destiny. Our rules  however weak they may be  our chances at a common life with its everyday uncertainties  the benefit of progress for our peoples  are contained in various charters  the best of which is that of the OAU. Those who for one reason or another think they can do without the OAU and its principles also know the risk they are running. All countries have a common and necessary need for group solidarity. No country has succeeded in building its power on external forces in order to impose it on other African States. Let us remain united and let us nurture for more useful struggles in favour of our peoples  our feelings of sincere nationalists and our generous efforts for a better and united Africa.252.	In conclusion  I should like  Mr. President  to offer you my sincere congratulations on your election and on the skilful manner in which you have so far conducted our debates. "
"92",5086,"NGA",32,1977,"﻿106. It is a great honour and privilege for me to be here today to address this assembly of world nations. As numerous representatives and other well-wishers have already done before me  I wish  in the name of the Nigerian Government and people  to convey our heartfelt congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. In view of the length of the agenda  as well as the complexity of the issues before us at this session  we have no doubt that you will have to draw generously upon all those qualities of statesmanship which have marked you out for this unique recognition. In considering also the universally acknowledged position of Yugoslavia as a bastion of the non- aligned concept and your personal calibre as a statesman  we are confident that you will acquit yourself most creditably in the discharge of your onerous duties.107.	I should like to convey the greetings of the Nigerian Government and people to this Assembly and  in particular  their best wishes for a successful session. This is not simply one more routine annual session of the United Nations General Assembly  but rather one that must rededicate itself anew to those noble principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter and  in particular  to those that express the hope of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war  of maintaining international peace and security  of developing friendly relations among States on the basis of equality of sovereignty  and of devising a way to solve existing disputes by peaceful means. It is against that background and in that spirit that we ardently hope that the current session will pursue its task over the next two months. We pledge the full co-operation of the Nigerian delegation in the fulfilment of those objectives in the over-all interests of world peace  justice and security.108.	It might perhaps be pertinent to recall here that the world of 1977 is a far cry from those eventful days of the immediate post-war period of 1945  when the world  freshly emerged from the nightmare of a carnage unprecedented in human history  ardently desired and sought ways and means to prevent a recurrence of global war. On two occasions within this century mankind indulged in colossal and barbaric destruction of human life and property  only to discover at the end that the interrelationships of peoples must be based on justice  and that any other approach to the interaction of men and nations will sooner or later result in violence and tragedy for mankind.109.	A substantial part of what has now come to be known as the ""third world"" was then completely unconcerned with the ideological issues or the historical events that led to the two wars. In the process of the evolution of colonial history after 1945  a different type of struggle on a global scale ensued. During that period only a minority of the nations now represented here today were considered capable of exercising the sovereign attributes that determined the course of human history over the next decade- and-a-half  until the irrepressible cause of human freedom eventually triumphed in the early 1960s  and the erstwhile colonial peoples took their rightful place within this august assembly of nations.110.	The entire continent of Africa was represented at the historic United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco by three independent States; and that was  moreover  the total African participation in the ceremony of signing the original United Nations Charter by the founding nations  three out of a grand total of 51 Member States.111.	But the world has changed since then  and African States now constitute nearly one third of this prestigious Organization. Besides  if one considers the inherent imperfection of all human institutions  and the self-evident fact that all man-made institutions are subject to change  it seems quite clear that the newly independent nations of the third world in general  and of Africa in particular  are now grossly under-represented in practically all the major organs of the United Nations. Our struggles for a review of the relevant provisions of the Charter that would lead to a more equitable representation of nations on the basis of present- day realities will continue unabated  and we are confident that  given the necessary political will on all sides  this objective can be achieved.112.	But Africa's struggles  and the struggles of the entire third world  go far beyond the cause of equitable representation within United Nations organs. They transcend the limited objectives of the United Nations Charter  touching as they do on the very foundations of justice and human freedom. Since its inception the idea of the United Nations and its system have been continuously subjected to intellectual and physical attack from all quarters and shades of opinion in spite of the self-evident nature of the superiority of justice over injustice  of peace over violence  and of freedom over bondage.113.	At this point I should like to refer to the cause of decolonization and the eradication of racism from those parts of Africa that are still labouring under the oppressive rule of colonialism and of intransigent minority regimes.114.	In Zimbabwe alone we have witnessed with dismay the strange phenomenon  unprecedented in recent colonial history  of a minority white regime in rebellion against the colonizing Power  and getting away with it for 12 years despite all the efforts to persuade the administering Power to acknowledge and discharge its obligations to the 6 million indigenous people  who continue to be denied their basic human rights in defiance of the Charter of our Organization. All our appeals have been met with half-hearted measures  and the invention of superficial economic sanctions that are full of loop-holes. Today  therefore  the racist regime in rebellion can still boast that the white minority has a more viable economy and enjoys a higher standard of living. But it still has to contend with the unwavering dedication  patriotism and grim determination of the nationalist liberation movements. The nationalists and freedom fighters will continue to stand ready to pay the supreme sacrifice rather than live ignominiously in perpetual bondage. Their cause is just  and their struggles sacred. Their sacrifices will not be in vain  because time is on their side and Africa stands by them  and they enjoy the full solidarity of all freedom-loving peoples throughout the world. In this regard it is necessary to emphasize once again that the Nigerian Government and people are totally committed to the cause of freedom and justice in that part of our continent. This we consider as a duty that must be performed  and we are determined to restore the honour and dignity that belong to that continent and to all its inhabitants  at whatever cost.115.	I must also place on record here once again the appreciation of the Nigerian Government and people for the laudable role which the United Nations has played in the past  and has continued to play  so that even in southern Africa the basic right of man to freedom may be quickly restored. The United Nations archives are rich and overflowing with resolutions about ending the illegal regime in Rhodesia so that a free Zimbabwe may be born. The good intentions behind most of these resolutions have never been in doubt  and we would probably have achieved a positive result by now but for the combination of open support of the illegal regime by their fellow racists of South Africa and the clandestine support or tacit sabotage by those who profess to believe in democracy at home but prefer to espouse the cause of fascism in Africa.116.	It is equally important that we mention in this regard the current proposals jointly made by the United Kingdom and the United States of America for a peaceful settlement in Rhodesia  otherwise known as the Anglo-American proposals  and recently made public in broad outline form. We have given very careful and exhaustive consideration to these proposals  and our view is that  in spite of obvious defects and weakness  mostly of an ambiguous nature  the proposals may well deserve to be given a chance. In working out the detailed implementation of these proposals these defects and weaknesses must be removed. For this reason among others  we have supported the steps taken by the Security Council to authorize the Secretary-General to appoint a representative in Rhodesia as required in these proposals. We note with satisfaction the expeditious steps taken so far.117.	Having said this  however  I consider it imperative to sound a note of warning that Nigeria will never be party to any solution in Zimbabwe that could be remotely interpreted as a sell-out of the 6 million people of that land. Our objective is  unequivocally  a surrender of power by the minority to the majority of the population. We have  therefore  naturally condemned all manoeuvres  such as the frantic search by the rebel regime for a so-called international settlement  as totally unacceptable.118.	And finally on this point  we should like to record warm tributes to the constructive role that the independent States adjacent to Rhodesia  otherwise known as the front-line States  have continued to play in the search for a solution there  by peaceful negotiations if possible  and through the barrels of guns if necessary.119.	The former League of Nations Trust Territory of South West Africa  now Namibia under United Nations administration but still illegally occupied by the Vorster regime of South Africa  is one other area of our continent with which we are profoundly preoccupied. We believe  too  that the United Nations is equally preoccupied with events within the Territory on account of the special responsibility imposed on us for the suffering people of Namibia by the termination of South Africa's Mandate over the Territory  which has been so grossly abused. We are greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm which the Secretary-General has shown in his efforts to reassert United Nations control over the Territory and we can only hope that these efforts  in combination with the current dialogue by some Member States with the Vorster regime  will persuade the racists of South Africa of the utter futility of trying to stem the tide of freedom in southern Africa. We salute the leaders of SWAPO and-pay warm tributes to the devotion of that Organization and its determination to free Namibia from illegal occupation. We wish to assure this Assembly that we in Nigeria will not relax our efforts to see Namibia free. We look forward therefore to welcoming Namibia here next year to the comity of sovereign and independent nations.120.	African liberation efforts will  of course  never be complete until the 18 million non-white people inside South Africa itself are free from the clutches of the minority racist regime. This case of man's inhumanity to man that continues to be perpetuated in South Africa is unparalleled within any other civilized society of modern times. In the context of apartheid the black man is considered subhuman  and he has been subjected to all forms of indignity in his own land—in order  we are told paradoxically  to defend Christendom and Western civilization. While the events in Sharpeville remain fresh in our minds  we are living witnesses to indescribable horrors perpetrated against innocent and defenceless youth and students in Soweto and other segregated areas of black concentration in South Africa. But the youths of Soweto have proved beyond any doubt—if anyone ever doubted— that a people's yearnings for freedom and human dignity cannot be suppressed by force of arms or by sheer intimidation. We have seen Hitler fall  and the history books are replete with accounts of the fall of similar dictators. We are firmly determined  therefore  that the case of Vorster's totalitarian regime in South Africa shall not prove an exception.121.	The South African regime  of course  has been turned into a military power in Africa by those who would rather secure the economic and so-called strategic advantages of the Cape than consider the more legitimate yearnings of an oppressed people for justice and human dignity. At the recent World Conference for Action against Apartheid  which Nigeria had the honour and privilege of arranging in collaboration with the United Nations  we served notice to all such double-dealers  and in particular to the multinational companies  that they would have to decide to choose between our hospitality and their adventurism by which they prop up the oppressive regime in South Africa. This is a solemn undertaking of the Nigerian Government and I should like to repeat here that we have established an economic intelligence unit which will provide necessary information and recommend action against such collaborators with the racist regimes  who at the same time avail themselves of the hospitality and magnanimity of our people and the benefits of our economy.122.	If I have dwelt at such length in my statement on the question of freedom and human dignity in southern Africa it is because this issue occupies a central and unique position in the Nigerian Government's policies. But this is not to say that we are not concerned with such other pressing international issues as disarmament  the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  the creation of a new and more equitable world economic order  the so-called North-South dialogue and the interplay of great Power rivalries in Africa and the Middle East.123.	We have noted with satisfaction that steps are being taken to convene sometime in the coming year a special session of this Assembly on the vexed and seemingly intractable problem of disarmament  a solution to which  although urgent  has proved so elusive for us all these many years past. I note with particular satisfaction in this regard that Nigeria has the honour of participating in the preparatory work  and we look forward anxiously to a positive outcome at both the special session and the world conference that might eventually follow.124.	The reasons for our anxiety over the question of disarmament and our serious concern in this regard derive  of course  from the recognition that if the unbridled race in the production of weapons of mass destruction and mutual annihilation between the super-Powers were to continue at the present pace we should be faced with the near certainty of a third world war  with all the attendant tragedy and human suffering that it would imply. In the eventuality of a nuclear holocaust there would probably be no victors  and the human race as a whole would be the loser since the generalized destruction that would result would obviously recognize no political barriers. We hope  therefore  that the gravity of the threat posed to world peace and security is equally well recognized by the super-Powers and that the time will soon come when the valuable resources at present devoted to such a dangerous pursuit will be more fruitfully deployed for the greatest good of the greatest section of mankind.125.	In this regard I am encouraged by the growing detente among the super-Powers. Such co-operation in technological  economic and other fields is the surest way to develop mutual confidence through interdependence  to lead to less tension  and to encourage disarmament.126.	The same remarks are equally applicable to the noble intentions that inspired the signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is also essential to add here a note of caution: while we of the third world fully appreciate the wise objectives behind this Treaty we shall not sit down as helpless onlookers while the means of nuclear technology are being tacitly transferred to delinquent and racist enemies in South Africa. We condemn such collaboration with the apartheid regime  from whatever quarter  as strongly as We are determined that the rest of Africa shall not be found a sitting duck for racist aggression if and when such an eventuality should ever arise.127.	It is our ardent hope and desire that Africa shall remain a nuclear-free zone  provided of course that this hope is not rendered naive by the merchants of horror and the enemies of humanity.128.	I believe it is hardly necessary to repeat here again that the vast majority of our nations in the third world have chosen the path of non-alignment as a philosophy in the conduct of our foreign policy. This means  in essence  that we welcome the friendship and co-operation of all the nations on the basis of mutual respect and complete sovereign equality. We therefore have the greatest pleasure to welcome the assumption by the heroic Republic of Viet Nam of its rightful place in this assembly of nations.129.	I commenced this address by referring to the Objective of our Organization  as enshrined in the Charter  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In our view  this must be interpreted to include also the urgent need for peace  human rights and human dignity  all of which are inextricably tied up to tile restoration of economic justice and the establishment of a more equitable world economic order  Here again  it is our view that the fortunes of all nations in the modern world are totally interdependent; that  were the present economic inequalities between the rich and poor nations to continue unchecked  we would be facing a bleak future; and that ultimate prospects under these conditions could hardly be less menacing than those of a nuclear war. It is for this reason that we welcome the apparent commitment of the North-South dialogue to find a more equitable order that would end  once and for all  our present division into ""haves"" and ""have-nots"". We should all hope and pray that the United Nations will continue its present admirable role in this regard  particularly with regard to raising the living standards of those millions of people in the under Developed nations of the world who are still living precariously below the subsistence level.130.	We in Africa are profoundly concerned about the tussle for areas of political and military influence by the great Powers on our continent  which have tended to deny us the right and ability to settle purely internal African problems in the African way. Examples of foreign intervention at present exist in large numbers in that easily destabilized continent  and I need not mention any specific cases here.131.	I do wish to mention  however  the case of the equally uncertain prospects for peace in the Middle East where the State of Israel has doggedly held on to Arab lands conquered by force of arms. Nigeria is unequivocally opposed to any expansionist policy by any one State against the territory of another  and we have therefore given full support to the deprived Arabs in their efforts to recover their territorial integrity. This we shall continue to do until Israel vacates every inch of the territory it acquired by force of arms and until the world has duly recognized that the Palestinians  too  are entitled to a homeland of their own  in exercise of their right of self-determination.132.	In conclusion  may I say once again how greatly I value and appreciate this unique opportunity to participate in the work of the current thirty-second session of the General Assembly of our great Organization  and to share with you our thoughts on some of the various burning issues on your agenda."
"93",5132,"NIC",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  it is a great pleasure for me  on behalf of my country and on my own behalf  to congratulate you most sincerely on the excellent decision made in electing you to preside over the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your merits and experience ensure for our debates an expert guidance which will contribute to their success.2.	I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the head of the delegation of Sri Lanka  for his excellent work as President of the thirty-first session. I also wish to salute Mr. Kurt Waldheim and to congratulate him on behalf of my country on being re-elected Secretary-General of our Organization. During the first year of his new term of office he has discharged effectively the duties imposed on him by his august office in a manner which has reflected his ability  his dignity and his work for world peace. This  together with his long experience in the international sphere  will enable us to carry out more easily the difficult tasks which no doubt will face us in the future.3.	This year we welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  Their presence among us brings us closer to the fall application of the cardinal principle of universality for our Organization.4.	In my statement to this Assembly last year I expressed cautious optimism on the question of international peace and security  and some of the events that have occurred since then have confirmed that attitude.5.	The progress achieved in regularizing the situation in Lebanon deserves particular mention. The factors involved led us to fear an extension of the conflict  and its confinement has clearly revealed the existence of a spirit of international responsibility  which all the nations here must welcome.6.	The general situation in the Middle East shows signs of improvement. We hope that in due course the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East will be reconvened and that it will lead to agreements satisfactory to all the parties and will establish a permanent peace that  will enable the peoples concerned to resume ;he course of their development.7.	While paying a well-deserved tribute to the late President of the Republic of Cyprus  Archbishop Makarios  my Government notes the stagnation in the situation in that country. The resolutions of the General Assembly do not appear to have given effective guidelines for the solution of that dangerous situation. A new effort should be made in the light of the additional factors that might be brought out in a more open and direct discussion of the problem among the parties directly concerned.8.	We cannot fail to be concerned at the rising tensions among the great Powers. The risks of a direct confrontation between then are less than in the .past; nevertheless  a rise in those tensions has an adverse effect in the countries that are politically at the periphery  and our peripheral societies are inevitably victims of the tension.9.	Nor can we fail to mention the warlike actions and the profound political disturbances on the African continent. Once more we have seen the direct effects of foreign intervention  which render the solution of conflicts more difficult because it introduces elements which do take account not of the interests of the countries primarily involved but rather of the neo-colonialist strategies and long-term interests of the countries that carry out the intervention.10.	It is our hope that the African continent will develop politically and economically. That will  however  be difficult if foreign intervention persists. We would wish the path to that progress to be freely chosen by the will of the Africans and not imposed on them from outside. We once again energetically condemn intervention as contrary to the principles that should govern relations among peoples.11.	My country was very pleased to note the signing of the treaties on the Panama Canal. We consider that to be an event of far-reaching historical implications that will favourably affect future relations between the United States and Latin America  which has always been in solidarity with Panama concerning its claim to complete sovereignty over its entire territory. 12.	Closely linked to the tensions and interests of the great Powers  the arms race has received a new impetus which is turning disarmament into a meaningless concept. We deem it immoral for the great Powers to spend vast sums on arms to deal with situations they have themselves created. The policy of dangerous consumption that the constant preparation and replacement of arms by the great Powers represents transfers a substantial part of their costs to our economies and uses up resources that could better be used in raising the standard of living of mankind.13.	Traditionally the promotion of international peace  the prohibition of war as a political instrument  the creation of zones set aside by law for peaceful uses and the gradual building of legal barriers to curb the arms race and the destruction caused by war have been an integral part of Latin American policy. In this connexion the legal history of Latin America has been markedly linked with the establishment of a more harmonious international order; to the devotion .to peaceful purposes of outer space  the Antarctic  the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction; and to the establishment of a larger number of denuclearized zones  the first of which was located in our own central and South American continent.14.	The Government of my country finds no justification for separating the foreign policy of the nation of Nicaragua from thos.3 principles and aims of the Latin American region. On the contrary  we consider that if any deviation is observed  every effort should be exerted to keep our continent on a course ever further from the use of force and more within the framework of law. In this respect we welcomed the recent signing by the United States of America of Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Hatelolco). We are also pleased to observe the growing number of States which condemn the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction.15.	Accordingly  at the present session we shall support efforts intended to promote an international policy basedincreasingly on peaceful relations among States and including the establishment of more zones of peace and the prohibition of nuclear weapons  treaties designed to achieve the complete prohibition of nuclear and thermonuclear tests  to prohibit the development of new weapons of mass destruction or to impose growing restrictions on the development of the capacity.16.	For five years now the General Assembly has had before it an item on international terrorism. Certainly  the results achieved so far have been minimal. Meanwhile  terrorist crimes are on the increase. The number of innocent victims rises while our Organization cannot reach an agreement on the adoption of concrete and specific measures for the prevention and suppression of such acts. We believe in the value of human life  and we consider there can be no political or ideological justification for the destruction of human life.17.	Last year the Federal Republic of Germany presented to the General Assembly for its consideration a proposed item concerning the drafting of an international convention against the taking of hostages  one of the acts of terrorismmost repugnant to world conscience. My country supported that proposal and was one of the members of the Ad Hoc Committee responsible for drafting the convention  which met during the month of August of this year. No substantive result was achieved at those meetings  and we therefore request that the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee be renewed and that it be invited to continue its work in the years to come.18.	Two months ago  the sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea came to a close. In our statement of last year we expressed our trust that the sixth session would achieve the reconciliation of opposing positions and would formulate the rules for a new law of the sea that would be more just and equitable than that which has governed us traditionally. That trust was disappointed  and all we have from the sixth session is an integrated text drafted by the President which is far from having obtained the necessary consensus. Some Powers have come to consider that the sixth session was not only not an advance towards a solution but  rather  a step back.19.	We deem the situation very grave  and we believe that before the next session  scheduled for next year  every effort must be made to arrive at a unified approach. In negotiations  no one can try to impose all his points of view. Conciliation must be sought so as to bring positions closer. In particular  we should like to point out that those countries must not yield to the temptation of losing patience and taking unilateral measures on matters which are still the subject of the debate. Such a course of action would make it far more difficult to arrive at a consensus and would greatly jeopardize good relations among States.20.	Out of profound conviction Nicaragua advocates strict respect for human rights and international action to promote them. We believe that this respect for and promotion of human rights  as enshrined in the constitutional Charter of our Organization  is one of its basic purposes and is an unavoidable responsibility of Member States.21.	We believe that the promotion of human rights must be undertaken at the universal level  without any attempt thereby to gain any political advantage. Otherwise  a noble cause would lose its meaning and be robbed of its ethical and moral basis. In particular  we attach great importance to the effective elimination of racial discrimination and of the exaggerated economic imbalances which create what is really de facto segregation. Such discrimination and segregation must be totally eliminated.22.	However  the fact that some States claim that they strictly and fully observe human rights does not entitle them to set themselves up as judges of other countries  arrogating to themselves a function which nobody has conferred on them and which is contrary to the principles of non-intervention and of the legal equality of States.23.	Last week the Government of Nicaragua declared that the exercise of all constitutional guarantees was fully restored. They had been suspended when a plot was discovered against the internal security of the country  a plot reflected in terrorist acts which were repudiated by the Nicaraguan people. The authorities  with the effective co-operation of our citizens  defended the peace in order to safeguard the political  social and economic stability of the democratic system of my Government.24.	One of the. spheres of action in which the United Nations system has proved most valuable and effective has been in economic matters. The fundamental reason for its success is probably that in matters of this kind the institutional method of co-operation and negotiation has been adopted. Situations of international crisis have arisen largely when States have departed from that institutional method and instead adopted methods involving confrontation and undue interference in the affairs of others.25.	It should be noted  purely by way of contrast  that in the political and social fields encompassed within the United Nations system  on the other hand  the method followed has not always been that of co-operation and negotiation; instead there has been a tendency to resort more to procedures of confrontation and undue interference in the internal affairs of other countries. As a consequence  there have been clear cases of friction and tension between the system and some Member States  cases which could have been avoided if a different institutional method had been used. It is to be hoped that in the future prudence will lead us to avoid establishing organs or departments on setting up agencies except under express terms of reference with strict rules of co-operation and collaboration with Member States.26.	The Government of my country has carefully followed the North-South dialogue. We are convinced that those negotiations should continue on the basis of joint consideration of the problems which are of vital importance for the development of our countries and for the development of a more equitable and efficient world economy.27.	It is natural for every country to follow the development of events in the economic field in the light of what concerns its own situation and for each country to try to obtain in the end the best possible position within an order in which there is keen competition. We must point out  however  that the limit of competition is the common interest  and once that limit is exceeded there can be no impunity for anyone. Accordingly  the developing countries should continue to intensify their co-operation and should not seek solutions which  while appearing to be general solutions  in fact have the effect of benefiting some developing countries at the expense of others.28.	That is a situation that might easily arise in the negotiations on the problems of external indebtedness. We believe there is a broad scope for exploring an increase in official development assistance  improving the terms of trade  and transferring real resources from the developed to the developing sector  before taking measures that might lead to a higher cost of capital servicing in the future  a measure which  while giving merely a short breathing-space to countries affected by the high costs of debt servicing  would only help to increase the advantages already enjoyed by countries with a high level of capital accumulation  without providing a viable and final solution for the problem of capital formation in the developing countries.29.	The year 1977 has demonstrated the continued process of the recovery of the world economy  and particularly the recovery of the most significant of the developed economies. The importance of that recovery is clear for my Government  since we need the highest possible level of international consumption for our goods. However  the most fortunate of the developed countries should not forget that that recovery was possible only at high cost to the developing countries  reflected in higher unemployment and underemployment  and in the greater prevalence of outside factors in the inflationary process.30.	We believe that a reasonable price stability must be the target for the immediate effort of the international economic system. That stability  nevertheless  must not be interpreted as an obligation for the developing countries to maintain the situation of economic injustice to which they have been subjected. On the contrary  our greater importance in international trade should be sufficient reason to encourage all sectors to seek more equity in the benefits of the international economic activities.31.	One of the reasons for the frustration  agitation and anxiety in our developing societies is precisely the fact that the injustice of the international economic order does not allow our Governments to set up a more equitable and just internal distribution system. When references are made to respect for human rights  this external factor  which carries so much weight in internal social and political questions  must not be overlooked. Here it is important to emphasize that to deny to countries that which is due them in justice and equity for the goods they export and to charge excessively high prices for the goods they import is a factor which has a powerful impact on the right to life  to development  to health and to education of the poorer peoples  and is therefore in itself a causal factor of the violation of the fundamental rights of the human being.32.	My Government considers the food problem one of the most urgent for the international community because in itself it is one of the determining factors in the development of the human potential which has the most intimate and immediate impact on the possibilities of achieving that development. Among the national programmes for agricultural and food development  the Government of my country has taken the measures necessary for the discharge of its most immediate responsibilities in this respect by increasing production possibilities  through  among other means  the prevention of climatic disasters such as drought  as well as by maintaining broad access to and participation in the benefits of a greater production and better quality for the largest number of people. Furthermore  to the purely economic structure of the food market  we have added an institutional framework which has enabled us  gradually and continuously  to increase social security and assistance services so as to make available to the economically weaker sectors those services that will provide them with the basic physical conditions indispensable for dignified survival.33.	I am pleased to affirm here that the development of our agriculture and of the food industry in our country has enabled us to continue to use our physical resources rationally to meet national needs; and that this sector of our economy has in percentage terms become the most important sector in context of our regional market.34.	As regards our international policy  we shall continue to lend our support to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We hope it will- start functioning soon so as to exercise a beneficial influence in those countries where the food shortage of the population is most acute.35.	May I avail myself of this opportunity to express the gratitude of the Government of Nicaragua to UNDP for its continued valuable assistance in national plans. It is imperative that it have sufficient financial resources so as not to damage programmes drawn up earlier in reliance on UNDP assistance. We also wish to express our gratitude to UNICEF and to. the World Food Programme for the assistance given us in the past.36.	As a developing country  we are convinced that one of the means of development is economic integration. Hence  we have lent cur full support to the restructuring of the Central American Common Market  and we are ready to study and analyse all the proposals which will lead to this end. Likewise  we have strengthened our links with other developing countries. We know well that co-operation among our countries is necessary and desirable. Since our problems are almost the same  we can better help and understand each other. My country will participate in the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries for the reasons I have mentioned above  and in the hope of strengthening technical assistance  because the orderly transfer of technology in accordance with the needs of our countries is one of the means of accelerating our socio-economic development.37.	Seven years ago this Assembly proclaimed the Second United Nations Development Decade. Half-way through the Decade a review took place. Now we are almost at the end of the period and the goals we set ourselves seven years ago have not yet been met. Many countries  instead of improving their situation  have lagged behind in their development either because of the high price of energy or because of the decline in the prices of their main exploit products which are nearly always primary products. Accordingly  we reiterate the need to establish the new international economic order as proclaimed by this Assembly  and for compliance by all countries with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which filled a gap existing at the United Nations with regard to the international economic situation. Nicaragua is prepared to lend its full support to all efforts made toward a new economic order which will be just and equitable for all countries. 	 	"
"94",5178,"NLD",32,1977,"﻿137.	 This session of the General Assembly opens under circumstances clouded in uncertainty and fraught with persistent dangers to world peace. There is cause for deep concern over the great political and  above all  moral issues of our time. There is doubt about the capacity of the United Nations to meet the challenges it is facing. In this situation the Assembly must praise its luck in having found you  Mr. President  ready to chair this session. The Netherlands Government and people have always admired your country's strong sense of independence. 1 congratulate you most warmly.138.	On behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  I wish to extend a warm welcome to the two new Members of the Organization  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti.139.	In his annual report on the work of the organization  the Secretary-General shows grave concern over the state of the world and of the Organization. Indeed  the positive facts and developments are overshadowed by negative events and situations. Free elections and a return to democracy contrast with increased violations of human rights. Progress in the North-South dialogue and prosperity in some parts of the world are clouded by unemployment and inflation  protectionism  persistent mass poverty and lack of progress in achieving structural change in world economic relations. Progress towards detente in Europe and the absence of war in some regions have to be measured against the dangerous stalemate in the Middle East  growing violence in southern Africa and the increased threat of nuclear proliferation.140.	1 wish to stress the moral implications of the issues which this General Assembly is again called upon to solve. Too often the moral responsibility of the Members of the United Nations tends to be overlooked and neglected in our preoccupation with selfish national interests  and yet there is no higher code of conduct for the nations of this world than the Preamble to the Charter  which contains the basic human values which should guide the behaviour of States and the community of States: collective responsibility for common problems  tolerance  national self-restraint and readiness to compromise  justice and respect for human dignity and individual rights  concern for the poor and oppressed.141.	The same Charter provided instruments  institutions and procedures for co-operation to realize these high values. But can the Organization still cope with today's world? There is a paradox: universality has been virtually obtained  but  at the same time  nations seem to turn away from the Organization by creating parallel structures and by frustrating the very system of co-operation through unwarranted politization. The other side. of the medal is that frustration caused by lack of progress in solving vital issues leads to politization and alternative institutions. It is disquieting that lengthy talks on strengthening the United Nations and on restructuring its economic and social arm have brought us nowhere.142.	It is against this background that I wish to address myself to some of the key issues of today. On a number of these problems the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium has clearly stated the position of the nine members of the European Community: he has stressed the political will of our countries constructively to co-operate towards their solution. In this same spirit I should like to add some remarks on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.143.	In the Middle East  for the first time perhaps since the beginning of the conflict  there is now hope for a genuine peace conference to start working out a lasting settlement. Responsible statesmen of the countries concerned have voiced their desire for peace. Everywhere the conviction is growing that the state of war must come to an end and that the time is ripe at last for devoting the invaluable human and material resources in the region to peaceful development. In this situation  it is of course of vital importance that all Governments concerned should refrain from any statement or policy  in particular with regard to the West Bank  that could constitute an obstacle to this pursuit of peace.144.	The situation in southern Africa is a source of growing anxiety The death of Steven Biko symbolizes the denial of fundamental rights which the black people of South Africa still have to suffer. At the World Conference for Action against Apartheid in Lagos  the deep concern of the Netherlands Government and people was expressed when we advocated a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter and when we pointed to the inevitability of economic measures directed against that country under the same Chapter  should the Government of South Africa refuse to introduce fundamental changes in its society without further delay. We said so last year  but there is hardly any change at all. The Netherlands has for many years applied an embargo on all arms deliveries and has put an end to export-credit guarantees. Further steps are considered  such as the curtailment of new investments.145.	The Lagos Conference has signalled to South Africa more clearly and incisively than ever that the policies of apartheid are totally unacceptable and that their continuation will inevitably have serious consequences. At the same time it has followed a constructive approach by calling in its final declaration on the Government of South Africa to let all people  irrespective of race  colour or creed  including the white minority  participate as equals in determining the destiny of their nation. We fervently hope that South Africa will understand this signal and will respond to the appeal addressed to it by abandoning apartheid before violence takes over.146.	Developments in Namibia and Southern Rhodesia have reached a critical stage. The Netherlands supports the intensified international efforts of the United Nations and of the five Western members of the Security Council to break the stalemate in Namibia and solve the problem on the basis of democratic elections under the supervision of the United Nations so as to enable its people to exercise the right to determine in freedom the destiny of their country. The Netherlands Government strongly endorses the Anglo- American proposals on Southern Rhodesia. 1 urge all the parties concerned to grasp what looks like a last opportunity for peaceful transition to independence through sections on the basis of the principle ""one man  one vote"". The Netherlands is prepared to contribute to a Zimbabwe development fund on condition that such a fund is acceptable to the future Government of a free Zimbabwe elected on the basis of majority rule.147.	One of the most burning moral issues in today's world is the question of human rights. To promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedom is one of the basic objectives of my country's policy. Human rights is more than ever before arousing deep public concern- The Final Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  with its clear obligations in the field of human rights and the policy of the American Administration  are clear evidence of this fact. But there is also the sinister fact that widespread and persistent violation is increasing in many parts of the world. Too often  however  in the United Nations other motives and interests prevail over genuine human rights considerations. The fully legitimate action by the United Nations with regard to a limited number of specific situations is outbalanced by inaction or even total silence in a much larger number of cases that give rise to equal or greater anxiety The United Nations has even failed to act againstthe scourge of terrorism and the taking of hostages. This Assembly must make a determined effort to come to grips with this outrage to everyone and every people.148.	The struggle for human rights comprises not only civil and political rights but equally economic  social and cultural rights. The realization of the totality of those rights is imperative for achieving the full development of the human personality. The promotion of human rights includes the achievement of just social and economic structures; it forms an indispensable element of the development process.149.	However  1 cannot accept the thesis that the observance of fundamental freedoms should be subordinated to the realization of social and economic advancement. Inability to guarantee the enjoyment of one basic right should never serve as a justification for violating another one.150.	The United Nations has a crucial  twofold task in the field of human rights: standard-setting and implementation. The impressive body of humanitarian standards laid down in conventions  declarations and resolutions needs continuous evaluation  elaboration and completion. This session of the General Assembly should work and make further progress on the issue of political prisoners and religious intolerance. Fully in line with the momentum created by International Women's Year  this session should finalize the draft convention on the elimination of discrimination against women. Let me stress in this respect the role of the United Nations in improving the status of women.151.	The task of the United Nations in the field of implementation is difficult and delicate. Under the Charter the United Nations has the power and the duty to create adequate machinery for the protection of human rights. Existing machinery is inadequate and even in danger of being curtailed  but more regrettable is the lack of the political will to pursue human rights. There is a huge gap between theory and practice  between proclaimed standards and actual protection and observance. Bridging this gap is first of all up to Governments and the people themselves  but the United Nations can and must make a strong and effective contribution to this end.152.	This Assembly will again discuss the human rights situation in Chile. If the Government of Chile is sincere in its self-professed concern for human rights it should allow the Allana mission9 to come and see for itself. But continued concern over Chile must not lead us to ignore serious and persistent violations of human rights elsewhere in the world. There also the United Nations should act.153.	I welcome the entry into force of the two United Nations Covenants on Human Rights. My Government will ratify the Covenants as well as the Optional Protocol on the individual right of complaint in the near future. But the procedures for implementation under these instruments represent only a minimum. They do not make it possible to react in an appropriate manner to urgent and serious violations of human rights. The time has come for the9 Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile appointed in conformity with resolution 8 (XXI) of the Commission on Human Rights.United Nations to create the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights who can make inquiries and render good offices and advice in concrete human rights situations. The human rights machinery already available in the United Nations-I refer to the Commission on Human Rights and its Sub-Commission—must in the meantime be strengthened. As of now open or disguised hostility to the cause of human rights prevents these institutions from being fully used. Thus it can happen that the intergovernmental structure of the United Nations sometimes acts as a barrier to the voices of the oppressed being heard. I wish therefore to stress the importance of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of human rights as an indispensable source of information and as a tool for public education and support for the victims of oppression. The Netherlands will  oppose efforts to smother the voice and the rights of these organizations.154.	In economic terms the world is not much better off. The international community continues to be faced with economic and social conditions throughout the world that call for urgent and imaginative action but to which policy responses have so far been inadequate. Governments around the world are faced with painful and difficult policy choices affecting directly the well-being of their citizens. In the industrialized world the fight against inflation and unemployment requires sacrifices in a state of affluence; but  what is worse  in many developing countries recession adds desperate dimensions to already difficult situations.155.	The issue of development and growth is no longer a matter of concern and immediate interest to the third world only. What is at stake today is the future and the management of the world economy as a whole in the interest of both developed and developing countries. In spite of serious efforts the United Nations system has so far proved inadequate to meet in a coherent manner these new  interrelated challenges of development in the third world and the preservation of growth and economic activity in the industrialized world.156.	Whether or not it is called a new international economic order  a fundamental readjustment of international economic relations and national policies is now called for. That is the lesson of the 1970s.157.	In the wake of the sixth and seventh special sessions and other United Nations conferences  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation was another milestone in the North-South dialogue. The results of the Conference were important but limited because it failed to produce a break-through in the- negotiating process and because it failed to recognize the need for structural change. I regret that the resumed thirty-first session could not reach agreement on the evaluation of the Conference and on its follow-up.158.	The immediate task for this session is to revive and intensify the political momentum  to start or pursue serious negotiations on specific issues  and to prepare for the future. To start with  it is a matter of urgent necessity for the Governments of developed and developing countries alike to be united in warding off the ominous forces of trade protectionism and in sustaining the import demand of developing countries by more aid transfers or otherwise. This  in turn  will have a stimulating effect on the economies of the industrialized world.159.	A new  practical  more direct approach is required for the selection of specific issues to be negotiated between those most concerned. I refer to commodities  debts  trade  investments. In these negotiations a differentiation of instruments is needed according to the specific positions and conditions of the developing and developed countries concerned. The negotiations must take the common interest of rich and poor as the essential point of departure. They must be consistent with global strategies and aims already agreed upon.160.	In the meantime  the world community must now start preparations for a new development strategy  for the implementation of a new international economic order in the interest of both developed and developing countries. Such a strategy should contain new elements: urgent attention to meeting basic human needs in developing countries in the context of structural change in developing as well as developed countries; participation of the people  including youth; greater emphasis on the role of women in development; diversification of instruments according to needs and conditions; and also measures and targets for sustaining growth and economic activity in the industrialized world as part of a joint effort for a new global compact for development.161.	In view of the enormous tasks before us  I particularly welcome the launching of the Brandt Commission. This Commission can perform a crucial complementary function and have a catalytic effect on the preparation of a new United Nations development strategy.162.	Among the global problems which can only be solved by a common effort  the energy issue is one of the most urgent. If adequate measures are not taken now  a new and more serious energy crisis in the 1980s is almost inevitable and will affect not only the poorest countries but also the economies of the rich. The United Nations has so far failed to respond to this challenge.163.	The rich countries consume a disproportionate amount of the world energy supply. Accordingly  it is primarily their responsibility to conserve energy  to promote intensified exploration and exploitation of conventional energy sources  and to develop alternative sources. Not nearly enough has been done so far. The Netherlands Government will work in all appropriate forums for active  joint and well-co-ordinated policies in this field.164.	1 wish  however  to sound a word of caution. In my view the energy situation is serious but not so desperate that we should not carefully judge all possibilities for enlarging the supply of energy on the basis of their consequences and side effects. The sense of urgency must not lead us into haste and premature decisions. Much more can be done to achieve higher energy efficiently. A recent conference sponsored by UNITAR has shown that the sources of recoverable fossil fuels are far from being exhausted and that a much higher recovery rate is feasible. There are promising alternative resources of renewable energy if  at least  technological developments in this respect get more support than hitherto. I hope that the preparatory work on a United Nations conference on new and renewable sources of energy will give a strong impetus to our activities in this field. This can be of tremendous benefit for the poorest countries and for all of us. The United Nations can and must play a more active role in matters of energy research and development  and I trust that this General Assembly will support the relevant Economic and Social Council resolution of last summer  its resolution 2119 .165.	Given proper and timely efforts by all concerned  the scope for energy savings and for developing alternative supplies is such that a wise  anticipatory energy policy will make it possible in the long run to balance supply and demand of energy.166.	I see no compelling reason to rush headlong into the development of nuclear energy. A race in nuclear technology  if left unchecked and uncontrolled  could lead to dangerous and undesirable side effects.167.	I wish to draw particular attention to the deadly threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons  which calls for measures without delay. The non-proliferation Treaty and the IAEA safeguards constitute important political restraints. Their political and practical value should not be underestimated. However  new and sophisticated nuclear technologies are being developed which make it easier to cross the threshold of nuclear military capability. Action is necessary in two directions. First of all  the existing system of safeguards and controls must be expanded and strengthened. I would urge that the IAEA studies on the storage of fissionable materials be speeded up and intensified in order to arrive rapidly at an international plutonium storage regime under IAEA auspices. Secondly  we urgently need an inherently safe nuclear fuel cycle which would not contain significant amounts of weapons- usable materials. We must make civilian nuclear technology proliferation-resistant.168.	The Netherlands Government  therefore  warmly welcomes President Carter's proposals for an international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation and will actively participate in the Conference to be held in Washington next month on that subject. It is my fervent hope that this evaluation will result in a truly co-operative effort of suppliers as well as consumers of nuclear material and technology  without discrimination  in order to limit the risks involved in the use of nuclear energy and at the same time to satisfy the basic energy needs of all countries. For this result to be achieved  it is essential that the outcome of the evaluation should not be prejudged in any w -y. The further spread of sensitive technologies which increase the threat of proliferation of nuclear arms must be avoided.169.	The early conclusion of an effective and comprehensive test ban will greatly strengthen the non-proliferation regime and other measures to curtail the nuclear arms race. This raises the position of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. The high expectations with regard to the potential benefit of such explosions have not been fulfilled; in my view the time has come to eliminate the basic inequality between nuclear weapon Powers and non-nuclear weapon Powers in this field. This should be achieved by a comprehensive test ban which would also prohibit nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes by individual nations and under which nuclear Powers would assume the same self-restraints as the non-nuclear Powers. It is time to cut off this dangerous road to both horizontal and vertical proliferation. Here I have also in mind the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. I regret that up till recently these talks have made little progress and may perhaps not lead to agreement before the first interim agreement of 1972 lapses in October. I feel  however  encouraged by the promising developments in the discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the last few days. Curtailing the strategic nuclear arms race is a matter which allows no further delay..170.	It is my fervent hope that the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  to be convened at the initiative of the non-aligned nations  will create the new political impulse to fruitful and effective multilateral disarmament negotiations in which  in our view  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament must play an important role. The special session must give high priority to nuclear disarmament  but it should also tackle the problem of the increasingly dangerous trade in conventional weapons. Whether or not that session will succeed in turning the tide will depend on our common effort and political will.171.	All these pressing problems have in common their deep moral implications. Racial discrimination  terrorism  the torture of prisoners  widespread suppression of human freedom and social injustice have roused the conscience of the world  which will not rest until these immoral practices are banned. It is immoral to have plenty and to continue to let hundreds of millions live in poverty and misery. Our conscience cannot rest when a minority consumes and wastes the bulk of the world's energy resources without caring for the bulk of the world's people. It would be inadmissible by hasty action and short-sightedness to allow the danger of nuclear proliferation to go unchecked.172.	The institutional machinery for dealing with today's manifold problems has been inadequate and  in some cases  altogether lacking. The United Nations has played too passive a role  a role of reacting to  rather than pre-empting  dangerous events. Have Member States lost confidence in the United Nations? And if so  why? I do not believe in Utopia  but I for one am still convinced of the overriding value of the Charter and of the great potential of the Organization.173.	The world problems of today can be solved if Member States have the political determination to make the system work. The seventh special session demonstrated that it can work if States are prepared to bring vital matters before the United Nations for negotiation on the merits of the case and at a high political level. This applies to the General Assembly itself but even more so to the restricted key organs of the United Nations: the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council  which provide"" ample possibilities and instruments for both formal and informal negotiations.174.	I urge Member States to make full use of the International Court of Justice  which has adapted its procedures in order to meet almost any case or dispute between Members in a thorough and expeditious manner.175.	Speaking about international law  1 wish to draw the attention of the Assembly to the initiative of Australia  supported by the Netherlands and other States  to include in the agenda of our session the item ""Review of the multilateral treaty-making process"". This initiative is an example of the many possibilities for innovation and strengthening the United Nations system which Member States under the Charter have at their disposal.176.	Last but not least is the Secretariat  which Dag Hammarskjold so brilliantly described and defended in his address at Oxford University on 30 May 1961 and which is characterized as ""an instrument  additional to the normal diplomatic methods  for active and growing service in the common interest"". The Articles of the Charter are explicit enough. The history of the United Nations has set ample precedent: the Secretary-General and the heads of the specialized agencies have the authority for initiate action and inspiration. I urge them increasingly to use this authority in consultation and interaction with the intergovernmental organs for the common interest of Member States and the Organization.177.	This Organization was created on the morning after the nightmare of the Second World War as a new  more perfect instrument for peace. The Charter remains our most precious guideline for international co-operation. But cooperation does not take place by itself; it must be constantly fostered. Let us be aware of the ever-growing number of problems which can only be solved by international co-operation in common institutions. Time is of the essence. Many problems become more intractable as time goes by. Let us therefore pledge ourselves anew to effective co-operation so that the generation of the year 2000 will be able to give a positive verdict on the efforts of the generation of today. "
"95",5224,"NOR",32,1977,"﻿187.	 Mr. President  my Government would like to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President. Your unanimous election is a tribute to you personally as well as to your country. I pledge the full support of my delegation in your efforts to ensure the successful outcome of this session of the General Assembly.188.	My Government is also impressed by the devoted work of the Secretary-General in the cause of mankind. I want to assure Mr. Waldheim once more that he can count on the support of my country in his efforts to attain the high goals which the world Organisation has set for itself.189.	 The world order of great paradoxes  would seem to be a fitting description of the present world economic system and underlines the need for a new international economic order. The inadequate exploitation of production capacity in the industrialized part of the world stands in sharp contrast to the vast dimensions of need in the poor countries. This idle production capacity  which has also been the cause of widespread unemployment  has resulted in production losses estimated to amount to $250 billion annually. It is a huge amount that defies the imagination. But reduced to facts  this figure represents factories never built  machines never constructed and food which has never been produced.190.	Another such paradox is the large proportion of the production capacity directed towards military purposes. This does nothing to help make the world a safer place to live in. But the annual military expenditure—$350 billion— represents resources more than 20 times as great as a whole year's development aid from the industrialized nations.191.	And this is happening at a time when the world urgently requires all its energy and resources to meet a series of urgent human problems  as stated in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization.192.	The thirty-second session of the General Assembly is faced with a formidable agenda. But  for the reasons I have just mentioned  two matters must take precedence: first  the relations between rich and poor countries as they appear in the efforts to establish a new international economic order  and secondly  the question of disarmament  especially in connexion with the preparations for the United Nations special session on disarmament.193.	The Norwegian Government fully understands the developing countries' impatience at the slow rate of progress towards the new world economic order. It is regrettable that the North-South dialogue has so far yielded such limited results and that the implementation of concrete measures is proceeding so slowly even in areas where agreement has been reached.194.	Although the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation was instrumental in bringing about a wider understanding of North-South problems  it does not represent the definitive break-through for which the developing countries had hoped. We must see to it that the general understanding in principle reached at the conference in Paris is translated into practical action. The present session of the General Assembly will  in our view  be crucial in this respect.195.	The same is true of the forthcoming negotiations in UNCTAD on a common fund for commodities. We hope that the general agreements on a common fund which was reached in Paris will be maintained during the negotiations on the fund's functions and modalities  so that this central organ  representing a further stage in the implementation of an integrated programme for commodities  can now be realized.196.	My Government will work for the adoption at this General Assembly of the necessary decisions to create a new development strategy. Negotiations should be initiated now to cover a wide range of problem areas involving the whole United Nations system. These negotiations should be conducted with a view to convincing Governments of the necessity of entering into binding commitments.197.	In the present situation the industrialized countries should seek to ensure that their own economic problems do not exert a negative influence on the transfer of resources to the developing countries.198.	On our part  we will fulfil our commitment to reach a level of 1 per cent of our gross national product in official development aid in 1978  notwithstanding an unprecedented deficit in our balance of payments.199.	The mutually beneficial character of international development co-operation should be stressed to reinforce popular support for our efforts.200.	Let me give a small but concrete example of what I have in mind. In many  if not most  countries drug addiction is a very serious problem. This goes for my own country too. Norway has reacted positively to Economic and Social Council resolution 2066 (LXII) passed by the Council a short time ago on assistance to programmes aiming at crop replacement in areas where narcotic plants are cultivated. We have recently entered into an agreement with the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control for the financing of a pilot project in a specific area for this purpose. But substantial results can only be achieved through concerted efforts on the part of the wealthy countries. Yet such an effort would simultaneously contribute to solving one of the most urgent problems confronting our own societies.201.	The current economic situation in the Western industrialized countries seems to be putting a brake on their will and their ability to be more forthcoming towards the developing countries. However  the question is whether the opposite reaction would not be the right one: whether making new purchasing power available to the developing countries would not prove to be a stimulus to the entire world economy. The persistent crises in the international economy call for an open-minded appraisal of international economic relations and of the international division of labour. One' result of such an appraisal would most certainly be acknowledgement of the fact that a new world economic order is also clearly in the interests of the wealthy  industrialized countries. Strengthened impulses to economic growth  improved co-ordination of economic policy  and better planning and steering in international economic relations-these are all aspects of a new international economic order which will be to the advantage of all.202.	Another major item on our agenda is the preparation for the special session on disarmament. This special session will  first  be the most representative forum of States ever convened to discuss this matter; secondly  it will focus the world's attention on the dangers of a continued arms race; and thirdly  it should lay down the necessary guidelines and give incentives for genuine progress in the disarmament negotiations. 202  This special session will provide every country with the possibility—and even more the responsibility-of joining in the effort to see real progress in the field of disarmament.203.	Our final goal is general and complete disarmament under effective international control. This goal can only be reached as the result of a long and gradual process. In the meantime we must aim at increased security at a lower level of armaments.204.	The nuclear-weapon States and other States of military importance bear a special responsibility in the field of disarmament. But there are also areas where all of us have both a special responsibility to bear and a special role to play. What I particularly have in mind is the proliferation of nuclear weapons and also the scope and supervision of the international arms trade.205.	If we fail to prevent a steadily increasing number of countries from acquiring production facilities for nuclear weapons  our other endeavours in the disarmament sector will be of little avail. The strengthening of the non-proliferation regime must therefore be given high priority. In this connexion the non-proliferation Treaty is of crucial importance  and intensive efforts must be made to secure universal adherence to it. My Government also hopes that substantial progress regarding a comprehensive test-ban Treaty  as well as a treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons  will be reached before the special session to convene next May. Such agreements  as well as a new agreement on the limitation of strategic arms  would have a beneficial effect on our efforts to achieve a successful outcome of the special session.206.	Another urgent need is for the further strengthening of the international safeguards system. Commercial interests will have to give way to the necessity of avoiding any proliferation of nuclear arms.207.	Furthermore  my Government is deeply concerned at the great increase in international arms transfers. This question ought to be made the subject of a more detailed study  with a view to arriving at international agreements on the limitation of arms transfers. An important practical instrument in this connexion would be to have a United Nations register recording all such arms transfers.208.	Half a dozen of the world's military Powers are together responsible for 90 per cent of the world's arms sales. It would therefore be reasonable to expect these Powers to take the initiative in introducing a more restrictive policy.209.	We have noted with interest President Carter's recent statement on the policy of the United States as regards the sale of arms  as well as his outline of measures to be initiated to limit arms transfers. We also appreciate the President's decision to start discussions with other producers of arms on measures directed towards multilateral initiatives in this direction.210.	We must bear in mind that this decade has been designated both a disarmament decade and a development decade. In our view there is a close relationship between disarmament and development. The Nordic countries have therefore proposed that a more detailed study be carried out  under the auspices of the United Nations  on the subject of how resources now used for armaments can be released for economic and social development. We have noted that this proposal has received support in the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session. But I should like to stress that resources released through disarmament should not be instead of  but in addition to  development assistance from other sources.211.	In reading the annual report of the Secretary- General  we are all left with a rather dismal picture of this world of ours. In spite of the ceaseless efforts of the United Nations  assisted by many of its Member States  areas of conflict remain in the Middle East  in Cyprus  in southern Africa  and in other parts of the world and threaten peace far beyond their own areas.212.	In southern Africa the white minority regimes now find themselves more isolated than ever. We must increase the international pressure on these regimes in order to make it abundantly clear that the many decisions adopted by the United Nations regarding the situation in southern Africa must be observed.213.	The Conferences in Maputo and Lagos  and the declarations of these conferences  represent new and important contributions. In our view  they ought to form a platform for new measures.214.	We consider that a decision by the Security Council to introduce a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa would be an important means of influencing the course of events in that country. For our part  we are also prepared to support internationally binding measures of economic boycott against South Africa. Through such measures  the international community could effectively demonstrate its solidarity with the people of southern Africa in their struggle against the system of apartheid.215.	Experience has shown that it is difficult to have collective measures of this nature adopted. The Nordic countries have therefore decided to consider possible measures they could adopt jointly in order to contribute to the isolation of the apartheid regime in South Africa.216.	I would fail in my duty if I did not from this rostrum express the deep distress of my Government at the news reaching us of the death of the young black leader  Steven Biko. We urge the Government of South Africa to invite the International Red Cross to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death. The frequent deaths of political detainees under highly suspicious circumstances greatly aggravate the serious situation in South Africa.217.	On Zimbabwe and Namibia  we hope that ongoing efforts will shortly lead to majority rule and real independence for the peoples of these two countries. 218.	My Government has stepped up its financial and humanitarian aid to the African liberation movements and to the front-line States. It is our intention to further increase our support in the future.219.	Both in Zimbabwe and Namibia it may prove necessary to arrange for a United Nations presence during a transitional period. Norway is prepared to help within the framework of decisions which the United Nations may make and in agreement with the representatives of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia.220.	We have been encouraged by the sustained efforts that have been made to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. The Norwegian Government welcomes these efforts. In our view  there may now be a real opportunity to find a solution to the problem that has been hanging over the Middle East and the rest of the world for the whole of this generation. We therefore urge all parties concerned to show the necessary restraint and a true spirit of compromise  so that this opportunity of achieving a lasting and equitable solution will not be lost.221.	In our view  a peaceful settlement in the Middle East must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).222.	Since the Palestinian question is one of the main elements in the Middle East conflict  the Palestinians should be ensured participation in the negotiations in a manner to be worked out in consultation with all the parties concerned.223.	A real effort must be made by all parties to break the vicious circle of inflexible positions. The Palestinians must recognize the right of Israel to exist as a State within secure and recognized boundaries  in the same way as Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinians to have a homeland. In this connexion I should like to refer to the communiqué from the Nordic Foreign Ministers' meeting earlier this month.224.	To increase respect for human rights must continue to be one of the basic aims of the United Nations. This follows from the Charter itself.225.	The achievements of the United Nations in the field of spelling out the rights of man have been impressive. The global human rights situation nevertheless gives rise to concern.226.	The importance of the work of the United Nations in the field of elaborating norms for the rights of man can be measured only through the impact such norms make in the daily life of human beings all over the world. Human rights should thus be high on the agenda of international co-operation.227.	There is an urgent need to improve the United Nations machinery for the protection of human rights. In this connexion the idea of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights merits positive consideration. The idea is not a new one  but it has  in the view of my Government  never been examined on its full merits.228.	My Government recently submitted to Parliament a white paper on  Norway and the international protection of human rights . Among the main conclusions here were the following. First  international co-operation for protecting human rights must be strengthened. Flagrant and persistent suppression of fundamental human rights are of international concern. Existing United Nations institutions should be provided with the necessary facilities to work more effectively towards this end. Secondly  we want to support non-governmental organisations which constitute an important supplement to intergovernmental bodies  particularly when it comes to mobilizing public support and understanding for human rights. Thirdly  nothing is more an affront to human dignity than the mass poverty  hunger  unemployment and social misery which are allowed to prevail in so large a part of the world. We cannot concentrate on traditional human rights as long as the basic needs of major groups of the world population have not been fulfilled. But neither can we accept that the need for economic and social development is an excuse for such practices as the use of torture  arbitrary arrests and political suppression.229.	I should like to refer briefly to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. My country considers it essential that the new organization for the exploitation of the sea-bed should be given effective powers that will enable it to safeguard the interests of the international community  At the same time it is obvious that the guidelines for the organization's work must take into account the practical possibilities for exploiting the resources of the sea-bed  and create a basis for a reasonable balance between the various interests involved. The Conference is on the point of entering its most crucial phase. It is vital that all countries attend its next session—which we expect to be the last working session—in a spirit of earnest endeavour and friendly compromise.230.	The Secretary-General's report includes this time the following question:  What  in all frankness  is the real position of the United Nations in the affairs of the world? . I will try to answer this question by some reflections on the importance of the United Nations for a small country like my own.231.	Small countries have very limited possibilities indeed to influence the course of international events. For this very reason- they have to rely on a world order founded on the rule of law and not on power  and with rules applying to small and big alike. For this reason our membership in the United Nations-imperfect as the Organization may be—constitutes a corner-stone of my country's foreign policy. For this reason we will contribute to the strengthening of the United Nations' peace-keeping ability and the vital role of the Security Council in this regard. For this reason we are committed to the strengthening of the capacity of the United Nations to meet the many new challenges that are common to all countries. And for this reason we are also anxious to see that the ongoing efforts to restructure the machinery of the United Nations in the economic and social fields will lead to concrete results during this session of the General Assembly."
"96",5269,"NPL",32,1977,"﻿223.	Mr. President  first of all  I feel honoured to convey to you  and  through you  to this distinguished gathering  the greetings and best wishes of my Sovereign His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. I should like to join with those who have preceded me in felicitating you on your election to the high office of the presidency of this session.224.	I take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the most efficient and effective manner in which Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka presided over the last session of the General Assembly.225.	My delegation welcomes in our midst the Republic of Djibouti as an independent and sovereign nation. We are pleased to note that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has gained its rightful place in this Organization  and on this happy occasion we extend our most sincere congratulations to the Government and people of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.226.	The admission of Viet Nam and Djibouti to membership in the United Nations is a positive step towards the universal membership of this Organization. We sincerely hope that the new Members will be able to make substantial contributions  through their active participation in various activities of the United Nations  to the promotion of peace and international understanding.227.	The world community has suffered a great loss in the untimely death of Archbishop Makarios  the President of Cyprus. I wish to convey the heartfelt sympathy of my delegation to the delegation of Cyprus. I should also like to reiterate our full support to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of the problem of Cyprus. A just and lasting settlement of the problem of Cyprus  in our opinion  should be based on the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.228.	In the Middle East the situation is as explosive as ever. Our views on the problem of the Middle East and its solution are clearly established. Israel's withdrawal from the territories occupied by it since 1967 and the creation of a homeland for the Palestinians are essential to a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. At the same time  we recognize the right of all States in the area  including Israel  to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.229.	There is a growing realization that the early resumption of a Middle East peace conference has become urgent. However  no peace conference can be successful without the active involvement of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the representative of the Palestinian people. So long as mutual distrust  fear and suspicion persist among the parties concerned  peace in the Middle East will remain elusive. We share the increasing consciousness in the area that an opportunity now exists to resume negotiations in a meaningful way and that  if this opportunity is not seized  there are grave dangers that the situation will further deteriorate. At this critical time  statesmanship on the part of directly concerned parties consists in acts of moderation and respect for all relevant United Nations resolutions. We have therefore viewed with serious concern the recent measures taken by the Government of Israel to change the demographic composition of some of the areas in the occupied Arab territories.230.	Another area where peace and security are in danger is southern Africa. The minority regimes of South Africa and Zimbabwe have been strongly denounced and isolated. The national liberation movements have received wide international support for their legitimate struggle. But the racist regimes have refused to see the writing on the wall and are pushing the world towards a racial conflagration  as demonstrated by the brutal massacres of the African peoples  the rightful owners of the land.231.	The black people of South Africa have exhibited tremendous unity and courage in their heroic struggle against apartheid  the scourge of mankind. The United Nations has condemned in the strongest terms the measures taken by the racist regime of South Africa to exclude the black population from the political life of the country and to deprive the vast majority of the people of the benefits of their country's wealth. There can be no peace in South Africa unless the policies and practices of apartheid are brought to an end and the equality of rights and opportunities for all its citizens guaranteed.232.	I am pleased to inform the Assembly that His Majesty's Government has recently acceded to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. As one of the supporters of the comprehensive Programme of Action against Apartheid recommended by the General Assembly last year  we believe that the apartheid regime can be completely isolated through mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa and an effective arms embargo. We believe that the Declaration adopted by the World Conference for Action against Apartheid recently held in Lagos  Nigeria 2 s is a landmark in the concerted international campaign against apartheid.233.	The illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa in defiance of repeated demands for its withdrawal by the Security Council and the General Assembly exemplifies the sinister design of the racist regime to perpetuate its occupation of this territory. We extend  as we have done in the past  our full support for the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO to achieve self-determination  freedom and independence in a united Namibia.234.	In Zimbabwe the acts of aggression recently perpetrated by the illegal regime against its neighbours- Mozambique  Botswana and Zambia-have endangered the security and stability of the region. We are deeply concerned at the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe broughtabout by the continued existence of the illegal regime. The urgency of establishing majority rule in that country has been widely felt. My delegation reaffirms our support for the inalienable rights of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence in accordance with resolution 1514  of the General Assembly. We sincerely hope that the mediatory efforts aimed at a peaceful transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe will bear fruit. We have noted with satisfaction that the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held at Maputo in May of this yearns reinforced the solidarity of the world community with the freedom struggle of the oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and gave further impetus to the liberation struggle in those two countries.235.	One of the most urgent problems confronting the international community today is disarmament. Yet it is disheartening to note that there is little evidence of any real progress in this field. The United Nations has been seized of this question ever since its inception. However  after more than three decades of negotiations  bilateral and multilateral agreements  the world today finds itself armed with the most lethal of weapons as never before. The current estimate of world military expenditures almost totals $US 350 billion. This colossal amount could have been diverted and utilized for humanitarian services. Even a fraction of this huge expenditure on armaments would mean a great deal in overcoming the problems of hunger  disease and illiteracy in many parts of the world.236.	It is this factor that has motivated Nepal to support consistently the proposal to reduce military budgets and to divert some amounts available there from for assistance to developing countries. It is  however  unfortunate that the proposal for reduction of military budgets has been lost in the technical imbroglio of how to assess military expenditures.237.	Nepal is totally committed to the cause of disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. We were among the first countries to sign the partial test-ban Treaty and the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. We have always raised our voice in support of various resolutions and agreements relating to disarmament. A bold and sincere initiative in disarmament is needed if tangible progress is to be achieved. Such initiative  if it is to have any practical significance  should come from the nuclear Powers and  more specifically  from the major nuclear Powers.238.	The resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year to hold a special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament is a welcome development. This special session  which is a result of the initiative of the non-aligned countries  could contribute to genuine disarmament. In our opinion  this special session should concentrate on the most urgent of the problems of disarmament  such as the comprehensive test-ban treaty and nuclear non-proliferation. Reports based on latest studies indicating that some hitherto non-nuclear States could go nuclear are indeed most alarming.239.	The establishment of peace zones will contribute to the strengthening of international peace and security. Nepal has consistently supported the General Assembly resolution 2832  regarding the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Similarly  we have supported the proposal of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality of the member States of the Association of South East Asian Nations.240.	In this connexion  it may be recalled that my own country offered itself as a zone of peace  the proposal for which was first made by His Majesty King Birendra on the auspicious occasion of his coronation in February 1975. The support given to this proposal by many of our friends has been highly appreciated in my country. We take this opportunity to reaffirm clearly our position that our proposal in regard to a zone of peace is motivated by our sincere desire to promote national development in an atmosphere of uninterrupted peace. As such  it is directed against no one  and we reiterate our preparedness to carry out the necessary commitments arising from the implementation of the proposal. It is our firm conviction that this proposal  if accepted by the international community  will not only institutionalize peace in our country but will also contribute positively to the furtherance of peace in the region and the world at large. Peace is indeed the basic tenet of our foreign policy. In a recent address to the twenty-eighth session of the Rashtriya Panchayat (National Legislature) His Majesty King Birendra observed: Nepal has always contributed her efforts for peace in the world. It is a well known fact that we want to maintain friendly relations with all countries of the world. We are confident in our belief that cordial relations among neighbours contribute to strengthening the base of regional as well as world peace. 239. As a developing country  Nepal has every reason to be concerned about the unsatisfactory state of the world economy. Lack of substantial progress in the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade and of the decisions and resolutions of the special sessions of the General Assembly has only helped to accentuate the disparities between the rich and the poor countries of the world. Most of the agreed targets of the International Development Strategy have remained unfulfilled. The rate of growth in the total output of many developing countries  including the least developed and most seriously affected' among them  has been less than 4 per cent per annum. Despite the vigorous efforts made by these countries to improve their economies and strengthen their economic infrastructure against tremendous odds and obstacles  their per capita income has remained stagnant. Inflation  the deteriorating terms of trade and the increasing indebtedness of many developing countries are most disconcerting.240. It is also a matter of deep concern that the Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund  held in March 1977  could not yield positive results. Similarly  there has been little progress in the multilateral trade negotiations in GATT on the reduction of trade barriers of developed countries  which restrict the exports of primary and processed commodities from developing countries. The failure of the developed countries to implement the measures set forth in the Strategy with regard to trade and the flow of technical and financial resources is largely responsible for the short-falls in many developing countries.241.	While the attainment of $1 billion in pledges to the International Fund for Agricultural Development is a welcome development and we look forward to the early operation of this fund  the proposed target of not less than 500 000 tons for an emergency food reserve has not been attained. Similarly  no firm decision has been taken so far in the area of food security. If the agricultural production of the developing countries is to be increased to at least the level recommended in the International Development Strategy  international assistance should be enhanced and trade in agricultural products liberalized.242.	The expansion since 1970 in external aid to the least developed countries has been offset by a decline in the purchasing power of their exports. A further substantial increase in the financial flows to these countries is  therefore  essential with emphasis on grants and concessional loans. In my previous statements to the General Assembly I made the proposal that the assistance for international development should be conceived of as  international taxation  of the rich developed countries. I reiterate my proposal  the relevance of which has by no means been lost in the present context.243.	It is deeply regrettable that the United Nations Special Fund set up in 1974 to aid developing countries most seriously affected by economic crisis has not been able to get off the ground for lack of voluntary contributions from industrialized countries. The establishment of a Special Fund designed to compensate for high costs of transportation incurred by land-locked developing countries was approved by the General Assembly last year. We appeal to the rich developed countries and other potential donors to contribute generously to the Fund so that it may become operational without delay. We believe that the international community is fully aware of the grim predicament which the least developed as well as land-locked developing countries are facing today. Conditions in these countries will get worse unless urgent concrete measures are taken to boost their economies and improve the living standards of their peoples.244.	My delegation attaches great importance to economic co-operation among developing countries as a means of strengthening the solidarity of the peoples of these countries. It should  however  be borne in mind that there are different levels of development even among the developing countries  and for effective economic co-operation it is essential that special attention should be paid to the problems  needs and aspirations of those countries which are less developed among them.245.	The new international economic order symbolizes the aspirations of developing countries for economic justice. Within this framework  the goals and objectives of the International Development Strategy should be critically examined and reformulated  so as to build a new structure of international economic relations based on justice and equity. It is regrettable that the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly could not reach agreement on a unanimous assessment of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation. We believe in intensified negotiations and hope that renewed efforts will be made  by the developed countries in particular  during the present session to secure positive and concrete results on all issues relating to the establishment of the new international economic order. Energy being one of the critical factors affecting the economies of many countries  my delegation welcomes the recent proposal of the Secretary-General for an international institution  within the framework of the United Nations  to co-ordinate development of the world's energy resources .246.	The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea also ended on an inconclusive note. While the continuing deadlock in the informal negotiations tends to be disappointing  we have emphasized in the past  and we do so again  that the new international convention on the law of the sea cannot be considered in isolation from the global perspective of a new order based on equity and justice. The convention on the law of the sea  if it is to be commonly acceptable  must take into account the legitimate aspirations and interests of all the parties concerned. However  the refusal of the group of coastal States to respond to the fundamental demands of land-locked countries  such as their right to participate on an equitable basis in the exploitation of the living resources of the economic zone of adjoining coastal States and States of the same region or subregion  threatens to nullify the concept of the common heritage of mankind.247.	As a land-locked developing country  Nepal is acutely aware of the hardships facing other countries in a similar geographically disadvantageous situation. We have all along been drawing the attention of the international community to the fact that the condition of our development is closely linked to our land-locked position. Therefore  the right of free access to and from the sea and the right of unrestricted transit in terms of the free flow of goods and people are of paramount concern to land-locked countries. We hope that these fundamental legitimate concerns of the land-locked countries will be incorporated in the new international convention on the law of the sea.248.	In conclusion  we reiterate on this occasion our unflinching commitment to the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. The United Nations is decidedly the best instrument for promoting greater understanding  co-operation  peace and harmony among nations. The world Organization has proved in its lifetime to be an effective forum for nations with different social and political systems to reach agreement or consensus on major issues of political and economic significance through peaceful negotiations. The failures and drawbacks of the United Nations are outweighed by its positive achievements. Several conferences on wide-ranging issues like food  environment  population  water  science and technology  and technical co-operation among developing countries that have been held and are being held under the auspices of this Organization are a glowing testimony to the fact that all countries  big and small  rich or poor  developed and developing  are convinced of the continuing importance and relevance of the United Nations. We should  therefore  continue to emphasize the need for further strengthening the role of the United Nations in the fulfilment of its objectives and ideals. In doing so  we should always keep uppermost in our minds the vision of a new world order based on peace  progress and justice for all mankind."
"97",5333,"NZL",32,1977,"﻿74.	 Mr. President  I offer you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of this Assembly. It is at once a notable mark of confidence in you personally and a timely acknowledgement of your country's standing in the world community.75.	We welcome as new Members the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. New Zealand was privileged to be a sponsor of Viet Nam's application for membership. We did so not merely because of our belief in the value of universal membership of the United Nations  but because we regard the participation of Viet Nam as indispensable in the task of solving the pressing problems of South-East Asia. We look forward to developing a positive relationship with this dynamic State both within the United Nations system and in our direct bilateral dealings.76.	This year's General Assembly  like its predecessors  confronts awesome problems which we human beings have created and which—we must believe—human beings have the intelligence to solve  if only we can summon the will and forge the consensus. Our Secretary-General has pinpointed the issues in his valuable report. Many of them have been with us for a long time. Others  as he notes  are new. All directly affect the peace  security and welfare of our fragile world community. Indeed  they are basic to its continued functioning and even to its continued existence.77.	Whether the issue be the softening of the expensive and potentially deadly rivalry between the super-Power?;  whether it be the establishment of human justice for all the people of southern Africa and the Middle East  whether it be the imperative of a more just and workable international economic order  whether it be the conservation and orderly use of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed  whether it be the sensible management and sharing of the finite resources of this planet  whether it be the halting and reversal of the arms race-whatever the issue  all of us have a direct stake in the outcome. No one of us can opt out. All of us face the challenge; all of us will share the responsibility if we fail to find solutions and then uphold them in good faith.78.	It would  of course  be naive to pretend that this body is an objective research institution or a philanthropic agency  or that national or regional interests are likely to be set aside  or that advances will be made except step by step through deals and compromises. That is the nature of national or international political institutions  of which this is one. We represent our constituents  and they have their interests and their aspirations  to which we must be responsive. But all of us  I think  can feel in our bones that in its economic  no less than its political  condition the world is not many steps away from chaos; and that for all of us the consequences of failure are so grave that  however intractable the problems  however elusive the solutions  we are called upon to make the effort to face them with seriousness and compassion. We are then in the area of attitudes. Attitudes determine political will  and without a shift of attitudes the indispensable consensus will continue to elude us.79.	No issue calls more urgently for agreement among us than that of the more just and effective use of the world's economic resources. It is at our peril that we should ignore the fact that one third of our fellow beings are subsisting in conditions of destitution and mounting despair  that  after two decades of international consideration and some  but all too little  action  development problems have increased in magnitude  that  despite dozens of conferences  the relative position of the people of the developing countries has each year steadily deteriorated.80.	in recently reviewing the decline in the terms of trade of countless which produce agricultural exports  and considering measures such as the supplementary financing facility established by the IMF  my Prime Minister made this observation:""We cannot say to a poor country  'We will pay you much less in relative terms for your goods than we used to pay  but you need not worry as we will lend you the balance at market rates of interest providing you take the steps to lower the standard of living of your people.' It is difficult "" he said  ""to cut what you haven't got.""81.	As an exporter of agricultural products  New Zealand has suffered greatly from declining terms of trade and  I might add  from the social burdens involved in adjusting to a greatly reduced income. We are therefore well placed to understand the far greater difficulties of the oil-deficient developing countries. We claim no special sympathy for New Zealand because we are well placed by comparison with most of the world's population. But our difficulties stem from causes similar to some of those which frustrate the developing world: declining terms of trade for countries which export agricultural goods and Increasing protectionism on the part of the affluent industrial countries. In many countries belts have already been tightened up to  and beyond  what is socially and politically acceptable. We must all think in terms not of palliatives but of fundamental shifts of attitudes and policies.82.	In such a situation more attention must be given  not just to financing deficits and tightening the belt  but to enabling the primary producing and newly industrializing countries to increase their earnings. And this must involve facing squarely two fundamental questions  namely  the relationship between the prices of primary products and industrial goods  and the question of access to the markets of the affluent industrial countries of the world. These are political questions of the greatest importance  questions that must be tackled by those in whose power it lies to diminish both surpluses and deficits. And surely it must be obvious that for the rich  industrialized world to do so would be no more than enlightened self-interest. Could it not help to revitalize their faltering economies and to provide their societies with a renewed purpose and sense of direction?83.	The problem is  of course  at the very essence of politics. It is the far from easy task of convincing electorates and  more specifically  of ensuring that special interest groups in those electorates are harnessed to wider national and international imperatives. We are convinced that most of the leaders of countries whose policies will determine the course of the world's economy  and the social and political ramifications of those policies  are aware of what must be done if the looming economic and political chaos is to be avoided. Their problem  and the problem of all in government  is to mobilize sufficient determination and creative leadership to change entrenched attitudes and to confront those interests which  however obsolete they may be  are nevertheless deeply entrenched in their national history and their political processes. But time is short  and it is running out.84.	I have concentrated some attention on She responsibilities of the affluent market-economy nations  but it is not only their problem. It is the problem of all  regardless of ideology  regardless of economic system.85.	There appears to be a general recognition that it is within the United Nations framework that the efforts of the international community to promote such action should be carried forward. The present session of the General Assembly has a special responsibility to put in hand preparations for a new international development strategy. The conclusions and agreements of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation held earlier this year need to be followed up.86.	New Zealand was not a participant at the Paris Conference. We have  however  welcomed the progress made  and my Government has now completed its study of the measures agreed at that Conference. We endorse the agreements reached  limited though these were  and will take up the debate in the various forums concerned on the topics left uncompleted.87.	An important element in our efforts to promote development and greater equity in the distribution of the world's resources is  of course  international energy cooperation  with particular reference to the interests and needs of energy-deficient developing countries. We are encouraged that the Secretary-General has recently made proposals for such co-operation within the United Nations system  and we shall play our part in working out this concept in the course of this session and thereafter.88.	It is now almost three years since the World Food Conference decided to establish an International Fund for Agricultural Development. The Fund represents a new approach to the age-old problem of world hunger-the pooling  on a hitherto unprecedented scale  of resources to be devoted exclusively to improving agriculture in developing countries. The Fund's initial pledging target of SI billion was achieved at the beginning of the year  and the Agreement establishing the Fund was thrown open for signature in February. New Zealand will formally ratify the agreement today. We look forward to its early entry into force and the fulfilment of initial pledges by donor countries so that operations may begin.89.	New Zealand will also participate actively and constructively in the resumed session of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities. We earn our living by the export of primary produce  and therefore share the concern of developing countries that greater stability should be introduced into the commodity markets of the world.90.	New Zealand is experiencing the most prolonged and deep-seated recession in its post-war economic history. This fact has sharpened our appreciation of the lot of developing countries. It has  however  circumscribed our ability to help those beyond our shores  but we remain pledged to the target of 0.7 per cent for official development assistance  and we shall move again towards that target as soon as our economic circumstances permit.91.	In our interdependent world there are no issues that can be considered in isolation. The refashioning of the global economic system is closely linked to negotiating settlements in southern Africa and the Middle East  to halting the arms race  and to controlling and ultimately eliminating weapons of mass destruction. The more we can establish conditions of security and stability the more chance there is of securing the massive diversion of resources and the rearrangement of economic activity needed to reduce the unacceptable disparities that new exist among nations. How  then  do we address these problems?92.	All of us agree that the situation in southern Africa is a tragedy  c tragedy compounded by intransigence and repression  a tragedy of expanding and enveloping dimensions. Change must come  and it will come. The question is not if  but how. Here  of course  there is less agreement.93.	Some claim that armed struggle is the only way; and if intransigence persists they will  of course  be right. But it is a way that would extract a terrible price in human lives and suffering and would create bitter problems for the future.94.	When the Anglo-American proposals on Rhodesia were announced  I said publicly that they offered the last chance for a peaceful settlement. If the Smith regime tosses this chance away it might buy itself a little time  but it can only be a time of tension and a time of knowing that the end will almost certainly be bloodshed in Salisbury and Bulawayo. I would urge the Smith regime to realize it  not only for their own sake - but also for the sake of Zimbabwe as a whole.95.	There has been some progress on Namibia. The southern African authorities have apparently recognized the futility of pressing ahead with the Turnhalle proposals and have accepted the need for elections on the basis of one man  one vote. The Maputo Conference showed them  if they needed any showing  that the international community is united in its demand that Namibia should be free and independent. But if there has been some progress  there remain formidable problems. One of the most taxing is that of Walvis Bay. There can be no question that any exclusion of Walvis Bay from Namibia would undermine that country's integrity and impede significantly its chances of building a viable economy.96.	The gravest problems are those of South Africa. They are complex and deep-rooted. And they are on a huge scale. White South Africa remains to be convinced that it has no alternative but to accept fundamental changes of attitude. Even a society that is as inward-looking and as determined to go its own way as South Africa cannot survive alone. It is part of the world whether it likes it or not. If the rest of the world makes it clear that it will have nothing to do withSouth Africa so long as it persists with its discriminatory policies  the pressure for change will sooner or later become irresistible.97.	We in New Zealand have played our part in this process. We took part in the Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid and subscribed  without reservation  to the terms of the Lagos Declaration. We have minimal trade with South Africa and virtually no investment. We have supported the Swedish initiative calling for the ending of all new investment in South Africa. We have refused to contemplate any exchange of diplomatic representatives. My Government is actively discouraging sporting contacts. We support the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the appeal for South African refugee students. We are opposed to the creation of the so-called ""Bantustans""' which would seek to make black South Africans aliens in their own country. We have scrupulously observed the voluntary arms embargo and will give our full support to any proposal to establish a mandatory arms embargo in terms of the appropriate provisions of the Charter. We have taken a forthright stand in pressing for the release of political prisoners and in condemning the brutal treatment which has led to the unexplained deaths in confinement of more than one black leader-most recently Steven Biko. In short  we shall do all we can to bring about the atmosphere in which a just solution of the problems of racism and minority rule in South Africa might be achieved before a long  drawn-out and bloody armed struggle becomes inevitable.98.	The Arab-Israeli dispute is another problem that threatens world peace. It is a dispute about which we have little direct knowledge and we are certainly not well placed to presume to offer any new ideas on how it can be resolved. Even so  it seems to us that certain things stand out. One is that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) must continue to form the basis-for any settlement. We are obliged  therefore  to reject any attempt by one party to the dispute to pursue policies that are contrary to the principles laid down in resolution 242(1967). We believe that territory occupied by Israel must be returned.99.	The second thing is that the Palestinian people have a right to a homeland  either as a separate State or as a part of a larger  Arab State. The precise boundaries of that homeland are a matter for negotiations by the parties directly concerned. But if there is to be a peace in the Middle East  the principle must be recognized. It does not derogate in any way from the fundamental right of Israel to exist as a sovereign  independent State within secure and recognized boundaries  free from threat by any acts of force  and indeed we believe that a final territorial settlement will confirm and help to protect that right.100.	And  finally  it is imperative that negotiations begin soon. The longer a start is delayed  the greater the build-up of tension and the greater the chances of the outbreak of another war. Obviously  to be constructive  negotiations must include all the parties to the dispute  including the Palestinians  through their chosen representatives.101.	In another long-standing dispute  that between North and South Korea  the resumption of early negotiations between the parties directly concerned is  in our view  an urgent requirement. My Government remains deeply concerned lest the tensions on the peninsula should lead  once again  to confrontation. It is our earnest hope that  during the pause in international deliberations on the problem  a peaceful solution can be found through negotiations between the two Korean parties. New Zealand hopes that all Governments which are in a position to encourage this peaceful means to a solution will use their influence accordingly.102.	We have a deep concern also for the security and prosperity of South-East Asia. We therefore welcome the co-operative  constructive efforts of the countries of the region through the Association of South-East Asian Nations. ASEAN is a non-military association dedicated to the establishment of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Its leaders have made clear on many occasions their desire to promote friendship and understanding with their neighbours. We hope they will soon get a response. For our part we are glad to be associated with ASEAN in its efforts to improve the well-being of the people of this area.103.	This same developing regional co-operation is to be found so in our own part of the world  the South Pacific. There  the South Pacific Forum  a group of ten States  five of which are represented in this Assembly  is the principal vehicle for co-operation and consultation. Two of the Forum's recent initiative deserve particular mention. In June it was agreed to establish a regional shipping line  the Pacific Forum Line. Ships are to be chartered to the Line by participating Governments and it will operate services within the region  commencing early next year. Sea transport  of course  is the key to economic development in the region and the Forum Line will open new possibilities.104.	The second major initiative was the agreement of the Forum  at its most recent meeting in Papua New Guinea  to establish a fisheries agency to co-ordinate and develop protection and surveillance of fisheries within the economic zones of member countries. The proper control of this huge area  which in total is one of the largest in the world  is clearly beyond the capability of any one member country. By sharing their skills and knowledge  the members will be able to exploit their resources to the best advantage of all countries in the region. At the same time the establishment of exclusive economic zones in the South Pacific and of a regional fishing agency in no way diminishes the importance for the area of the early completion of the treaty on the law of the sea. It is our earnest hope that negotiations will result in an agreed text during 1978.105.	Before I leave the subject of regional co-operation I should like to refer  very briefly  to the signing on 7 September in Washington of the Panama Canal Treaties. This is a significant advance which my Government welcomes. We see the agreements as a milestone for the principal parties  the United States and the Republic of Panama  for the Americas as a whole  and for countries as far flung as my own. The large volume of our trade which passes through the Canal causes us to take a positive interest in its security and efficiency. I warmly congratulate the Governments concerned.106.	The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the basic purposes of the United Nations and next year will be the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. New Zealand attaches great importance to the Universal Declaration and to the values enunciated in the International Covenants on Human Rights  the one covering political and civil rights  the other economic  social and cultural rights.107.	Before formally committing ourselves to the Covenants we have sought to ensure that in every respect our laws and juridical system were capable of enforcing the obligations of those Covenants. This has been a lengthy task involving the drafting of new legislation. That task is now substantially completed. Enactment of this legislation will mean that our laws will sustain any scrutiny under the Covenants. I expect  therefore  that we will ratify both those Covenants  as well as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide not later than 1978. Respect for human rights  for human dignity and the individual's fundamental freedoms have long had a central place in our traditions and values. Through this codification the law in fact will have caught up with our practice.108.	In preparing for the ratification of the Covenants the New Zealand Government has drafted  and Parliament is expected to adopt during the current parliamentary session  a measure which will outlaw every kind of discrimination based on sex or religion. Racial discrimination is already contrary to New Zealand tradition  law and practice and New Zealand reports regularly to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Under the new legislation a national commission of human rights will be established to deal with complaints of racial  religious or sexual discrimination. This legislation should facilitate New Zealand's signature and ratification of the draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women when it is adopted—in the preparation of which New Zealand has taken an active part. We hope it will be completed and opened for signature at the present session of the Assembly.109.	I have touched on a number of problems and I want now to turn to the most menacing of all-the arms race. No other issue before this Assembly creates greater hopes and engenders greater despair. The gap between our aspirations and our achievements frustrates and dispirits us  and that gap must be closed.110.	There has been some progress. It is encouraging that at last serious negotiations have begun among three of the nuclear-weapon States on the content of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. This will provide the most effective restriction on vertical nuclear proliferation so far and is clearly the first priority. We hope that a generally accepted comprehensive test-ban treaty will have been drafted by the time the special session is held. No other development  in our judgement  would provide a happier augury for the success of that session. We do not consider acceptable to wait for technology to solve all the political problems confronting a test ban. This would be to wait indefinitely and perhaps for ever. The time for action is now.111.	None of the great issues before this Assembly are capable of quick or simple solution. But we can make a start  and if the will is present we can move progressively and consistently to the settlement of our disputes  to the changing of attitudes and to the reconciliation of our differences. The New Zealand delegation approaches this session of the Assembly determined to work conscientiously towards that objective. "
"98",5378,"OMN",32,1977,"﻿198.	 Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation and myself  I extend our sincerest congratulations on your election as President of this session  and I express my confidence that the work of the session will produce achievements of benefit to all in our international community. We have the advantage of your long experience  combined with your renowned skill and wisdom  and the earnest efforts of your Government in the service of peace. Therefore  Mr. President  I have no doubt that you will perform the functions entrusted to you in the best possible manner.199.	I must also commend the excellent performance of your outstanding predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  in conducting the previous session  which covered many important tasks  and I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his ceaseless efforts in the service of this Organization and its Charter. I should also like to take this occasion to welcome the new Members which-have joined our Organization at this session.200.	My country recognizes the great importance of the role of the United Nations in promoting and supporting world peace and security and in accelerating co-operation between all nations in all possible fields  in order to bring welfare and stability to the entire human community and to arrest the catastrophes of war and the evil effects of conflict and dissension  which destroy the hopes of everyone for security  stability and a free and decent life.201.	While we are aware of the numerous and important achievements of the United Nations in the service of international peace and security  and in the development of economic and social co-operation among various countries  we feel that the United Nations has not realized its full potential in either of those two fields. Neither world peace nor international economic co-operation is as widespread as it ought to be. Now  more than ever before  there is an urgent need in both those fields for joint and continuous efforts to eliminate the threats to international peace and to remove the existing obstacles to greater international economic co-operation.202.	The most dangerous threat to international peace and security is the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East resulting from Israel's defiance of the international mandate represented by the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions.203.	Israel's deliberate obstruction of the present peace efforts exposes the area to the danger of a new and explosive armed conflict  the destructive consequences of which will not be confined to the Middle East region but will extend to the whole world.204.	At present the Middle East is at a cross-roads: either the peace efforts will succeed and a just and permanent peace will be achieved in the area  or they will fail  leading inevitably to a new and terrifying eruption.205.	The international community  whose mandate has been entrusted to the Assembly  has no choice but to support and endorse the rule of law and justice  to seek peace  to put an end to Israel's intransigence and to demand that Israel respect international law and implement United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) condemning the acquisition of foreign territories by force and calling for the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories which it has occupied since 1967. In this regard the international community must also see to it that the Palestinian people is given its full  legitimate and inalienable rights.206.	My country's absolute belief that peace and security for the whole of the international community are inextricably linked causes it to view with grave concern the dangerous intervention of external Powers in the internal affairs of the peoples of the African continent.207.	Occurring after the long and bitter struggle for independence by the African peoples  this foreign intervention aggravates the problems of this continent and dims its countries' prospects for that genuine peace which Africa and-the international community are seeking  especially after the long sufferings endured by those countries in their struggle for independence. We see in this foreign intervention nothing but a blow to the hopes and aspirations of the African peoples in their pursuit of a free and peaceful life in accordance with a system of free choice and self-determination  free of any foreign interference.208.	The aim of this foreign intervention is also the destruction of existing efforts to find solutions to the urgent problems of the African continent  solutions which will lead to security  stability and the development of the economic capabilities of the African peoples.209.	The implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace will exempt that region from international conflicts  thereby freeing its peoples to develop their countries in a climate of security and stability and enable them to participate more effectively in solving the problems confronting mankind.210.	A problem which is still a source of great concern to us all is the arms race between the super-Powers. In addition to the huge waste of financial resources which it entails  the arms race is dragging the world to the brink of a bottomless pit. For that reason  and recognizing the fact that the United Nations has not in recent years reached an adequate agreement on the numerous matters related to disarmament  we see a need to increase our efforts to take new steps to achieve progress in this area.211.	We look forward to a discussion of the subject of disarmament at the coming special session of the United Nations devoted to that purpose and we hope that fruitful progress will be achieved through it.212.	Also  the slowdown in international detente places a special responsibility on the two super-Powers  principally because of the continuation of conflicts between them. The effect of these conflicts is not limited to preventing effective co-operation between the two super-Powers in solving the multiple problems facing the world. In addition  this strife also has a negative effect on the policies of other countries associated with the two super-Powers. This leads  in turn  to the aggravation of regional conflicts which might easily be solved but for the involvement of the superpowers. Therefore  the responsibility for maintaining world peace and security  while the common responsibility of all countries  falls predominantly on the two super-Powers  which have a greater stake in peace and security and which  therefore  should seek an end to their long-standing conflicts and guard the interests of the international community  guaranteeing its security and stability.213.	I shall turn now to contemporary international economic problems. Without a doubt  there is now a certain measure of economic co-operation among our countries  but we hope to achieve greater co-operation in order to enable the developing countries to increase their growth rates. In the interest of the goals of development and economic growth for the developing nations  we call for a redoubling of effort directed towards international trade and foreign aid. We hope that the dialogue will continue both on measures to fight inflation and to lighten the burden of debt and interest and on other matters often touched upon in this forum by the developing countries.214.	To be realistic  it is not by our awareness of the integrated nature of the international economy nor by our conviction as to the necessity for economic co-operation among nations that we shall surmount the international economic problems facing our world today. In the international community there are countries which made big strides in economic development and which have already established an industrial base with trained cadres of workers supporting their economic affluence and pushing it forward. There are also other countries  unfortunately constituting the great majority  which lack sufficient resources to develop their economies independently. Those countries are therefore in need of foreign assistance for their development efforts.215.	For the realization of the integrated world economy based on sound co-operation among States  which we all advocate  there rests on each of the two groups a special responsibility related to their respective economic situation. It is possible for the developing countries to redouble their growth efforts by concentrating on productive growth activities chosen according to enlightened policies. By the same token  the developed countries must allocate more economic aid to the developing countries to accelerate their growth and progress. The co-ordinated efforts of the developing countries  on the one hand  and the positive assistance of the developed countries in support of these efforts  on the other  is the ideal combination to bring favourable results and lessen economic disparity in the world.216.	Naturally  the issue cannot be resolved by considering it a matter of assistance. As we know  there is an acute need to increase the measure of economic and commercial co-operation between the countries of the two groups so as to bring about greater responsiveness to the requirements of the developing countries than we observe today. There is also the problem of transfer of technology to the developing countries. This transfer must be facilitated and accelerated to enable the developing countries to build up their industries rationally and in the shortest possible time. Still another problem is posed by the ratio between the prices of the raw materials exported by the developing countries and the industrial products they import from the developed countries. There is a need to arrive at an equitable and logical link between the prices of the two classes of commodities.217.	We have followed the North-South dialogue which took place in Paris between the developed and the developing countries for the purpose of establishing the foundations for a new international economic order that would assure greater justice to the developing countries.218.	Although this dialogue did not realize everything which we had hoped for  it has produced some limited measures such as  for example  the joint fund to finance commodity stocks under the Integrated Programme for Commodities and also certain rules related to governmental assistance for development. We hope that the developed countries will implement those resolutions and pursue their dialogue with the developing countries to lay the basis for a new international economic order serving the interests of all. We therefore call for the resumption of the North-South dialogue. With the same enthusiasm and for the same reason  we hope that the Arab-European dialogue will continue more positively than ever for the enhancement of our mutual interests and benefits.219.	My country has always participated in the numerous sessions of the Conference on the Law of the Sea  believing in the special importance of this Conference to all countries of the world  whether coastal or land-locked. My country  being a coastal State  has been contributing working papers and ideas since the second session in Caracas  in the conviction that it will help  albeit in a limited way  towards establishing an international legal framework for the various issues being discussed or considered at these sessions. It was the hope of my country  among many others  that the most recent session would conclude  as was indeed expected  with the formulation of an international treaty encompassing those various ideas  aspects  issues and principles of the law of the sea. Although our hope was not fulfilled  there is no doubt that we must support what has been achieved thus far. We hope that the next session will succeed in its assignment  and in realizing our hopes.220.	All this having been said  there is one more subject to which my country attaches great importance and to which it is committed with the utmost seriousness and loyalty. I refer to the concept of regional co-operation in all its aspects  as the working basis for expansion of co-operation on an international scale. A regional structure with the majority of participants having cultural affinity and interdependent economies  in addition to geographical proximity  is the surest guarantee for the success of co-operation on its fullest scale among countries having such bonds. If regional co-operation is practised in a manner well adapted to the capabilities of the member countries of the regional group  with full scope given for possibilities of industrial- economic co-ordination and integration  each member country will benefit  relationships will be strengthened  the spirit of friendship and good neighbourliness will be promoted  and the possibilities of conflict will be removed.221.	In this belief  and with the guidance of His Majesty Sultan Qabus bin Said  my country has taken the initiative in establishing co-operation of this kind in our region and is pursuing it with full dedication  cherishing the hope that greater co-operation among our countries in all possible fields will be achieved for the common benefit of all States and peoples in the region.222.	Since the day on which my country joined the international family  it has been working at home and abroad  striving earnestly to keep abreast of modern developments  taking great strides in self-development  making full use of the experience of more advanced people—all in the belief that human experience is the common heritage of all mankind and that the international community no longer consists of isolated entities.223.	There remains one final subject on which I really did not intend to speak. But regrettably and despite my awareness of your valuable time  I find myself compelled to exercise my right of reply to the unfounded and fallacious statements made by the Chairman of the PresidentialCouncil of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen before this Assembly at its 16th meeting  on Monday  3 October.224.	Allow me first to point out that the statements of the speaker from South Yemen are not only a travesty of the facts but also constitute a direct interference in the internal affairs of a Member State in violation of the provisions and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  a matter which the United Nations always tends to avoid.225.	Since its independence  Southern Yemen  driven by sinister motives of aggression  is always breeding conflicts in order to endanger peace and security in the Arabian peninsula. To do so it has sponsored terrorist organizations in execution of the designs of one of the superpowers. The Sultanate of Oman  together with other Arab States  tried to help Southern Yemen to get rid of this alien and foreign influence. We assured and reiterated our readiness to help before the non-aligned Conference held in Colombo last year. Yet it is evident that the ruling clique in Aden is not only aiming at stirring up disorder and instability in the region  but is also bent on crushing the fundamentals of the national spirit of the people of Southern Yemen  which has led to the butchering of thousands and the assassination of leaders inside and outside Southern Yemen. This resulted in the influx of more than half a million refugees to neighbouring countries. These refugees were forced to leave their homes and live in neighbouring countries  thus causing those countries innumerable problems. These people were driven out of Southern Yemen  not because they had committed any offence  but solely because of their refusal to abandon their religious and spiritual heritage and convictions and be subjected to unjust alien laws and ideologies.226.	The real danger which we face and which the international community faces is the fact that the policies of Southern Yemen are fundamentally based on the policies of terrorism. Its terrorist agents are feverishly bent on creating chaos and disorder in the region. Our main worry here is that navigation in the Strait of Hormuz should not be endangered by the acts of these terrorists. Such acts could affect the safety and passage of international oil tankers through this Strait  which is so vital and important to the whole world. My country has a special responsibility in safeguarding international navigation through the Strait of Hormuz and we shall never allow it to be threatened or endangered. We hold Southern Yemen fully responsible for having created certain circumstances by adopting policies of supporting and abetting terrorist- organizations  to the detriment of the whole world economy. There is no need to confirm this here  because it has already been confirmed from this rostrum by the Chairman of the Presidential Council of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. We only intended to bring these facts to the attention of Member States. We had hoped that Southern Yemen would pursue a realistic policy of peaceful coexistence among all the regimes in the region  but  regrettably  the ruling clique in Aden declared unequivocally before this Assembly that they do not intend to bring about favourable conditions for coexistence  peace and stability in this part of the world. A State such as Southern Yemen  which completely ignores its international responsibilities  is not worthy of support or membership in the international family. It is not a responsible regime able or willing to maintain the interests of its people or to work  with the rest of the world  for the objectives of peace and security. We affirm here that  inasmuch as we believe in the Charter of the United Nations  and inasmuch as we are committed to creating good and friendly relations with our neighbours  we will never relinquish our sovereignty or independence and will never allow any interference in our internal affairs.227.	The Sultanate of Oman sincerely extends the hand of friendship and fruitful co-operation to all the countries of the world  without making any distinction as to social or political regime; it honours the principles of respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of others  concentrates its efforts on self-development  co-operates with all in what is beneficial to all  and upholds at all times the Charter of the United Nations and strives to apply its principles to best effect.

"99",5424,"PAK",32,1977,"﻿178.	 Mr. President  permit me to extend our warm congratulations to you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. Your elevation is a tribute to your vast experience and deep knowledge of the work of the United Nations as well as to the important role played by Yugoslavia in world affairs.179.	I should also like to express my delegations deep appreciation of the distinction with which Ambassador Amerasinghe presided over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  and for his contribution as President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and in the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  to mention but a few of his many-sided achievements.180.	The admission of Viet Nam and Djibouti to membership in the United Nations has moved us still closer to the goal of universal representation in the world Organization. Pakistan was in full sympathy with the epic struggle of the Vietnamese people and we are gratified to see this heroic nation take its rightful place in the United Nations. We also welcome the admission of the brotherly Republic of Djibouti  whose independence marks a further step in the process of decolonization.181.	The world is  as always  in the process of change. Although the trend towards coexistence between the two major military blocs has been maintained over the last year  the relations between those blocs have not been altogether free of a degree of unease and suspicion reminiscent of a past era. In other parts of the world too  while there have been encouraging developments such as the signing of the Panama Canal treaties  persisting as well as new problems provoke anxious concern for peace. There is a general awareness that glaring inequalities in the distribution of political and economic power constitute the most serious threat to international stability and are in increasingly urgent need of correction and solution.182.	With Pakistan  an acute political crisis followed the controversial elections of last March. Serious political discord and the threat of renewed violence compelled the armed forces of Pakistan to assume the responsibility for the administration of the country for an interim period. The objective was to restore a climate in which fair and free elections will be held  and thus to reinstate the process of democracy.183.	The election campaign is now in progress in an atmosphere of complete freedom and security. The state of emergency  imposed as long ago as 1971  has recently been lifted. The head of the interim Government  General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq  has declared and reiterated his firm resolve to transfer power to the elected representatives of the people after the national elections  scheduled for 18 October.184.	The internal developments in Pakistan imply no change in our foreign policy  which is based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and dedicated to the strengthening of mutually advantageous relations with all countries of the world. In its very first policy pronouncement the interim Government affirmed its resolve to abide by all international agreements  commitments and undertakings entered into by predecessor Governments. As in the past  Pakistan continues to attach primary importance to the maintenance and further development of its relations with all the major Powers. And  in conformity with the deepest aspirations of the people of Pakistan  the interim Government is determined further to consolidate and reinforce fraternal ties with Iran  Turkey  the brotherly Arab States and other countries  especially those of the third world.185.	A month ago Pakistan and Bangladesh initiated further steps to reinforce their close ties of faith  culture and a shared history. With Afghanistan we shall continue our endeavours to normalize relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness.186.	In relations between Pakistan and India  the process of normalization set into motion by the Simla Agreement of July 1972 has maintained satisfactory progress. Though inevitably gradual  the pace of normalization could accelerate  given a continuity of commitment to the universally recognized principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence and non-interference in internal affairs  and a peaceful settlement over Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan will continue to strive for a just and honourable settlement of this 30-year-old dispute in accordance with the Simla spirit and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.187.	It is recognized that lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian-people  including their right to establish a State of their own. For their part the Arabs have made a substantial concession by expressing their readiness to accept the right of all States in the region to live in peace with one another Security Council resolution 242 (1967) was adopted in the wake of the Israeli aggression of 1967 and reflected the weight of military victory. However  the decisions of the United Nations  taken together  and the policies of all major Powers and groups of countries postulate the threefold condition of Israeli withdrawal  a Palestinian State and peaceful coexistence for the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Yet  the hope for peace remains elusive. In respect of each of these conditions  Israeli policy has moved from ambiguity to intransigence. The notion that Israel should annex the West Bank because it was the site of the biblical lands of Judaea and Samaria is an assertion of the right of conquest and has nothing to do with peace and security among nations. Similarly  Israel's refusal to deal with the rightful and recognized representatives of the people of Palestine is intended to wipe out the very identity of a people with ancient and historic roots in occupied territories. The establishment of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and the extension of Israeli laws to that territory have the same end in view. The statements and actions of the new Israeli Government demonstrate clearly that Israel's objective is not security but expansion and domination. The United Nations is committed by its decisions to total Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories as also to the creation withdrawal from occupied territories as also to the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State. The General Assembly must therefore denounce the recent Israeli moves as illegal and as an obstacle to peace. They have been so denounced by Israel's closest supporters. Those obstacles must be removed if deepening frustration and tension are not to lead to yet another armed conflict in the area—a conflict whose political and economic consequences will be disastrous and are not likely to be confined to the region.188.	In southern Africa as in the Middle East  a viable peace can be evolved only on the basis of principles which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and form the basis of the pertinent decisions of the Organization. The question in Zimbabwe is the transfer of power to the representatives of the black majority  and in this context the maintenance of law and order during the transition period assumes particular importance. We believe that the Owen-Young proposals regarding arrangements for transfer of power to the majority community are a step in the right direction and contain positive elements. However  the provisions for a peaceful transition must allow no loop-holes that would permit the Smith regime to obstruct in any way the transition to majority rule in the shortest possible time. We consider that in the interests of all the inhabitants of Zimbabwe  whatever their race or affiliation  the United Nations should not shirk from taking firm action under Chapter VII of the Charter to defeat Mr. Smith's intransigence.189.	Resolute action in accordance with United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolution 385 (1976)  is also necessary in the case of Namibia. The mediatory effort of the five Western Powers requires for its success that the world Organization should be prepared to act decisively at this stage. It is the leg3l and moral responsibility of the United Nations to supervise Namibia's transition to independence with the full participation of the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people  namely  the South West Africa People s Organization. We must also make it clear that the armed forces of South Africa have no right to be present in Namibia  nor is there any legal title for South Africa's retention of Walvis Bay.190.	Apartheid and minority rule in South Africa are indeed at the heart of the crisis in southern Africa  and it is in this very bastion that the struggle is being waged most tenaciously. The Lagos Conference marks a further important success for the African peoples and nations in their long struggle against apartheid It is a struggle based on the highest principles of humanity  which Pakistan has supported with every means at its disposal  and we continue to express our strongest solidarity with the African peoples in their fight against the vicious doctrine and practice of apartheid.191.	Events in South Africa are indeed coming to a head. The death  while in police custody  of Steven Biko is only the latest in a series of actions that can only be described as official murders. These actions demonstrate the brutal and inhumane nature of the South African regime. They symbolize the bravery and determination of those who oppose it. They also foretell their inevitable and ultimate triumph.192.	Pakistan shares the growing concern with regard to human rights. It does not seem appropriate or fair  however  selectively to single out certain situations and to ignore even graver violations elsewhere. Nor can concern for the rights of individuals within States be permitted to diminish the tempo of the movement for the realization of the collective rights of peoples. The first priority must remain to secure equal rights and self-determination for oppressed peoples and to ensure the basic necessities for a life of dignity to the impoverished masses of the third world.193.	It is tragic that in this era of technological miracles  the international community has been unable to provide for even the minimum needs of nearly half of humanity. The enormous gap in living standards between the rich and the poor is growing each day. According to World Bank projections  during the decade ending in 1985 the annual per capita incomes of the developed countries are expected to grow by $2 600 as against a mere $30 for the poor countries.194.	Despite the adoption of the International Development Strategy  the Declaration and Programme of Action on the New International Economic Order and the consensus of the seventh special session  very little has been done in concrete terms to meet the pressing problems of the third world  and nothing to rectify the underlying causes. The agreements reached at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation were limited both in scope and substance. The 18 months of negotiations in Paris reflected the continuing divergence between the declarations and the actions of the developed countries. The resumed thirty-first session was unable to agree even on a common evaluation of the results of the Paris Conference.195.	Indeed  the policies of the developed countries have registered a marked regression. Aid levels have stagnated at less than half the agreed target; the distribution of international financial reserves remains as inequitable as ever; and there is an ominous trend towards protectionism apparent in the developed countries. This  together with spiralling import prices  an alarming debt burden  imported inflation and depressed commodity markets have confronted the poorest countries with large financial deficits and reduced their already marginal growth rates. Their balance-of-payments deficits now amount to $10 billion  and per capita incomes do not grow by more than 2 to 3 per cent. Solutions to these problems must be found if economic and political disruption is to be averted over a large area of the world.196.	The developing countries have increasingly come to recognize that their salvation lies in a collective endeavour to promote economic co-operation and to strengthen their own unity and solidarity. Pakistan is convinced that both these objectives can be significantly advanced through a summit meeting of the developing countries.197.	The foreign ministers of the developing countries are to meet in the next two days to consider  among other things  the means of reviving the momentum in the North-South dialogue. We believe that the General Assembly at its current session should identify the key areas in which progress should be made and evolve guidelines for the forthcoming negotiations to be held in various international bodies. In our view  urgent action is imperative in the areas of the transfer of resources  debt  monetary reform  trade in commodities and manufactures  the transfer of technology and industrialization.198.	In the Programme of Action towards the goal of a more equitable system of international economic relations  the transfer of technology from the developed to the developing nations is of crucial importance. No country should be hindered in choosing for itself the kind of technology that is appropriate to its needs. It is  therefore  a matter of concern that during the last two years the London Club has devised unilateral restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology  particularly to the developing countries. At two recent scientific conferences held at Persepolis and at Salzburg  it was the general consensus that nuclear energy was competitive with the other sources of energy and that it was vitally needed by countries deficient in fossil fuels. It was also recognized that those countries embarking on nuclear power programmes must be able to count on the timely availability of adequate supplies of nuclear fuel and the services of the nuclear fuel cycle in order to assure a degree of independence from energy imports. FORATO - that is  the European Atomic Forum —took the lead to asserting that: ... an economic use of nuclear fuels by means of recycling  reprocessing and advanced reactors representsfor most [of the European countries] not  only assets but a real need which they cannot renounce .FORATOM went on to say that this was all the more important economic progress in the developingcountries.199.	The danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons does not arise from those countries that have submitted their facilities to IAEA safeguards. The danger arises from those other countries which do not have safeguarded nuclear fuel cycle facilities. Yet  it is not these threshold nuclear-weapon Powers that are the focus of attention. Paradoxically  it is the countries that accept international safeguards that are the target of a policy of pressure and discriminatory restraints. Demands have been made that agreements and contracts relating to the transfer of nuclear technology  even though subject to the most stringent international safeguards  should be abrogated or renegotiated.200.	In some cases the nuclear suppliers have unilaterally terminated supplies and services in violation of their solemn undertakings  threatening to shut down essential services facilities or to abandon their completion  as a form of pressure to secure compliance with their demands.201.	The repudiation of binding contracts would not only erode confidence in the sanctity of international agreements  but would create the most serious reservations in the minds of the developing countries. There is no justification for denying to the poor nations what the rich nations find no reason to deny to themselves. If countries with abundant reserves of coal  gas and oil cannot renounce reprocessing and recycling  is it right and just to force the developing countries which lack such conventional sources of energy to renounce for all time the possibility of benefiting from the nuclear fuel cycle?202.	This is the issue facing Pakistan  a developing country seriously deficient in fossil fuels and therefore in need of developing its peaceful nuclear power programme. It has contracted for the acquisition of a small reprocessing plant under the strictest possible safeguards  which have been approved by the IAEA. Pakistan has no nuclear facilities outside international inspection  unlike certain other countries which possess entirely unsafeguarded nuclear cycles. Pakistan's record in the observance of safeguards is impeccable. Pakistan's efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime established by the non-proliferation Treaty are well-known. Also  Pakistan was the prime mover in the convening of the Conference of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States. It is the proponent of the move to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia which would free the entire  region from the danger of proliferation. It has sought to strengthen the security of the non-nuclear States and to reduce the inducement for them to acquire the nuclear option. Consequently  there is no danger of proliferation from Pakistan.203.	The twin objectives of harnessing nuclear energy in the service of mankind and at the same time preventing its diversion to military purposes can and must be fully reconciled. My delegation would suggest that at its current session  the General Assembly approve a set of principles for the transfer of nuclear technology and facilities for peaceful purposes. These could include the following: international co-operation to ensure the optimum use of nuclear energy for power generation and other peaceful applications; the determination by each State  without15 Hold at Geneva from 29 August to 28 September 1968.external interference  of its own nuclear energy needs and programmes; the application of universally determined and accepted safeguards to the nuclear facilities of non-nuclear States; non-discrimination in the conditions for the supply of nuclear equipment and technology to recipient States; and respect for the sanctity of international agreements and contracts.204.	The proposals for the creation of nuclear-weapon- free zones in Africa  the Middle East and South Asia have acquired even greater urgency in view of the reported preparations by South Africa to explode a nuclear device. No less immediate is the danger in the Middle East and in South Asia. We  therefore  urge the major nuclear Powers and their allies to adopt a more positive position on these proposals.205.	At its thirty-first session  the General Assembly called for consultations among the States of South Asia with a view to establishing a nuclear free zone in the region. Despite the willingness of most of the regional States to enter into such consultations  a meeting for this purpose has not yet been found possible. We have noted the declarations of Prime Minister Desai of India  expressing a commitment not to develop nuclear weapons. For our part  we have always felt that this commitment and those given by the other States of South Asia need to be embodied in a formal multilateral instrument. Our proposal for the establishment of a South Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone offers complete assurance against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.206.	More resolute action is also required to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. The stability of this vital area cannot but be affected by the military presence of outside Powers and the encouragement of hegemonic tendencies within the region. The creation of a zone of peace would therefore require the elimination of both these dangers as well as the prohibition of nuclear weapons from the area. We note that the super-Powers have initiated bilateral consultations on the subject of their military presence in the Indian Ocean. We believe  however  that full consultations on this entire question should take place in the Ad Hoc Committee with the participation of all the States concerned.207.	The ever growing nuclear arsenals of the two superpowers pose the gravest threat to international peace and security. While we note that the United States and the USSR will do nothing incompatible with the Agreement reached at the first round of the SALT talks after it expires in the next few days  we are concerned that the Vladivostok agreements are yet to be translated into an accord at the second round of the SALT talks. Nor have the two super-Powers come to grips with the crucial problem of actual reductions in their nuclear-weapon stockpiles and delivery systems. We cannot but express our disappointment that they have not yet been able  even 10 years after their solemn pledge in the non-proliferation Treaty  to bring about nuclear disarmament. The proposal put forward by President Carter in this forum on 17 March for deep reductions in the nuclear offensive systems of each side  was  in our view  praiseworthy in the spirit of its general approach. Any agreement would  of course  need to respect the central principle that each step of nuclear disarmament is not to the advantage of one side or at the expense of the other. So we note with satisfaction from Foreign Minister Gromyko's statement of this morning [8th meeting] that the Soviet Union for its part has found it possible to come forward with its proposals for actual reductions of such weapon systems.208.	Pakistan has consistently endeavoured to strengthen the non-proliferation regime established by the Treaty on the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and by Security Council resolution 255 (1968) on security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States. The two instruments constitute an integral whole. Since that time  we have tried our best to focus attention on the imperative need to strengthen this Security Council resolution in order to make the assurances more credible. As a result of efforts extending over a decade  Pakistan was able to promote  at the last session of the General Assembly  a wide measure of consensus on a resolution putting forward a specific formula. We would again urge the nuclear Powers to give serious consideration  as invited by this resolution  to extending an undertaking not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against those non-nuclear States which are not parties to the nuclear security arrangements of some nuclear Powers.209.	The Charter of the United Nations conceives of a just and stable structure of international peace and security built on the universal principles of sovereign equality and independence of States. Such a structure of peace is incompatible with hegemony or assertions of regional predominance. In this context I cannot help but deprecate statements which seek to confer pre-eminent status to one or the other country in this or that region. The award of such a role clearly undermines the principle of sovereign equality upon which relations between States  large or small  are based. Far from contributing to stability in South Asia  such doctrines do a disservice to the process of reconciliation and peace. My delegation feels that the forthcoming special session on disarmament should  in its declaration  commit all States to eschew attempts at domination of any kind.210.	The policy of selective denial of arms will merely aggravate military imbalances  and will heighten a sense of insecurity in those countries which are adversely affected. Regional tensions and instability are the almost inevitable consequence. We believe that a coherent and even-handed policy of restricting arms sales should not be divorced from the indigenous military production capability of the recipient State. Armaments  whether produced at home or imported from abroad  serve precisely the same purpose. A great majority of developing countries do not manufacture defence equipment themselves. Equal restrictions on arms transfer to these countries could have an unequal effect and leave them virtually defenseless.211.	The forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament provides the opportunity not only to formulate a political declaration and action programme but also to achieve some meaningful agreements on specific proposals for limitation and control of armaments and disarmament on a global as well as a regional basis. The special session can also serve to strengthen the non-proliferation regime established by the non-proliferation Treaty. To these ends  the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament should  in our opinion  address itself inter alia to concrete measures such as creation of zones of peace and of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa  the Middle East  South Asia and the South-West Pacific; formulation of credible security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States; and the promotion of regional negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction of military forces  armaments and expenditures.212.	In case the special session of the Assembly fails to reach some concrete agreements on these issues  it may become necessary to consider the reconvening of the Conference of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States to consider measures by which their security can be safeguarded in the nuclear era.213.	The world situation continues to be dominated by the challenge of unfulfilled hopes. It presents a picture of striking contrasts. Colonial empires have fallen to the forces of freedom. But political independence has not assured the emergent nations full control over their destiny. These nations remain subject to an inequitable economic system which was designed to serve the aims of domination and exploitation. Their security is constantly exposed to the pulls and pressures of the politics of power.214.	The promise held out by the Charter of a community of nations acting collectively to safeguard peace and promote prosperity throughout the world still remains a distant goal. This promise can—and it must-be realized. Those States which possess greater power have the greatest obligation to work towards a just and stable world order. Their policies and actions  if inspired by a vision of an interdependent world  can make an immense contribution to the realization of this objective. Yet  it is always the weak and the dispossessed who must struggle for change. Thus  the countries of the third world  too  have an equal responsibility to bring to bear their distinctive contribution to the collective efforts for a better world.215.	Pakistan is committed to this objective of a democratic and equitable world order. We shall continue to work actively for this goal within and outside the United Nations. 	"

This also means that peace and security for anyone can only be the product of a universal effort in which everyone  small or big  participates on the basis .of equality and of equal sovereignty  and when the truly vital rights of every country  however small  are equally respected and its grievances equally attended to.""Mr. President  those are your words; you said that in 1973 in my country where you also represented a nation to which the cause of non-alignment owes so much. Those words express your progressive philosophy and your enthusiasm for the democratization of international relations  and they suffice to explain why Panama and all the countries of the third world are so deeply and sincerely happy at your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.185.	The unanimous admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations is  at once  an act of justice and a world-wide recognition of what can be achieved despite tremendous obstacles by the courage  determination and dignity of a country on the road to freedom and nationhood. We also rejoice because of the admission of the young Republic of Djibouti; we wish it uninterrupted prosperity and progress. These are auspicious signs for the work now being guided by you at this thirty-second session.186.	Further  we wish  on behalf of the delegation of Panama  to applaud Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who is so highly esteemed by all delegations  for his wise presidency of the previous session.187.	I would wish to express  on behalf of our delegation  the pleasure we share with the Spanish-speaking world because of the Nobel Prize conferred last night on Vicente Aleixandre  a Spanish poet. This really is recognition of vital importance of the so-called ""generation of 1927"" in Spanish culture.188.	On the American continent  it is only fair to say that events have occurred which no doubt will contribute to the establishment of an atmosphere of cordiality  friendship and understanding among the countries of the region  which will also be reflected in the enthusiastic contribution which the Latin American countries will make to the work of the General Assembly. I refer to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977  and the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal  signed in Washington on 7 September 19 /7 by the President of the United States of America  Jimmy Carter  and by the Head of the Government of the Republic of Panama  Omar Torrijos  as well as the Declaration of Washington of the same date signed by the States Members of the Organization of American States and the Prime Minister of Canada.189.	As the culmination of a lengthy process of negotiation  the United States and Panama have arrived at a basic arrangement on the question of the Panama Canal  with the purpose of eliminating the causes of conflict which have cast a shadow over relations between the United States and Panama and Latin America over the past 75 years.190.	The friendly agreement embodied in these treaties is due to the tenacious and constant campaign of the people of Panama  encouraged over the last years by the anti- colonialist attitude of General Omar Torrijos Herrera. Also  it is fair to recognize that it is also due to the democratic spirit and honest conscience of President Jimmy Carter  which finally rendered null and void the monstrous Hay-Bunau-Varilla Convention of 1903  that no Panamanian signed. That Convention  which was only voted later by people enchained by its arbitrary clauses  mortgaged forever the major natural resource of Panama.191.	The Carter-Torrijos treaties constitute a pact on a fixed-term basis  which recognizes the effective sovereignty of Panama over the whole of its territory and ensures the recovery of its jurisdiction over the Canal Zone within a period of not more than three years  assures the United States  as well as all other countries of the world  access for their ships to an open and neutral canal ""on terms of entire equality"".192.	In the same treaties  the Republic of Panama  as the sovereign territory  grants the United States a concession for the management  operation and maintenance of the Panama Canal for a period of 22 years.193.	The new contractual relations agreed to between Panama and the United States on 7 September 1977 appear in two Treaties  3 related agreements  10 annexes  3 ""Agreed Acts""  52 descriptive maps  2 navigation charts  9 exchanges of notes and 1 multilateral declaration.194.	Article IV of the Panama Canal Treaty provides  inter alia  that:""The Republic of Panama and the United States of America commit themselves to protect and defend the Panama Canal. Each Party shall act  in accordance with its constitutional processes  to meet the danger resulting from an armed attack or other actions which threaten the security of the Panama Canal or of ships transiting it.""195.	But the vital fact  the irrevocable hope of successive generations of Panamanians  is that on 31 December 1999  the military presence of the United States on Panamanian territory will physically cease. The full historical significance of that fact is enshrined in the Treaties signed on 7 September last  because it is this military presence which in itself limits and undermines Panamanian nationality. It is not a matter of friendship or enmity between nations. What is at stake is the very essence of our national feeling  which has nothing to do with possible tactical or defensive alliances aimed at a specific objective and limited  therefore  by circumstances and other transitory factors.196.	Status as a nation and  as a vital part of it  sovereignty which is its greatest attribute are essentially antagonistic to ? foreign military presence within the national territory  particularly when that presence is one of the mightiest Powers in the history of the world. Specifically because of its weight  such a presence weighs unfavourably  albeit in a friendly and non-aggressive manner  on the soul of the people where it exists  with all that that tacitly implies for the social  political and economic existence of that people. That military presence in the case of Panama  because of the total disproportion of the two parties  is a hegemonic influence to be fought against from day to day at every level of daily life  to prevent the people from the experience of becoming outcasts  so that the nation will not become some -hybrid  bastard country bearing no relation to its proper historical  ethnic and cultural traditions.197.	As for the near future  Panama is aware of its responsibilities and is prepared to take over the tasks of operating  administering-and defending the inter-oceanic waterway. To do that  we have as a base of support the human capital represented by the Panamanians  who comprise 75 per cent of the labour force employed by the Panama Canal Company. Benefiting from the progress and the growing development of our educational system and professional resources offered by universities  my country has started to train the necessary technical staff. Furthermore  we are constantly increasing the number of scholarship students in the large technological training centres abroad. At the same time  as regards the defence of national sovereignty and territorial integrity  a major mission will be carried out by the new graduating class of our national military institute ""Tomas Herrera""  where  encouraged by the nationalistic spirit of the National Guard of Panama  thousands of young men are being trained in accordance with the new democratic concept which -will be the most distinguishing factor of the armed forces of the continent.198.	I must now make special reference to the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.199.	My country is conscious of the importance of the Panama Canal as an international waterway for world navigation and wishes to invite the attention of Member States of the United Nations to the following  most important provision in article II of that Treaty:""The Republic of Panama declares the neutrality of the Canal in order that both in time of peace and in time of war it shall remain secure and open to peaceful transit by the vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality  so that there will be no discrimination against any nation  or its citizens or subjects  concerning the conditions or charges of transit  or for any other reason  and so that the Canal  and therefore the Isthmus of Panama  shall not be the target of reprisals in any armed conflict between other nations of the world.""13200.	In order to perfect the regime of permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal  the contracting parties  under article VII  undertake to open for signature by all the States of the world a protocol whereby the signatory States would make the neutral regime of the Panama Canal universal.201.	The protocol of the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal would be an invitation to ail States of the world to give universal validity to the regime of neutrality to which both countries have agreed will govern the inter-oceanic waterway  so as to ensure permanent access to the Canal for the ships of every nation on the basis of complete equality.202.	In compliance with that commitment  this protocol will be open to access by all States of the world from the date of its ratification and will for each State enters into force from the time it deposits its instrument of accession with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States.203.	The international instruments to which I have just referred are subject to the constitutional procedures of ratification by both parties: in the United States  with the assent of two thirds of the members of the Senate present at the time; in Panama by a majority vote expressed in a national plebiscite.204.	What is of particular significance in this respect is the Washington Declaration signed by the highest officials of the States members of the Organization of American States and by the Prime Minister of Canada  concurred in by a large majority of Heads of States o* Government of the region  on the initiative of President Carter. That Declaration represents a new era in hemispheric relations and imprints a seal of continental solidarity on the new Panama Canal Treaties.205.	The Washington Declaration not only paves the way towards establishing a new international economic order in the Latin American developing countries  but is also a positive contribution to peace  security and progress for mankind by recognizing the importance for all States of the world of arrangements to ensure the accessibility and the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal.206.	The lengthy process of negotiation which was carried out during the last 13 years has been justified before national and international public opinion as the peaceful means to set in motion the process of decolonization in Panama. The negotiations had to culminate in a formula of decolonization to put an end to the colonial enclave embedded in the heart of the territory of Panama.207.	To arrive at that goal  the Government of Panama assigned in the vanguard of our diplomatic front a group of negotiators to serve as spokesman for our national conscience. The agreements reached must be understood in their entirety as a formula for decolonization which is viable and acceptable to both Governments  and which is now subject to the scrutiny  review and approval of both peoples in accordance with their constitutional procedures.208.	It is an act of justice to recognize the patriotism  ability and devotion of the Panamanian negotiators who participated in the negotiations on the new Treaties. Also  equal devotion  ability and patriotism must be recognized as belonging to other citizens who had equally intense Panamanian feelings but who expressed disquiet  impatience or disagreement  or who disagreed wholly or in part with what is contained in the new Treaties.209.	The right to assent or dissent  a basic pillar for harmonizing human relations around national interests in modern States  is recognized as the very essence of the plebiscite to be held in Panama. The alternative is clear. Those who consider that the new Treaties constitute a suitable formula for decolonization will approve them. Those who believe the contrary will reject them. The results  whose genuineness can be endorsed by the United Nations  we!' bear witness to the desire of the people of Panama for self-determination.210.	Precisely in order that there should be no doubt of that right to dissent within the broad popular support of his administration  the Head of Government of Panama  General Omar Torrijos Herrera  has requested a United Nations presence during the plebiscite on the new Treaties. It is of the utmost significance for my country that the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has agreed to send a mission to Panama headed by a personal representative  to be present during the verification of the national plebiscite  which has been scheduled by la number 33 of 13 September 1977 to be held on 23 October 1977 compliance with the provision? of article 274 of our National Constitution.211.	In this consultation with the people  Panamanian citizens will decide whether or not they approve the new Panama Canal Treaty  the treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama and the annexed documents  which were signed on 7 September in Washington.212.	In addition to the Treaties on the Panama Canal are operative in regard to decolonization  ""the settlement of the Panama Canal issue""  as it is stated in the Washington Declarations ""represents a major step toward strengthening of relations among the nations of the Western Hemisphere on a basis of common interest  equality and mutual respect for the sovereignty and independence of every state"".213.	The Ihmian Cam Convention of 1903  better known as the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty  imposed in perpetuity on the Republic of Panama to ensure construction by the United States of the waterway  is the only instrument still in force of the three ominous treaties designed to mortgage the existence of Latin American States whose territories were considered to be cross-roads for the major world maritime routes.214.	The ""La Mesilla"" Treaty concerning the border between the Republic of Mexico and the United States  signed at Mexico City on 30 December 18S3  which assured on an indefinite basis free transit for the army of the United States through the Tehuantepec Isthmus  was abrogated by the joint action of those two great statesmen  Lazaro Cardenas and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Bryan-Chamorro Treaty between Nicaragua and the United States granted the latter country in perpetuity the right to build an inter-oceanic canal by way of the San Juan River and the great lake of Nicaragua and was abrogated in 1971 by the Heads of Government of the two countries  Richard Nixon and Anastasio Somoza.215.	The Government of Panama has gone beyond the mere holding of a plebiscite by inviting a United Nations presence. On 13 September  the Head of Government  General Omar Torrijos Herrera  addressed a telegram to Mr. Andres Aguilar  Chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  staging that ""the new Canal treaties are a symbol to the world of our desire to eliminate discrimination and injustice""  and invited that Commission to visit Panama and report on the actual enjoyment of human rights there.216.	The statement by Torrijos in that document emphasizes the will of the Government of Panama fully to implement the exercise of fundamental human rights among the inhabitants of the Republic in every part of the country. It also reflects the decision to promote; the effective functioning  within the jurisdiction of the Panamanian State  of the legal  regional and world mechanism established to make human rights effective.217.	That is an isolated attitude. The immediate precedent the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which was adopted in 1948 by this Assembly  is to be found in the first draft on this question submitted to the General Assembly by the head of the delegation of Panama  Mr. Ricardo J. Alfaro. The ratification by Panama in 1976 of the International Covenant on Economic  Social arid Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  as well as the Optional Protocol thereto  was decisive in having those human rights Covenants proclaimed by the United Nations enter into force during that same year 1976. It was therefore possible to establish the Human Rights Committee  which affords an unprecedented procedure for the consideration of communications from persons who denounce human rights violations committed by States parties to the Protocol.218.	The Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903  considered by many jurists as a political mortgage  as an anachronism  as a social fossil  will be abrogated in Panama when there is an exchange of the ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977.219.	Panama  deprived until now of both its ports of entry to the Canal  has not been able to comply fully with its Bolivarian destiny to assist the sister republics of Latin America to implement the major integration plans of the founders of the republics of our hemisphere. Thus it can be understood how the 1903 Treaty has so far been a barrier to the unity  integration and accelerated economic development of Panama and of Latin America.220.	The origins and clauses of that Treaty have been so hateful that a distinguished historian from Argentina in his historical outline ""From the Panama Congress to the Panama Canal"" went so far as to say:''The programme which Bolivar started in Panama in 1826 came to an end in 1903 also in Panama  which wastransformed from the cradle to the grave of the Bolivarian standard.""221.	But Panama is and will continue to be a pedestal and not a tomb for the ideals of the Liberator.222.	Bolivar  who made of the isthmus of Panama the centre of his ideals and affection  thought of the city of Panama as a capital for the Great Latin American Fatherland. Referring to the Act of Independence of Panama from Spain in 1821  he exclaimed:""I cannot find words to express my joy and admiration for learning that Panama  the centre of the universe  is by itself brought back to life and freed by its own endeavours. The Act of Independence of Panama is the most glorious monument that any American province can offer to history. Everything is contained therein: justice  generosity  national policy and interest.""223.	As host to the Amphictyonic Congress of 1826  the nation of Panama  despite every vicissitude  has never failed to be loyal to the programme of Bolivar for the unity and integration of Latin America. Its most recent achievements in this unifying and integrationist mission were enshrined by the constitution of the Latin American Economic System reached in 1975 by the ""Panama Convention""  and the establishment of the Latin American Export Bank. This last entity was formally established oil the initiative of Panama at the meeting of the Governors of the Central Banks of Latin America which was held this year in Guatemala City and which will start operating in Panama City with adequate financing from the region as an essential element for the sustained development of the Latin American countries.224.	Parallel with the Latin American movements born in the universities and in the major Latin American revolutions  new generations of Panamanians with a legacy of the ideals of all those who victoriously planted the standard of the liberator on the summit of Condorcunca have  without let or pause  pursued their arduous and lengthy road to battle for national claims and to redeem the historic mortgage incorporated in the 1903 Treaty. Among them and in the front line are the heroic teen-agers—the ""aguiluchos"" of the National Institute  as they are called in Panama-who in 1964 placed a cluster of Panamanian flags in the alienated Panama Canal zone and made it fertile with their blood. Together with them  are the students  teachers  professors  intellectual?  artists  the workers in the cities and in the fields  men and women of every age who have at all times responded to the national call and who are ultimately the Panamanian best entitled to judge what is just and proper in the new Treaties and their annexes.225.	Of course  from a pure  extreme and radical national perspective  some aspects of the new Treaties are not satisfactory. But  nationalities are not fully forged overnight  or by a single generation or group of individuals. Along the way towards the full attainment of a national Panamanian personality  there are obstacles and vicissitudes. To rise above them is the task of this generation and future generations  which must complete the work of the present one.226.	Precisely because of this collective struggle  this joint effort made by people of diverse ages and tendencies called together in this higher level of every civic debate Is the element which  in itself  creates national unity for our national interest. Without national unity progress is made difficult. It is difficult to administer public affairs  and the supreme objective of a fully sovereign nation becomes distant in the perspective of time. It is obvious that among its positive advantages  the debate on the question of the new Panama Canal Treaties brings with it the promising possibility for national unity among the vast majority of the progressive forces of the country.227.	In the light of this perspective we have to take into account international circumstances. The Secretary- General  as the eternal champion of good causes  already said so in his report on the work of the Organization. He said:""I know  very well that a miraculous and sudden transformation to a new and better world order is inconceivable. I do  however  believe that we must try  in all our activities  to facilitate and accelerate the evolutionary process by which the relations of Governments in all important matters will be regulated -and harmonized with the long-term interests of the world community. Thus  we are living at a time when there are military alliances  large power blocs from which few nations can be free  despite their own power. Fortunately  the spectre of a possible intercontinental conflict becomes ever more remote because of the paradoxical effect of the progress of the technology of war  the balance of terror  and so it may be assumed that the neutrality and operation of the Canal will not He threatened. A promising augury of this is that the Government of President Carter has signed Additional Protocol I of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). But this is all for the future  for new groups of men and generations.228.	The Torrijos-Carter Treaties  viewed not only as a formula of decolonization but also as a pilot plan for international co-operation between Panama and the United States with a view to improving hemispheric relations  could be a decisive factor in accelerating the integration and unity of Latin America.229.	This new type of hemispheric relations can only prosper harmoniously  however  by complete compliance with the principles which are deeply rooted in the conscience of the peoples of this region and today enshrined in contemporary international law  such as respect for the territorial integrity and the independence of States  non-intervention by a State in the internal affairs of another State  self-determination of peoples  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the renunciation of the use or threat of force  the sovereign equality of States  and the application of fundamental human rights.230.	I would not wish to end without referring to an opposition which an arrangement in the Panama Canal question arouses in some circles in the United States. As was rightly said by Mr. Shridath Ramphal  Secretary- General of the British Commonwealth of Nations:.. to those in the councils of the United States... who urge that strategic interests should prevail over those principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity which are now part of the heritage of this hemisphere  let it be recalled that no way has ever yet been held-be it overland route or mountain pass or navigable straits-in defiance of the will of those who dwell around it.""231.	There are some who  with repeated obstinacy  seek to confuse the concept of the neutrality and the defence of the inter-oceanic way with that of intervention; but intervention has become a dirty word to the Latin American peoples who have suffered and have learned hard lessons from history. It may be said that the provision of international law which is most deeply rooted in the thoughts and feelings of the Latin American peoples is the principle of non-intervention. This has been the basis of relations between the United States and Latin America since in Montevideo in 1933 and Buenos Aires in 1936 the great North American Power renounced the principle of intervention by subscribing to the Declaration of the nations of the hemisphere  to the effect that direct or indirect intervention in internal or external affairs is inadmissible. The United States committed itself  in the event of violation of those principles  to joint consultations with the aim of arriving at a peaceful solution.232.	The United States  as a State party to the Charter of the Organization of American States and to the Charter of the United Nations  is committed to enforcing this principle at the regional level and throughout the world.233.	The Agreement in Implementation of Article IV of the Panama Canal Treaty strictly refers to defence against the danger of an armed attack or other action that might threaten the security of the Panama Canal or of the ships transiting it. This is not  nor can it be  a treaty to regulate the capacity for reciprocal aggression of the parties.234.	Logically the Treaty refers to third States which might commit acts or threats of aggression against the Panama Canal and the freedom of navigation through it. To confuse this situation with the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of Panama is to distort a specific clause  vitiating its semantic  political and legal value. This is totally unacceptable to the international community.235.	Here  of course  we are entering the field of moral assumptions because no one in this Assembly is unaware that  if the great Powers were to succumb to the temptation to abandon respect for ethical and legal rules  there is no public treaty or provision of international law which could stop them.236.	No country can proclaim itself the world champion of the rule of law and the freedom of the citizen claiming that it stands in the forefront of international democracy and is' the defender of the sovereignty of peoples and upholder of peace while  at the same time  suspending those principles in the case of small countries which  like mine  can only oppose force with the deep legal and moral conviction of a David defending his elementary rights.241. The words I have the honour to address to this august Assembly on behalf of my Government and my delegation would be incomplete and lacking in an elementary sense of justice were I not to express the gratitude of the Government and people of Panama for the decisive support they have received from the world community  and particularly from the sister republics of Latin America andthose nations which constitute the majestic group of the non-aligned. Their support for the Panamanian cause  that has been given unstintingly  has been repeatedly demonstrated within this Organization. When the history of this time is written  when the problems now being confronted by the United Nations are resolved  when the balance sheet has been drawn up showing its actions and influence on world events  it will then be seen that the cause of Panama was one of the decisive proofs of the importance and beneficial action of this ecumenical assembly of free nations."
"101",5514,"PER",32,1977,"﻿132.	 Mr. President  it is a special pleasure for me. as Foreign Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Peru  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly since it has brought to that distinguished post a representative of Yugoslavia  a non-aligned country and a friend of Peru  and ensures that our discussions will take place under the most impartial leadership and in a manner commensurate with the international responsibility of the present time.133.	The sure progress of our world Organization under the direction of Secretary-General Kurt Waldehim is an indication that the international community  despite undeniable difficulties  is approaching a consensus among the States which will make it possible for the principles of the Charter to be fully implemented in the foreseeable future. For that reason it is a great pleasure for me to welcome the Governments of Viet Nam and Djibouti  which now join the United Nations as new Members and which by their presence and efforts will contribute to the strengthening of peace.134.	On this occasion afforded to me by the General Assembly I shall limit my statement to the minimum  taking into account the importance of stating the concerns  interests and position of my Government as regards present-day problems but at the same time recognizing the urgency of leading this debate to subjects which in my view may demand special priority and attention.135.	It is with this idea and procedure in mind that I have distributed the complete text of my statement in which I have dealt appropriately with the items of interest and which I hope will be analysed thoroughly in the Foreign Ministries.136.	Naturally  among the complex international topics my country must emphasize those which relate most directly to our international action by giving a detailed picture of our regional concerns and at the same time explaining the situation which obtains in Peru at the moment. This should not be construed as meaning that we are placing in another perspective problems of global import since we are also concerned about them.137.	First of all  I believe it essential to face objectively the meagre results of the North-South dialogue because the conclusion of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation seems to make an over-all solution impossible in a world which persists in its fragmentation despite its interdependent nature. It inevitable that in evaluating that forum for negotiation  to which Peru contributed its best efforts  the end result appears to be clearly negative. The responsibility for this rests with the industrialized countries which disregarded our substantive positions without proposing alternative structural formulas. Temporary proposals for financial relief do not constitute a significant factor in a process of negotiation which really extends to another level.138.	On the other hand  we have before us an opportunity to follow new North-South co-ordinates  together with the continuous efforts in the economic debate  at the appropriate levels and in the forums in which decisions can be made  by implementing a comprehensive programme of disarmament under international supervision. This cannot be postponed further if we wish to remove the burden on the world economy represented by the arms race and to free new resources for use in international economic co-operation.139.	As regards the law of the sea  I wish to say that when the United Nations Conference on this subject approaches its goal there will be pitfalls which may lead to a resounding failure. On the one hand there are attempts to change the jurisdiction of coastal States over the maritime areas adjacent to their coasts which are affected by the essentially codifying nature of work in this field. On the other hand there are the difficult negotiations on the sea-bed  which are politically explosive and methodologically bogged down and have been further hampered by threats of unilateral action or simply of abandonment  which jeopardizes what is a common heritage of mankind.140.	From our vantage point and bearing in mind the most pressing objectives which the non-aligned developing countries agree in presenting as inescapable immediate responsibilities  we are concerned by the fact that  far from noting a promising climate in the most critical areas of international security  we see rather that there is little to give rise to optimism in southern Africa  Cyprus or the Middle East. My country has adopted clear and definite positions on these problems and continues to believe that the progress of negotiations must encompass the rights and interests of populations which have been oppressed and cast aside so as to obtain in each of the situations of conflict real changes which will make it possible not only to eliminate the risks for the maintenance of peace but also to develop the just and equitable formulas which are the essential condition of permanent solutions.141.	The consistent objectives of Peruvian foreign policy have led my Government to Jake more effective action in terms of strengthening its close ties with the brother nations of Latin America  and at the level of Heads of State we have reaffirmed our permanent support for the just cause of Panama in claiming its national rights in the Canal Zone  and have reiterated the political commitment to strengthen the integration of the Andean Group. At the same time  at the highest level and in the same spirit of brotherhood  we have been acts to continue dealing with bilateral questions which are part of the constructive relations we have with neighbouring countries with a view to strengthening permanent bonds of peace and solidarity.142.	The interest of Peru in promoting and strengthening regional unity is aimed at ensuring that Latin America will have increasing representation in future discussions for the purpose of establishing juster and sounder bases for a democratically established order among nations which will guarantee human rights and man's fulfilment.143.	The idea supported by the Heads of State of the Andean Group at their meeting in Washington on 8 September last of holding a world conference on inflation is eloquent proof of the continuous concern of my country about the most pressing problems facing the international community.!43. Peru has constantly expanded its integrationist interests because it believes that it is right and necessary to create bonds of unity in the continent and appropriate institutional forms as additional steps towards eradicating the disputes which still exist in the subcontinent. This action in favour of unity  especially in the context of the Bolivarian countries of the Andean Group  has just received  at the meeting of Presidents in Washington  decisive support  which augurs well for its success.144.	In the same spirit of understanding which expresses our sincere desire for peace  the meeting recently held in Washington by the Presidents of Peru and Ecuador was particularly heartening. In that cordial encounter both Heads of State examined bilateral matters  especially the more delicate and important ones  without excluding any questions affecting relations between the two countries. The consideration of those questions is to proceed through friendly dialogue and direct contacts between Peru and Ecuador.145.	In that same spirit  I should like to refer to the support repeatedly expressed by Peru of Bolivia's desire for an outlet to the sea. Peru responded to the initial approaches made to it by presenting a proposal which ensured Bolivia's access to the sea and at the same time included additional elements that  in its view  could lead to conditions guaranteeing peace  co-operation and development in the area where that access is to be provided. Peru does not pretend to view its proposal as a final and definitive formula  but rather as a basis for negotiations which my country believes should be inspired by a determination to achieve an over-all solution of the problems.146.	At this session of the Assembly the Foreign Minister of Bolivia referred to Peru's consent to a possible solution. Our position is that  to be logical  Peru cannot consider giving its consent before it is provided with the basis of an agreement between Bolivia and Chile  which so far has not been arrived at. Once that is done contacts between Peru and Chile will be established in order to reach the prior agreement between the parties  as provided for in the Additional Protocol of 1929.147.	This order of events  however  does not prevent the three countries from holding constructive talks with a view to facilitating a solution of the problem  bearing in mind their respective interests.148.	Proof of that is the fact that the Foreign Ministers of Bolivia and Chile and myself held talks today in compliance with the solemn mandate given to us by our Presidents on 8 September in Washington  which will allow for continuing dialogue not only through the Foreign Ministers but also through special representatives who will smooth the way  constructively and dynamically for future meetings of Foreign Ministers. The press release resulting from that important meeting will be distributed to the Assembly tomorrow.149.	I should like now to refer to the positive situation with respect to the Revolutionary Government today with its decision to accelerate the process which will in a short period of time lead to the establishment of complete democracy in Peru. Next year a constituent assembly will be held and a new constitution will be adopted which  with the transfer of power in 1980  will lead to a genuinely democratic political system and the enactment of rules which will ensure the permanent nature of the reforms carried out in my country.150.	Those steps  which will include greater party involvement and greater participation of the masses in the national dialogue  indicate that the Government of Peru knows how to build a political system which guarantees essential economic and social rights together with full political freedom. Compliance with that will confirms and reaffirms the humanitarian designs of my Government because  as the President of Peru  General Francisco Morales Bermudez  has stated: If it is not to struggle for the majority  if it is not to reduce the number of those who are cast aside and exploited  if it is not to increase he participation and distribution of wealth and power  if in short it is not to create a more humane and just society  then politics and democracy have no meaning and simply become a squalid struggle to satisfy personal ambitions. 151.	In the meantime  in the economic sector  my country has had to face adverse financial results which obstruct and jeopardize progress towards the advanced objectives of our development process now in full swing.152.	The situation I have described is the result not only of the public expenditure undertaken by the State in assuming primary responsibility for the development process but more importantly of the negative effects of the unfair structure of the world's economy  which has become worse as a result of the recession and the inflationary crisis. Another fact that is decisive in this negative picture is the sudden drastic drop in the prices of our raw materials and our exported commodities  which has had an adverse effect on our balance of payments.153.	Faced with these developments  my Government has decided to reduce public expenditure drastically  to promote domestic savings and to seek more realistic domestic price levels  without compromising the basic needs of the major sectors of the population  to whose improvement the process of change which the Revolutionary Government has initiated and is promoting is precisely directed. At the same time  my Government has decided to honour its external debt obligations  a practice which has constantly followed and one concerning which it hopes to find the necessary response in the financial community.154.	In briefly describing the present situation in Peru I have not wished to. perform an obligatory right but rather to show the interrelationship which exists between our domestic objectives and our international position. This is due to the full observance of a course of conduct which stems from a fundamental philosophy  that is to say  from adherence to principles of consultation and dialogue at the domestic level and to negotiation  understanding and co-operation at the international level. Peru believes that in both spheres a review of conditions of inequality and their restructuring are necessary in order to achieve the domestic and international norms of conduct which correspond to the fundamental requirements of man. "
"102",5561,"PHL",32,1977,"﻿150.	Mr. President  allow me first of all to extend to you the felicitations of my delegation on your highly-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your distinguished career as a diplomat in the service of your country  in advancing the principle of non-alignment and in developing constructive co-operation in the United Nations is the surest guarantee that the General Assembly will have the benefit of wise and effective leadership.151.	Permit me also to express our profound appreciation of the senses of our predecessor  Hamilton Shirley Amerasingh  who stored this Assembly wisely and well under trying circumstances.152.	And to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim we pay our sincere tribute for his numerous initiatives in the cause of peace.153.	We warmly welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti to our midst and extend to them the assurance of our friendly co-operation. The Philippines became one of the sponsors of the resolution on the admission of Viet Nam as a  sincere expression of our belief that the heroic people of Viet Nam has much to contribute to the peace and stability of South-East Asia and the world.154.	The world today is marked by confusion and contradiction. There are reasons for hope amid portents of disaster. There have been dialogue and confrontation  challenge and conciliation.155.	Plans for peace and the settlement of old conflicts are being patiently worked out in Namibia and Zimbabwe  while wars and threats of war overshadow other parts of Africa and Western and Eastern Asia.156.	In the Middle East  the Philippines is following with guarded optimism the progress of the effort to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East for the resumption of negotiations on the protracted conflict. A new spirit of conciliation and accommodation seems to move all parties to the dispute. We hope that enduring peace can finally be restored to this anguished region.157.	In another field  the industrialized countries are trying to maintain the momentum of their economic recovery  while the developing countries stagger and sink to their knees under a burden of debt now amounting to about $200 billion.158.	And in yet another sector  a European conference next month will review the progress in the implementation of the Helsinki accords. Today we seek to ask: is respect for human rights growing or withering away? Are detente and world security threatened by the development of more powerful and more accurate weapons of destruction? In sum  is our common condition getting better or is it getting worse?159.	The answers must be tentative and conjectural. They are likely to be contradictory and confusing  as  indeed  they have always been. But our attention may be profitably engaged in a recent development that promises to give this session a new and positive significance. This  we hope  is the changing attitude of nations towards one another.160.	In the past  as we well know  the General Assembly has been driven by partisan passion  the early ideological conflict between the East and the West  the rise to undoubted influence in this Assembly of a massive number of small nations  and more recently  the demand for a new international economic order  pitting as it were  North against South. All have fostered a spirit of intransigence and intolerance which hindered the common search for generally acceptable solutions to world problems.161.	There was  perhaps  a certain shortness of vision in mustering the so-called automatic majorities  as well as in the disdainful dismissal by the great Powers of the decisions made by those majorities. There was a marked attitude which implied that what the leaders and spokesmen of Asia  Africa and Latin America demanded was of little account  since the fate of the world would hinge  in the last analysis  on the security of the Western democracies and those cultural values that they had nurtured through many centuries.162.	It is fair to point out that there has now been a hopeful change in that attitude. It has not yet become general  but one may hope that it will spread. There is no doubt that there are those who will look askance at the moral basis of the foreign policy proclaimed by the new administration in the United States of America. I  for one  welcome it because it reinforces my advocacy two years ago  in this very chamber  of an international code of ethics which might restrain ambition and greed.163.	Of more immediate importance  however  is the unprecedented interest  understanding and sympathy which now apparently pervade American foreign policy under the leadership of President Carter with regard to the developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. It is not unwarranted to sense in this policy a lively desire to devote closer attention to the problems of the developing countries.164.	We need no longer emphasize that developing countries do matter  that the Asian  African and Latin American nations and peoples can neither be ignored nor dismissed as of no account  or their problems swept under the carpet.165.	The willingness to be involved on the part of the Western democracies was apparent in their meaningful high-level participation in the recent United Nations meetings on apartheid and racial discrimination  and even more positively  in the initiatives taken to achieve independence for Namibia and propose a settlement in Zimbabwe-which should fully and fairly satisfy the demands of the majority for emancipation and equality.166.	This multilateral effort of consultation and negotiation with all the existing forces inside and outside the country  and with concerned countries on its borders  on as near a basis of equality as possible  is a real and historic break from the past. We no longer have here an imperial condescension imposing the quick miracle of a unilateral decision. We find instead a sincere search for partnership in the common quest for peace and equality—indeed  for peace through equality.167.	The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have consistently shown their support for the elimination of all forms of discrimination  oppression and exploitation. For its part  the People's Republic of China has always identified itself as one of the developing countries. By the same token  1 trust the developing countries will welcome such a change of attitude in the Western democracies  and its consequent reinforcement of a movement in which they have played an active part. This development is surely a contribution to world peace.168.	Unfortunately there is another aspect to this interest in the developing countries  and that is why I say these are confusing and contradictory times.169.	To begin with  we know how nations of the developing world are severely hampered in improving their conditions and in attaining even a modicum of development by existing arrangements in the international economy. It is not even possible to forecast the most modest improvement of the situation unless fundamental adjustments are made in the international economic order. These urgently and desperately needed adjustments will never be achieved if the industrialized countries maintain rigidly defensive positions. The results of the Paris meetings were disappointing  even depressing  for the developing countries.170.	Similarly  a successful conclusion of the current negotiations on the law of the sea is of vital importance as we move towards the civilization of the future  which will be based on the cultures shaped by the oceans and the seas. For  as global land resources diminish in relation to expanding population  mankind must turn to the seas for life. Ultimately  the survival of mankind will depend on a rational and peaceful use of the sea  and the sea-bed and its resources. But the Conference on the Law of the Sea has yet to agree on rules that would ensure that the vast oceans and seas of the world do not breed conflict and strife but instead serve to link and unify nations and peoples.171.	Yet the inescapable truth is that we  the developing countries  must work out our own salvation. What the industrialized countries do or fail to do may help or hinder  but in the end the solution to our problems lies mainly in our hands.172.	The Philippine experience during this decade is  I believe  a demonstration of one people's determination to be self-reliant  to develop as it will  to make friends as it sees fit and to participate in such endeavours of national reconstruction as will specifically promote national and global interests.173.	As a developing country-in population seventeenth in the world  with a population of 44 million inhabitants- the Philippines has striven and is still striving to give our people  under the leadership of President Marcos  a social structure and a politico-economic system that will guarantee them the basic human rights: the right to life  to self-fulfilment  to self-determination and to equality  and to emancipation from the feudal and oligarchic oppressions of the past.174.	The civil administration and constitutional Government of President Marcos can proudly stand on its record of political stability  economic development  law enforcement  social progress and respect for human rights.175. In our international relations we have assiduously fostered relations of friendship and co-operation with our neighbours in the Association of South East Asian Nations. In an unprecedented gesture of regional solidarity  in the face even of some domestic criticism  our Government has openly taken steps to withdraw its claim over Sabah.176.	In various parts of the world today other regional communities express the desire of neighbouring or kindred nations to co-operate for peace and progress. These communities  particularly those specifically concerned with economic and social goals  are important touchstones in the development of a world society.177.	Negotiations at the level of regional associations must help to promote conciliation between North and South and thus create momentum for authentic internationalism.178.	What goes on at the regional geographic level occurs also in many sectors of international activity. Specialized agencies of the United Nations are performing essential tasks quickly but effectively. Specific concerns such as the environment  the children of the world  desertification and food and famine have brought nations together in common programmes of action  even though their national interests do not always coincide in other areas of endeavour.179.	Significantly  these meetings and conferences have gathered in many widely scattered places—in Stockholm  Nairobi  Bucharest  Belgrade  Helsinki  Caracas and Mexico City. In Manila  we were happy to play host to the joint meeting of IMF and the World Bank  the 1977 sessions of the World Food Council and the UNICEF Executive Beard and  before that  to the Group of 77. Does this not suggest that perhaps peoples and Governments will find it easier to attain mutual understanding and agreement when their representatives acquire familiarity with the way in which other people live  with the conditions in which other Governments function?180.	The issue of human rights  for instance  has recently been endowed with special importance. Yet this issue is incredibly complicated by the infinite varieties of time  geography  history  culture and other circumstances and by differing hierarchies of values among nations. It is only through actual knowledge and experience of these factors that an enlightened understanding can be reached.181.	Surely that is why the rules of procedure of the General Assembly provide that the General Assembly can be convened anywhere in the world. So far  it has met only in Europe and in the United States. Would it not be possible-would it not be helpful  even-if it met on occasion somewhere in the third world?182.	If memory does not betray us  the Security Council met in Panama City some time ago  and it is net mere conjecture that this meeting within sight of the physical issue in controversy may have eventually led to the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the Canal.183.	Who knows what subtle influence might be exercised on our deliberations if the General Assembly were to consider the question of nuclear proliferation in Hiroshima? Or the Palestinian problem in Gaza? Or the problem of famine and food resources in the Sahel? Or the issue of apartheid in Soweto?184.	My country does not have such tragic memories or such agonizing issues. But it is a country of the third world  which is a microcosm  an archetype  of its problems-the fair and efficient distribution of land and other resources among an expanding population  the choice between immediate industrialization and the assurance of an adequate food supply  the inadequate employment and consequent disillusionment and discontent of its youth  the balance between authority and indiscipline  individual rights and racial obligations.185.	It is a country where the General Assembly may see for itself what is meant by the third world. Perhaps we may get the feel of its problems at first hand while enjoying the most modern facilities and comforts which the work of the General Assembly and its Secretariat requires for maximum efficiency.186.	And so I shall conclude with a modest but none the less sincere and earnest proposal to invite the General Assembly through you. Mr. President  to hold its thirty- third session in Manila  of which I am privileged to be the humble Governor. You shall be most welcome—and more than welcome — I assure you.187.	For us it will be a matter of national pride. But it will be more than that. It will be  I trust  an opportunity for the General Assembly to move  for once  and perhaps many times again  from the towers and palaces of the great Powers to the frontiers of that other world  the third world  which  after all  most of us represent and with whose problems we are most exercised.188.	For  ultimately  we are concerned with knowing one another  understanding one mother's problems and becoming involved in their solution. We can do so most successfully in one another's homes. "
"103",5621,"PNG",32,1977,"﻿ Two years ago  on the occasion of Papua New Guinea's admission to membership in the United Nations  I had the honour to address the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.1 Since then Papua New Guinea has held national elections  and I now avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm Papua New Guinea's support of and continuing commitment to the principles of the United Nations.1.	Papua New Guinea wishes to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to your high office. The task that you have been given is not an easy one  as the outcome of this session of the General Assembly will depend largely on your guidance. I wish you well in this task.2.	I wish also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  who performed his duties as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly with distinction.3.	I should also like to place on record Papua New Guinea's appreciation for the work done by the Secretary- General and his staff.4.	It gives me great pleasure  on behalf of the people of Papua New Guinea  to extend a warm welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti as new Members of the United Nations. 5.	Papua New Guinea is still a very young Member of the United Nations family and is only now becoming aware of the full scope of the Organization. Our experience with the United Nations has  so far  been .limited to a number of the special bodies of the Organization and its related agencies. These are already making a valuable contribution to Papua New Guinea's development.6.	There are numerous United Nations conferences and meetings held every year on many and varied technical matters. In view of our limited resources  we have carefully selected the conferences to which we could send representatives  but now we must ask whether the diversity and complexity of the matters considered by the United Nations family have not grown so great that this Organization is losing its effectiveness. Papua New Guinea hopes that a cautious review of this problem could be made.7.	Papua New Guinea attended the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London in June and came away from it with a sense of achievement. The Commonwealth has proved that it can play an effective role in the field of international affairs  and we therefore applaud the decision taken at the last General Assembly session to grant the Commonwealth Secretariat observer status within the United Nations 8.	Papua New Guinea has been involved  through direct participation  in programmes of action and development undertaken by the world community to create a peaceful and balanced world order  especially in the field of international trade. We have also followed with much interest the current North-South dialogue at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. We deeply regret that the results of that Conference fell short of expectations. Papua New Guinea will continue its active participation in the meetings under the auspices of UNCTAD  particularly in relation to the Integrated Programme for Commodities with the common fund. We should like to see a much firmer commitment by the parties involved on these two particular issues. This commitment should be one based on an honest and realistic exploration of all avenues  because failing to do so may well lead to inappropriate and inadequate solutions  and certainly not to the new international economic order we all wish to see.9.	My Government has noted with concern the failure so far of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to reach a successful conclusion. Papua New Guinea is among those countries which have felt obliged to take action to extend fishing limits to protect their resources. We acknowledge  however  that this kind of individual self-help is a poor substitute for a generally-accepted treaty. The Conference also failed to meet the just demands of the third world for a fair and equitable regime to govern the exploitation of the deep-sea-bed.10.	In the absence of a new treaty  the general extension of fishing limits has created a special challenge for the countries of the South Pacific. Most of Us in the South Pacific are developing countries; some lack any resources of economic value except fish. Fisheries management has presented these countries with a new opportunity for regional co-operation. However  we know that this is a field in which rich and powerful countries can gain benefits at the expense of the smaller  less-developed nations. Papua New Guinea is a small country  but we are determined to resist exploitation by foreign fishing interests. We are also determined to see that the policy of regional co-operation takes account of the interests of our developing neighbours  including those not yet fully independent and those smaller than ourselves.11.	Papua New Guinea was honoured to welcome Samoa  another member of the Pacific group  into the United Nations at the last session. We hope that with the admission of more Pacific countries into the United Nations and other agencies the voice of the South Pacific can now be clearly heard.12.	The South Pacific region is often thought to consist of many small island-nations without regional identity. That is no longer true: the region now has an identity in the South Pacific Forum  and we hope that decisions made by that body will be given due consideration by the United Nations  its related agencies and all Member nations. .13.	Papua New Guinea is an ardent supporter of the decolonization process  and we note with considerable gratification that our near neighbour  the Solomon Islands  will become independent next year. It is the hope of Papua New Guinea that all of the few remaining colonies  not only within the South Pacific area but world-wide  will achieve self-determination within the immediate future.14.	I should now like to speak about some of the major international issues before the General Assembly. Of particular concern to Papua New Guinea are developments in southern Africa.15.	First  as regards Rhodesia  Papua New Guinea strongly supports a negotiated settlement between the parties involved. We welcome efforts by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to seek a constitutional settlement there. We would not support the use of force in any settlement of this question. We have already made it clear at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting that we should like to see majority rule in Rhodesia. Any settlement there must fully ensure the rights of the black African majority.16.	Papua New Guinea condemns the situation in southern Africa  where the rights of the people are totally suppressed by small white minorities. Full pressure should be brought to bear on these minority regimes to ensure an equitable settlement in southern Africa. Papua New Guinea fully supports the present sanctions imposed upon South Africa and Rhodesia. However  we have serious reservations about their effectiveness  particularly when influential Members of this Organization do not play their part by enforcing them.17.	My country recently banned trade with South Africa. Although trade between Papua New Guinea and South Africa was very small  we wish to play our part in enforcing the sanctions. We call upon other  more influential Members of the United Nations to be totally honest in enforcing the agreed sanctions. We feel that the racist regime will continue to oppress the majority of the people of South Africa as long as Members of this Organization continue illegally to trade or associate with this racist regime.18.	While we are concerned at illegal white minority regimes that cause suffering to black people in southern Africa  Papua New Guinea is also gravely concerned that in Uganda there is a black regime which resorts to oppression of its own people. This must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by this Assembly  and we urge that consideration should be given to ways in which this Assembly can help to alleviate suffering in that country.19.	In addition to the appalling denial of human rights already mentioned  there are instances of many other countries denying their citizens basic human rights. Such violations must be strongly condemned. It is the view of my Government that this Organization must take appropriate action to ensure that all people of all races are accorded the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter and other instruments of the United Nations.20.	Another area of grave concern to us is the continuing development and testing of new types of nuclear weapons. In the past we have strongly opposed the testing of such weapons  particularly in the Pacific region  and we will continue to do so. That the testing of nuclear weapons has not been totally banned is a matter to be regretted  and 1 urge all nations to co-operate in the search for an effective means of controlling those weapons of mass destruction.21.	There is one further issue that I must mention. That is the question of resolving the conflict situation in the Middle East. We commend the diplomatic initiatives taken by the United States of America on this problem and have sincere hopes of their success. It is essential that there be an early resumption of the Geneva negotiations. We hold the view that a Palestinian State must be given recognition but  on the other hand  we firmly believe that Israel must not be denied the right to exist as a sovereign State.22.	I have touched on a number of issues of real concern to the world community and hope that this session will find lasting solutions to those and many other issues to be debated in this forum. Finally  I wish to reiterate the view of my Government that our involvement and participation in international affairs reflects the genuine values that our people have and their aspirations to live in a peaceful world. We shall continue to be mindful of developments on the international scene and the likely implications for PapuaNew Guinea and the region of which we are part. Papua New Guinea will continue to contribute  within its limited resources  to the objectives of this Organization and to accept our share of the responsibilities of membership in the United Nations and the international community. "
"104",5667,"POL",32,1977,"﻿38.	 Permit me  Sir  to congratulate you warmly upon your election to the important post of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We welcome in you a distinguished diplomat from socialist Yugoslavia  a country to which we are bound by the closest of relations. I am convinced that under your presidency this session of the Assembly will make an important contribution to the process of positive transformations which are at present going on in the world. The Polish delegation will spare no effort to see to it that this session of the General Assembly is constructive and fruitful.39.	We should like to express our gratitude to the President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  for his active participation and his remarkable contribution to the work of the session that has just ended.40.	From this rostrum  we should like once again to welcome warmly as a Member of this Organization the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose heroic people is pursuing a policy of peace  socialism  and friendship among nations. It is with particular satisfaction that we see it taking its rightful place in the United Nations. We wish the Vietnamese people all possible success. We are convinced that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will make an important contribution to the work of the Organization  and thus enrich the activities and progressive movements within the Organization as well as its role in the world arena.41.	We should also like to bid welcome to the Republic of Djibouti. We hope that its efforts are successful  both in its socio-economic development and in its work in the United Nations.42.	The thirty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very complex time in the evolution of the international situation. The struggle for the maintenance and strengthening of the process of detente in the world has entered a particularly important stage  where all Governments share responsibility both for its future orientation and for its results. It seems to us that there exist at present not only the objective conditions but also forms and methods that have proved themselves such as to make of this process a firmly established element in international practice. In spite of difficulties and setbacks  the restructuring of international relations  both political and economic  is continuing to go forward in accordance with the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems and at different levels of socio-economic development. Important bilateral  regional  and even world negotiations are taking place designed to consolidate International security  to put an end to the arms race  to bring about progress in disarmament and to develop co-operation on an equal footing among all countries in every field.  43.	The efforts of peace-loving States and numerous social forces have had a favourable impact on the strengthening of detente. At the head of the movement we find the socialist States  which have chosen as the fundamental objective of their foreign policy action to strengthen peace and to reject the use of war and of force as an instrument of policy.44.	The efforts to that end which the Soviet Union  Poland and the other socialist States have ceaselessly made in total conformity with the principles of the Charter do not depend on tactics or political opportunism. They derive from the fundamental axioms of our ideology and political system  the aspirations and needs of our people and of all peoples. Their deep-lying roots are to be found in the objectives proclaimed by the Great Socialist October Revolution. The present session of the General Assembly coincides with the culmination of the celebrations held to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution. The influence of the October Revolution on the destiny of the world is as vast as it is diverse. In both the theoretical and the practical field  it gave birth to the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems  a principle which experience has shown to be entirely justified and far-sighted  a principle which began the historic transformation of international relations and which continues to exert a powerful influence on the strengthening of the process of detente.45.	The Polish people is firmly convinced that the strengthening of detente and the extension of that process to new areas and new fields of activity have now become an imperative necessity for all States  whatever their political systems  whether they be great or small  developed or developing. Because detente is not just one more option among others; it is the only possible option.46.	That is precisely the guiding principle underlying the foreign policy of Poland. The ties of unbreakable friendship and co-operation in all fields with our socialist allies constitute the foundation upon which rests the realization of the political and economic objectives of Poland. We are constantly strengthening our fraternal links and promoting close co-operation with the Soviet Union. Similarly  we are strengthening our co-operation with Czechoslovakia and with the German Democratic Republic  as well as with all States that make up our socialist community. We are broadening our political dialogue and co-operation  on the basis of mutual advantage  with States having different social and political systems. We are attempting to establish closer links of co-operation with the non-aligned States and with the developing countries.47.	We are pleased to note that during the past year bilateral and multilateral agreements  in particular those among States which took part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  have been multiplied.48.	The implementation of the principles and provisions laid down in the Final Act of that Conference is a continuing process. These principles and provisions  which find expression in the practical policies of States  have been reflected in a great number of declarations and agreements concluded between Poland and its partners. There have also been a great number of meetings held between Polish leaders and the leaders of European States and of countries in other continents. The practice of systematic political consultation is a fast growing one. Relations between Poland and France are close and continue to develop fruitfully. Poland has established broad co-operation with the Nordic States  the United Kingdom  Belgium  Italy and Austria. In the spirit of the Final Act of Helsinki and on the basis of the relevant bilateral agreements  we are developing our relations with the United States. The process of the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany is progressing  as is co-operation between our two countries.49.	This is an important contribution to the establishment in the world of lasting conditions for peace and detente  without which there can be no solution of regional and world problems.50.	This year is also marked by the Belgrade meeting of the representatives of States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Poland  like its socialist allies and friends  considers that  over all  the provisions of the Final Act have been implemented positively. We consider die Final Act as an integral part of a long-term process. We reaffirm our determination to put into practice all the principles and provisions of that important document. We therefore expect our partners to do likewise.51.	The organs of the United Nations system—such as the Economic Commission for Europe and UNESCO—can and must play an important role in the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act.52.	The United Nations has a leading role to play in the strengthening of the process of detente and international peace and security. The importance of the United Nations is today more than ever directly dependent upon the extent to which our Organization can help to find ways of reaching those objectives and succeeds in transposing positive regional experience to the world level and in creating conditions which will  in accordance with the Charter  make it possible to achieve settlements of conflicts and a relaxation of tension. And that is something which will be even truer in the future. The United Nations can and must  therefore  more than ever constitute  a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends .53.	Possibilities for strengthening the positive trends in the world do objectively exist. However  this session will live up to the hopes placed in it only if it can contribute to the international efforts at strengthening the process of detente. There can be no doubt that this whole process is particularly influenced by the Soviet-American dialogue  to the pursuit and success of which we attach the greatest importance. The limitation of strategic weapons and the halting of the arms race are of supreme importance. Together with the overwhelming majority of States in the world  we hope for progress in this field  which is of paramount importance.54.	More and more people today are becoming convinced that sources of tension and conflict can and must be eliminated by peaceful means. The United Nations Charter provides a wide range of measures to achieve that end. Their strengthening cannot but be furthered by the important initiative of the USSR with regard to the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. If such a treaty were to emerge  it would facilitate the solution of situations of conflict  both present and future  in accordance with the United Nations Charter; it would constitute a valuable instrument for modelling international relations on a world-wide scale.55.	In contrast to those positive actions and results  it is with much concern that We detect in the policies of certain States signs pointing in the opposite direction from the trend towards world detente and that we witness attempts at resolving world problems by a stepping up of tension and the recourse to force.56.	The lack of progress towards a solution of the Middle East conflict is a source of deep concern to us. We wish to stress again that the only effective way of solving that problem is to return to the Arab States all territories occupied by Israel since 1967  within the framework of an over-all political settlement that would take into account the rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including their right to self-determination and the creation of an independent State. Such a settlement should also take account of the vital rights and interests with regard to the security of all States and all peoples of the region  including Israel. We shall continue to spare no effort to see to it that our participation in the United Nations Forces in the Middle East serves the attainment of these objectives  in accordance with United Nations resolutions.57.	We declare our support for the prompt resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.58.	Polish public opinion has been very much alarmed by the recent illegal decisions of Israel to perpetuate its occupation of Arab territories by the establishment there of Israeli settlements.59.	The past year has seen a great many events that have drawn the attention of the world community to the urgent problems of the African continent  to the national liberation struggle  to the elimination of racism and apartheid  and to respect for the right of peoples to choose their own path of development. The international forces of reaction and neo-colonialism have refused to loosen their grip  and are still attempting to oppose the historic process of the liberation of nations from colonial and racist oppression.60.	The just struggle of the peoples of southern Africa enjoys the sympathy and support of the whole of progressive mankind  and thus of the Polish people. We resolutely demand that the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe be allowed  unconditionally and without delay  to exercise their right to self-determination and independence.61.	We support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts to achieve the peaceful and democratic reunification of its country and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula.62.	The Polish people continues  indignantly to protest against  the persistence of mass persecutions and human rights violations in Chile.63.	The implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions would greatly contribute  on the legal and political plane  to a relaxation of tensions in the Cyprus conflict and to ensuring respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.64.	Disarmament and a halting of the arms race are of paramount importance if we want to ensure further progress in the policy of detente and to make that process irreversible. The preservation of peace and the dynamics of detente will depend upon the progress actually achieved in that field. In his report on the meeting of the Political Advisory Committee of States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  held in Bucharest  Comrade Edward Gierek  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party stated: In the present phase of the situation in Europe and in the rest of the world  it is imperative to strengthen political detente by military detente  by the halting of the arms race  which is continuing and has even been stepped up recently  and by the creation of new prospects for disarmament. 65.	The Polish delegation is convinced that all the questions relating to disarmament on the agenda of the thirty-second session occupy a central position of priority in the work of our Assembly. We agree with the Secretary- General when he states in his report on the work of the Organization that: ... the United Nations cannot hope to function effectively on the basis of the Charter unless there is major progress in the field of disarmament. If only for these reasons  we wish to reaffirm our support for the Soviet memorandum of 28 September 1976s and to stress the timeliness of that document  which contains a vast programme of measures designed to give further momentum to and inject increased vigour into disarmament negotiations.66.	In the same spirit we subscribe to the proposals presented the day before yesterday by Minister Andrei Gromyko with regard to the deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of a nuclear war.67.	We are firmly convinced that it is the responsibility and duty of every State and every Government to work for disarmament. For this purpose we have available organs which have proved their value  in particular the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. Poland participates actively in the work of that body  as it does in the Vienna discussions on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe. Indeed  we consider regional negotiations on disarmament to be an important complement to the talks held at the world level with the universal objective of general disarmament.68.	Of the long list of questions relating to disarmament I should like to stress those which we consider to be the most important and urgent.69.	It is urgent and necessary to strengthen the regime established by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is indispensable to intensify efforts to make the Treaty universal and to prevail upon all States to act in accordance with its provisions. We expressed this conviction in the Polish- French Declaration published only two weeks ago.70.	We call for the preparation of effective international instruments  of regional or universal scope  which would guarantee that fissile material  installations and nuclear techniques exported for peaceful purposes would not be diverted to the production of nuclear weapons. We condemn the ambitions of South Africa to obtain this type of weapon. We are also opposed to the use of foreign installations and territories for the development and perfecting of armaments.71.	We should like to stress also the need for the urgent continuation of negotiations on a general and complete ban on nuclear weapon tests and the prohibition of the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.72.	We sincerely hope that it will soon prove possible to draft an appropriate agreement on the elimination of chemical weapons. Throughout the present session Poland will continue to play an active part in the consideration of this important question.73.	As a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament we are trying to ensure that the work of this Committee will be an important stage in the work for disarmament and will at the same time lead to the convening of a world conference on disarmament.74.	It is the historic responsibility and the duty of all Governments and all of us  their representatives at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly  to ensure a better standard of living for the present generation and for generations to come. It is precisely by strengthening international security and consolidating the process of detente that we establish the political foundations for the general progress of all nations and the installation of a new world economic order based on justice.75.	It is above all thanks to progressive socio-political reforms  to the mobilization of domestic resources  to the acceleration of the process of industrialization and the introduction of planned methods of development that we shall succeed in satisfying the needs of man fully and permanently. The dynamic expansion of the forces of production makes external factors increasingly important  particularly the expansion of a mutually advantageous and equitable economic co-operation which would  in particular  give access at one and the same time to outlets  to supply markets and to sources of finance and modern technology.76.	The organs of the United Nations are the only universal institutions within which the international community can and must find a solution to world problems  the problems which the nations face in their search for more rapid growth and a restructuring of economic relations at regional and world levels. The results of what is known as the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation have shown that these problems cannot be solved within a limited group of States.77.	The principles and the machinery of international economic co-operation which are' being developed should take account of the interests of all States as well as the differences deriving from their level of economic development and their socio-political system.78.	In the context of the socio-economic development strategy which it has chosen Poland is participating increasingly in the international division of labour. We take an interest and play an active part in the development of new principles and machinery designed to govern international economic relations. We support all well-founded proposals aimed at putting these relations on firm and long-term foundations and also on principles of the mutual advantage and equality of the partners. The studies of long-term trends and estimates with regard to economic development at world and regional levels recently undertaken on the initiative of Poland can undoubtedly contribute to the performance of this task. Over-all socio-economic estimates of the growth of the world economy up to the year 2000 could be useful for the development of the new international development strategy.79.	In the long-term interest of all States it would be desirable for them to orient their external economic policy in such a way as to ensure the elimination of the remaining obstacles  particularly those which are protectionist and discriminatory in nature. The States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  of which my country is one  are pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening socialist integration in all fields and intensifying co-operation with all other nations. The development of bilateral economic contacts between Poland and countries with different socio-political systems and at different levels of economic growth strengthens this objective trend. Close co-operation  transcending the traditional patterns of trade  link us with many countries in all continents. I am convinced that this type of association which creates new structural ties between the participating States promotes the establishment of a new and more just economic order and lends specific substance to detente.80.	Prompted by this spirit of broad economic co-operation  Poland and the other States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance hold that any restriction on such co-operation is a glaring anachronism in the world today. That is why they have proposed to the States members of the European Economic Community the negotiation of a draft outline agreement based on the most-favoured-nation clause which would constitute the basis for co-operation conceived in the broadest possible terms between the States members of the two economic groupings. We hope that the initiative of the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will be welcomed with realism by the members of the European Economic Community and that such an agreement can be concluded.81.	My country attaches great importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The success of the Conference will depend  of course  upon the acceptance of compromise solutions which take due account of the interests of all States and groups of States in such fundamental matters as fishing  the status of the economic zone  the exploitation of the sea-bed  and so on. Recent attempts by certain coastal States to impose solutions to their advantage alone are hardly conducive to success in the work of the Conference and are in fact liable to lead to dangerous tensions which could be the cause of future conflicts.82.	There can be no development or world progress until the most pressing social problems are solved and until conditions exist to permit the peoples of the world effectively to enjoy material goods and the advantages of progress and culture. That is why we give the highest priority in our Organization to the application of the principles laid down in the 1969 Declaration on Social Progress and Development  and also to action against racism  for the equitable distribution of national income  for the training of skilled personnel with a view to development and for the elimination of discrimination against women.83.	Involved as it is in the struggle for peace and detente  Poland has often stressed from this rostrum the importance of international efforts to educate youth in a spirit of peace and mutual co-operation. This important element in the work of our Organization means without any doubt that we should be paying much more attention to it. Poland for its part would like to encourage all projects undertaken to this end. The many world youth meetings held in Poland  as well as the participation of Polish youth of other international gatherings  are best proof of this. We believe that international co-operation with a view to reviewing  bringing up to date and supplementing school textbooks  should play an important role in educating youth in a spirit of peace.84.	More than 40 States have ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights. These Covenants constitute an important body of principles aimed at guiding States in their observance of human rights. They are a basis for international co-operation in this field. Poland and the other socialist countries are among those which have ratified the Covenants. We consider this fact to be major importance since the very essence of socialism is to ensure democratic rights and opportunities for human progress. It is precisely the socialist States which  in the United Nations and its agencies  have always worked hard to promote the progressive development of the concept of human rights. To quote Edward Gierek  First Secretary of the Central Committee of our Party: It is we  it is our movement  it is our countries  it is socialism itself which has brought this idea to the attention of the world and has made it over the years a question of historic importance. 85.	The socialist countries are also those endeavouring to ensure for man conditions propitious to the effective exercise of these rights. They are proud of all they have done from the standpoint of general socio-economic growth  the development of socialist democracy and the constitutional and material safeguards accorded to the rights and freedoms of the citizen.86.	In performing the above tasks confronting our Organization  we shall have to demonstrate goodwill  and a readiness to negotiate and respect each other's interests.87.	On the basis of the experience acquired over the more than 30 years of the existence of our Organization  we are convinced that the United Nations can and must make an important contribution to the strengthening of peace  to the development of international co-operation and to the acceleration of socio-economic progress. Permit us to stress  at the same time  that it is only by unswerving attachment to the unshakeable principles of the United Nations Charter that we can reach these objectives.88.	The achievements of the United Nations derive from the actions of all its Members. A share in this belongs to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We have followed with interest his efforts in the service of peace. We expressed this sentiment fully during the Secretary- General's recent visit to Poland.89.	In conclusion  I should like to assure you  Mr. President  that Poland will give its whole-hearted support to the efforts of our Organization in keeping with the purposes and principles of its Charter and will continue to work actively within the context of the guidelines they provide.

"105",5738,"PRT",32,1977,"﻿179.	 It is with great pleasure that I extend to Mr. Lazar Mojsov  the representative of Yugoslavia  my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I do this with all the more pleasure since he represents a friendly nation with which Portugal in recent years has established relations of mutual respect and benefit  quickly reaching a level of close friendship and co-operation  to which the official visit to Portugal next month of Marshal Tito  at the invitation of the President of the Portuguese Republic  Ramalho Eanes  will bear witness.180.	1 should like to direct a few words of sincere appreciation and thanks to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  the representative of Sri Lanka  another friendly nation  to which Portugal has for several centuries been linked historically and culturally  for the manner in which he presided over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly and guided its work with such efficiency and distinction.181.	I am especially pleased to greet the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to whose enlightened vision of international life  sense of history and justice  and high human and diplomatic qualities the United Nations and the very community of nations owe so much.182.	I am also pleased at this time to salute the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  expressing the hope that a close co-operation will soon be established within the United Nations between the delegations of Portugal and of these new Member States  whose admission represents yet another step not only towards the conclusion of the decolonization process undertaken by the United Nations but also towards the universality of the Organization  which is so much to be desired.183.	Last year  my country voted in favour of General Assembly resolution 31/21  which then recommended the admission of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations. This year we had the honour of sponsoring the draft resolution that approved the admission of Viet Nam to the United Nations.184.	With the admission to the United Nations  still during the last session of the General Assembly  of the People's Republic of Angola-which we had strongly supported and greeted with deep joy—all the nations emerging from the policy of decolonization initiated by Portugal on 25 April 1974 are now fully represented in the United Nations. These nations bear witness to the determination with which Portugal has sought to be in step with history and to meet  not only the thinking of the United Nations  but  above all  the legitimate and natural aspirations of the peoples whom we had colonized for centuries.185.	I greet all the representatives of the community of nations here present  but I direct a very special salute to the representatives of Angola  Cape Verde  Guinea Bissau  Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe-countries with which Portugal and Brazil today form a vast human community linked by blood  history  tradition  culture and  finally  a common language in which I am addressing the Assembly today  a language that  as I stated here last year  we believe is bound to play an increasingly important role in the task of bringing men together and helping them to free themselves from alienation.186.	We trust that in the future that role will be acknowledged by the United Nations itself through the recognition of Portuguese as one of the official languages of the Organization.187.	It may be pointed out in this connexion that the Portuguese language has  in fact  already been used as a working language in international meetings that have taken place under the aegis of the United Nations  as in the recent International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia held at Maputo.188.	We believe  therefore  that the Portuguese language can be instrumental in helping men overcome their difficulties in every field-ideological  technological  political and social.189.	Last year  I had an opportunity in this Assembly to outline the major principles which guide democratic Portugal in international relations and which are enshrined in our Constitution.190.	Since then  during the first year of the Constitutional Government  the Republic of Portugal has acted in accordance with those principles.191.	One of the efforts of our diplomacy that 1 should like to point out in particular is Portugal's pending request for admission into the European Economic Community made in March of this year  and we are expecting a reply.192.	The spirit that prevailed in the talks which Prime Minister Mario Soares had in the capitals of the nine countries members of the Community  and which I was privileged to follow enables us to envisage this accession with confidence.193.	Our commitment towards a democratic  strong and united Europe is now total. This democratic Europe should not  however  be conceived as an end in itself  but rather as a factor of stability and world peace as well as a natural ally of the developing countries. A democratic Europe is  for Portugal  a basis for a world-wide policy of understanding and co-operation.194.	To achieve this all European nations  even those with different political regimes  must maintain the continent in a climate of detente. We thus attach great value to the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe now proceeding in Belgrade. The mere fact that the Conference is taking place is  for us  a most encouraging sign.195.	We shall go to Belgrade in a constructive spirit  ready to recognize the positive results achieved following the Final Act of Helsinki  but also seeking to strengthen its implementation.196.	It is our belief that detente in Europe will encourage the possibility of achieving an international order that will be more stable and less affected by the spectre of violent conflict. If such an understanding is possible in Europe  then certainly it can be in other regions.197.	In this light  Portugal considers the presence in Belgrade of the countries of the Mediterranean area to be a means of associating the greatest possible number of nations with it and with the effort towards such an understanding.198.	The world continues to be clouded by very serious problems calling for the increased attention of the community of nations. The General Assembly will examine them all  and we hope  for our part  to make a positive contribution  if not towards their respective solutions  at least towards their clarification and better assessment.199.	I shall refer to two of them in particular  because of their seriousness and because they are certainly those which the Portuguese Government regards with the greatest attention in view of their specific nature  the interests and values at stake  and the multiple affinities that link us to the peoples concerned.200.	As a nation both European and Atlantic  we are bound to Africa  and not only to Portuguese-speaking Africa  by multiple ties that are centuries old. We cannot be indifferent to anything that occurs in Africa not only because of its effects on international order  but also because of the real esteem in which we hold the peoples of Africa and the respect we have for their struggle to put an immediate end to all those situations that bear the intolerable stamp of colonialism or represent an unacceptable denial of the most basic human rights.201.	Portugal cannot fail to add its efforts to those of all nations and ail political forces in the world which condemn the stubborn persistence in southern Africa of political concepts  institutions or forms of government that  whatever may be the arguments invoked in their defence  seem designed merely to ensure the survival of an unjust political and social order and to postpone satisfaction of the legitimate desire of the peoples of southern Africa to be masters of their own destiny.202.	For these reasons  the Portuguese Government hopes that the independence of Namibia  with full respect for its unity and territorial integrity  will not be delayed. We trust that the diplomatic efforts being made to bring together the different parties involved in this matter will meet with success so as to end  through negotiation  the illegal occupation of Namibia.203.	In this respect  I should like to recall Security Council resolution 385(1976)  which constitutes a framework for an acceptable solution of this problem. If this is not achieved  it will not be possible to avoid an escalation of the armed conflict that has been taking place for years to achieve the liberation of that Territory  a conflict caused by the intransigence and stubbornness of the occupying Power.204.	By the same token  the Government of Portugal expresses its hope that the rebel regime of Rhodesia will shortly come to an end. The aggravation of the situation in that Territory has serious implications for the peace and security of all the countries in the area  and causes justifiable apprehension within the international community. Evidence of this can be seen in the attacks against Mozambique and incursions into its territory which have been condemned by the Security Council.205.	We hope that a solution can soon be found to put an end to the tragedy now taking place there  thus enabling the establishment in Zimbabwe of a true majority Government. There is no other way to avoid further sacrifices in human lives and the further heightening of racial tensions and hatred. Besides  the continued deterioration of the conflict may render the intervention of outside forces unavoidable.206.	In this respect I feel that the United Nations should lend its utmost attention to the recent proposals made by the United Kingdom aimed at restoring legality in Rhodesia and at solving the Rhodesian question  proposals which were fully supported by the Government of the United States.207.	At the same time we expressly condemn the doctrine as well as the practice of apartheid. We take this position all the more firmly since  whatever the errors Portugal was accused of during its colonial period—errors which the Portuguese democrats never failed to condemn-all forms of racial discrimination have always been abhorrent to us. The end of racism should in no way signify the separation of races by continents  but should instead mean their coexistence and interpenetration in the areas where history has brought them together. In this spirit  Portugal recently attended in Lagos the World Conference for Action against Apartheid.208.	Another area of the world-the Middle East-has become in the past 30 years the scene of a tragedy that  despite all efforts to end it and notwithstanding the repeated affirmations of the countries involved that they wish to arrive at a peaceful solution  has already resulted in many thousands of victims  has been and probably will continue to be a grave threat to the peace of the world  and constitutes a flagrant example of how fear  false notions of security  and a sectarian spirit can mislead those who govern.209.	Portugal does not have direct interests in that region. However  the vicissitudes of history have bound us by culture arid blood to the peoples who have taken part and have been victims in this drama.210.	It seems intolerable to the people and Government of Portugal that millions of human beings continue to live in the Middle East under the threat and sometimes under the harsh laws of war in spite of all the efforts made to find a peace formula that should ensure the right to exist to every State in the region  without exception  and the right of the Palestinian people to create its own homeland.211.	A formula will have to be found which  while guaranteeing to Israel the respect of its borders and of its very right to exist  will definitely prevent it from continuing  under whatever pretext  to occupy territories which it does not own and which were conquered by force 10 years ago  and from trying to extend its influence on them through the illegal establishment of settlements  the purpose of which is merely to consolidate  if not to perpetuate  a status quo clearly and justly condemned by the international conscience. Portugal associates itself with this condemnation  and has not done so earlier for the sole reason that it considers this rostrum of the United Nations to be the most adequate place to do it.212.	I repeat  a formula will have to be found depriving Israel of the authority it claims to have to deny the Palestinian people the right-which  after all  it claims for itself—to be the master of its national destiny  a formula that would enable the Palestinian people to see its right to create its own homeland unanimously recognized by the international community.213.	Portugal supports the rapid convening of the Geneva Conference with the participation of the representatives of the Palestinian people in such a way as to recognize its aspirations and to give Israel security assurances.214.	In the Far East my country still maintains formal responsibilities with respect to the Territory of East Timor. As we have repeatedly stated  Portugal has no claims or interests there other than wishing to conclude  in the best possible manner  the process of decolonization of all the Non-Self-Governing Territories under its administration. We believe that this can be achieved only by respect for the right of the Timorese people to self-determination and independence  as stated in resolution 1514 (XV)  applicable to all peoples under colonial domination. In the circumstances that are known to all  this can only take place through compliance with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this matter.215.	Within its limitations  my Government is ready  as it has always been  to give the United Nations all possible co-operation in this field.216.	I should like at this stage to lay before this Assembly some of the thoughts which come to our mind when we consider the history of the United Nations and the demands with which we are confronted in present-day international relations.217.	If we analyse the activities carried out by the United Nations to this day  if we try to ascertain in what fields its action is now more necessary  more urgent  we may safely conclude that the United Nations is entering a new phase of its existence.218.	This Organization was conceived and its structures drawn up during the Second World War; it started to function when memories of past tragedies and sufferings were still fresh and when consciousness of the threat of an even greater catastrophe in the event of another war was vivid. Understandably  under such circumstances the maintenance of peace and international security were the main concerns. Thus we can note that the various United Nations bodies during the first years of their existence  therefore  devoted a major part of their work to the task of trying to avoid the eruption of international conflicts or of trying to solve  through peaceful means if possible  those conflicts which could unfortunately not be avoided.219.	It is obviously not easy to evaluate the significance of the actions-or even of the mere existence-of the United Nations in the course of these events. It is difficult therefore to assess the specific contribution of the United Nations towards the prevention of a given conflict or the solution of a given crisis. It is particularly difficult to say to what extent the fact that a third world war did not break out was due to the United Nations. But we may safely conclude that the fact that we have lived in a situation of relative peace is linked to the existence  and to the actions  of the United Nations  as was the solution of many conflicts.220.	But peace and security do not constitute the sole aim of the United Nations. And if it is obvious that war has caused tragedies which human sensitivity would consider it intolerable to see repeated  it is equally obvious that situations of suffering and sacrifice persist  affecting a great part of mankind—situations which in some cases are no lighter than those brought about by war.221.	On the other hand  the attention of an international organization would naturally be focused more intensely on situations extending beyond the borders of States. The most flagrant example of this was unquestionably the case of people. not enjoying their own independence  of peoples dominated by other peoples—in short  the case of colonial situations.222.	It is therefore not surprising that  once certain structures aimed at reducing the risk of another world war had been set up  the United Nations should have launched a large-scale campaign against colonialism. It should not be forgotten that this action was prompted by solidarity  and sometimes by political interests which were not always directly related to the degree of justice or injustice prevailing in each colonial situation; but unquestionably  in my mind  these situations constituted a field in which the intervention of the United Nations was morally just  legally in accordance with the aims of the Charter  and politically viable.223.	The action of the United Nations in the field of decolonization is unfortunately not complete. There still exist situations which  owing to their dimensions and seriousness  require that the efforts undertaken in this sector be in no way weakened. But it seems that the end of the road is in sight  and it is no longer hazardous to say that the days of colonialism are numbered.224.	We have every reason to welcome the changes that have occurred in the fight against colonialism  but we must remember that victory in this field will allow the United Nations to concentrate its efforts in other fields where situations exist which the international community cannot ignore and which call for urgent and effective action.225.	The first problem to be faced  concerning which we must urgently overcome the current deadlock and achieve visible progress  is the question of disarmament.226.	We are perfectly aware of the complexity of the negotiations on disarmament. We recognize the legitimate concern of States regarding their security and defence. But the present situation is clearly unacceptable  and no one can have the slightest doubt as to the urgency of finding a solution.227.	It is therefore with renewed hope that we await the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament to be held in 1978-not because we expect it to approve sensational armament reductions  but because we feel that that session will represent an important step towards the establishment of a new mentality  of a new spirit in which these questions must be considered. For only with a new spirit can the present situation be overcome. Without it  no machinery  no negotiation  can dispel the constant threat of apocalyptic destruction under which we live.228.	While pledging the total co-operation of the Portuguese Government I appeal to all States represented here boldly and resolutely to make every effort and to use all the resources of their imaginations to find solutions to this problem  which has a decision bearing on other problems facing mankind today. We must  however  bear in mind that the factors of security essential to small nations are not always those brought forward by the great Powers.229.	I believe it can be said that the situations causing the greatest amount of suffering to mankind are mainly due to one of two reasons: to the fact that human beings arc denied the effective exercise of their legitimate rights  or to the fact that they find themselves in a position in which  even though no repressive action is exercised against them  they are unable to fulfil their most basic needs.230.	Regarding the first type of situation  the answer must be found in the defence and protection of human rights. The existence of the second type of situation underscores the need to establish a new international economic order. The two main tasks of the United Nations in the phase following decolonization must therefore be the protection of human rights and the establishment of a new economic order in the world.231.	It must of course be noted that these objectives are enshrined in the Charter and have  in one way or another  been pursued by the United Nations during all the years of its existence. The fundamental change that we believe has taken place lies in the fact that more favourable conditions now exist and that a greater sense of urgency is now being felt concerning the attainment of these objectives.232.	As regards human rights  the efficiency of the actions of the United Nations has been limited by the existence of suspicions hindering international co-operation in this field. However  we consider that unavoidable difficulties can in no way constitute an excuse for complacency or passivity.233.	To ensure the full protection of human rights and to build a new and more just economic order-those are the challenges facing mankind today. The two aspects are in our view inseparable.234.	Portugal has a very particular interest in the protection of human rights and is engaged in the process of becoming a party to a series of international instruments aimed at the effective defence of those rights. Of these I should like to recall the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and the International Covenants on Human Rights.235.	As I already had the opportunity of stressing a year ago  it is not surprising that Portugal attaches particular significance to the protection of human rights. The experience of a dictatorial regime which ignored the most elementary individual rights and guarantees has clearly shown us the importance of respecting them  and in this matter our Constitution contains clear and mandatory provisions.236.	In speaking of human rights  I cannot fail to emphasize the necessity of giving very particular attention to the protection of the human rights of migrant workers. We believe this to be a question concerning which international organizations bear special responsibilities. The Portuguese Government and its diplomacy are firmly resolved to explore all existing possibilities in this field and to seek with other countries better solutions to this problem.237.	By the same token  the establishment of a new economic order also raises some specific problems that imply the alteration of structures we have traditionally thought of as being matters within"" the internal jurisdiction of each State. In order to undertake the modification of such structures it is necessary to bear in mind that the world has become more interdependent  that the destiny of one man is increasingly linked with that of others and that the areas of international co-operation must be progressively expanded.238.	No doubt the North-South dialogue has intensified in recent years. Various institutional formulas have been attempted in the search for the necessary balance between rich and poor nations. One of the most striking examples was the Conference on International Economic Cooperation  which ended in Paris in June last. The conclusion reached—that dialogue must continue in the appropriate forums-remains important. No one can doubt that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are one of those forums  if not the principal one. The United Nations will therefore have to prepare adequate institutional arrangements to cope with such tasks. Spontaneity in the economic field is no longer acceptable.239.	In this connexion  the work taking place within the United Nations with respect to the law of the sea and a new regime for the oceans deserves a special mention.240.	Portugal continues to take an active part in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and to follow developments associated with the establishment of a new regime for the oceans of the world that will take into account both the necessities of the world community and the spirit of the new economic order.241.	We note with satisfaction the progress achieved during the sixth session of the Conference. However  we remain apprehensive concerning the difficulties that still persist in some areas  difficulties that must be overcome in a spirit of compromise so that a text containing the general consensus and representing an acceptable balance between the various positions and interests at stake can be arrived at.242.	We believe it to be of major importance that the convention codifying the new law of the sea be adopted in the near future  not only because it would represent a major contribution within the framework of the United Nations towards peace and mutual understanding but also because it would provide the small coastal States with guarantees for the respect for their rights  particularly those regarding the use of resources.243.	On the other hand  the convention would provide guarantees to the technologically developed countries andsafeguard their vital interests as maritime Powers  also assuring the security of the large investments necessary for the exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor. However  it is not sufficient to establish a new legal regime for the oceans without ensuring at the same time the institutional conditions that will facilitate its application and without contributing to the necessary international co-operation.244.	If it is true that organs that are part of the United Nations system and have competence in ocean affairs have played an important role in this area  it is also true that they have not always been able to keep up with new needs and with the changes and problems arising from new technologies. In our opinion  this gap between institutions and functions must command the attention of the higher bodies of the United Nations. Adjustments and improvements—some already under way in the specialized organs and others requiring the creation of new machinery for co-operation—should be integrated in a rational and efficient way to meet the new requirements of the international community. Priority should be given  inter alia  to increasing the aid given to Member States which need international assistance  in particular the developing nations  thereby facilitating the application of the new regime governing the oceans and ensuring that they can thus derive greater benefits for their economic and social development.245.	We thus believe that  once the Conference enters its final stage  it would be advisable for the General Assembly to consider this important matter.246.	My Government  wishing to contribute as far as it can to international co-operation  has taken the initiative of offering Lisbon as a possible site for one of the bodies that may be established as a result of the Conference on the Law of the Sea  namely  for the Law of the Sea Tribunal  and we hope that this offer will be favourably considered by the Member States.247.	Another very important role of the United Nations to which I should like to devote a few words concerns co-operation in matters which are predominantly the internal affairs of a State but which by their nature  significance or dimension transcend the boundaries of that State. My country faces such a situation today  and I should like to refer to it.248.	It is well known that decolonization of the Territories which in 1974 were under Portuguese administration led to the arrival in Portugal of hundreds of thousands of people  a number all the more impressive when we bear in mind the size and the normal population of my country. It is perhaps relevant to recall and analyse some aspects of that event.249.	First  the influx of these people was a direct consequence of decolonization  a decolonization undertaken after the revolution of 25 April 1974 in strict accordance with the objectives of the United Nations and within the framework defined in the Charter and in General Assembly resolutions  and in close co-operation with the United Nations.250.	Secondly  the people concerned come from different regions of the world and are of various nationalities.251.	Thirdly  Portugal  although aware of the problems that could arise there from  decided that the most immediate and effective means of facing the situation would be to admit those peoples into the country without placing any obstacles or barriers to their entry.252.	Fourthly  the international community  aware of the special nature of that phenomenon as well as interested in the fact that those peoples should be given the possibility of moving to a territory of their own choice  contributed financially to their transportation and even to some settlement costs.253.	From what I have just said it must be concluded that  although we are dealing with a phenomenon taking place within the borders of a given State  it is in fact something of interest and concern to the entire international community. Portugal  being the most immediate and convenient destination  did not hesitate to admit all those who sought entry  neither setting up obstacles nor imposing conditions. With regard to the subsequent expenses  it does not seem fair that Portugal alone should have to shoulder the burden of financing a task that appears to be of interest to the international community—all the more so when  bearing in mind the amount of those costs and the limited resources we possess  such a solution would impose heavy sacrifices on the Portuguese people.254.	The international community and particularly certain United Nations organs have already given us some assistance in this field. Unfortunately  the financial burden that we continue to carry appears to exceed our capabilities and it is therefore probable that  in the near future  we shall have to make  possibly in agreement and co-operation with other countries having ties with the populations concerned  an appeal for a wider participation of the international community in the solution of this problem.255.	I cannot fail in this regard to mention the agreement reached between Portugal and the People's Republic of Angola concerning the return to Angola of nationals of that country  as well as the assistance—limited though it may be given by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in connexion with the admission on Portuguese soil of persons expelled from Mozambique.256.	Last year I had the opportunity to refer to the role of the United Nations and its decision-making machinery and to point out some inherent weaknesses of that machinery. The wider sphere of action that I have just advocated for the United Nations seems to give greater urgency to this question  and it therefore also seems justified to reflect upon it once again.257.	The various United Nations organs  when adopting resolutions on matters submitted to them  must as far as possible be true interpreters of the interests of the international community. But the adoption of a resolution expressing those interests does not automatically result from the use of a given formula or a given machinery. It is therefore necessary that the various States  at such time as they concur in the expression of the will of a United Nations body  be conscious of the fact that they are agents of the international community  and that for that very reason they must neither take wholly discretionary positions nor exclusively defend their own specific interests in the matter under discussion.258.	The attainment of this objective clearly depends also on the improvement of the whole system and the acceptance of certain rules of conduct concerning the definition of positions in the United Nations. But the new element seems to lie in the political will of States to sc o it that United Nations resolutions truly reflect the interests of the international community. To ensure that  the principle of equality among States must find its maximum expression within the United Nations. Only thus can aid other universal principles on which the Organization is founded enjoy full recognition and implementation. "
"106",5785,"PRY",32,1977,"﻿260.	 Once again I am honoured to have this opportunity to address this distinguished international forum  and 1 wish briefly to put forward my Government's views on the extensive agenda before us.250. In particular  I wish to bid welcome to the eminent diplomat presiding over this Assembly  Mr. Lazar Mojsov  whom I wish every success in his difficult tasks. We are confident that his well-known competence and skill will stand him in good stead.260.	I wish also to extend our best wishes to Secretary- General Kurt Waldneim  to whom we are grateful for his tireless efforts in the service of the international community.261.	At the beginning of my statement I should also like to bid welcome to the two new States that have just joined our Organization. We hope they will find here the broad and just path leading to their well-deserved prosperity.262.	We have grown accustomed  from the news in the daily press  to hearing the word ""detente""  as if it could magically usher in a new era in international relations and in the balance of world power. However  our community is  at this very moment  gravely concerned over explosive situations liable at any moment to destroy the values of our civilization. We are not referring solely to those areas that show disturbing signs-whether real or potential-of disrupting peace and security  but also to a more indefinite  vague area where subversion  under the banner of certain ideals  has terrorized mankind in pursuit of evil designs to establish new  deceptive political systems that oppress the citizen  suppress freedom and subjugate nations.263.	More than one eminent representative of the Latin American countries has in this universal forum brought out the fact that the world is faced with an unwarranted  painful choice: while the representatives of the major Powers who hold in their hands the responsibility of power and domination proclaim the end of the cold war and its replacement by the fragile reign of detente  entire peoples are confronted dramatically by subversion and terrorism encouraged from beyond their boundaries by omnipotent forces whose designs for impeccable domination know no bounds and even extend to our continent.264.	Paraguay  which is experiencing an era of peace  security  tranquillity and order unprecedented in its turbulent political history  is concerned over this abdication of the universal conscience.265.	Paraguay  one of the vast majority of countries that do not participate in final decisions of power or domination  firmly believes in the moral values that ennoble life within the framework of order and of civilized  harmonious international coexistence.266.	My country has placed its hope in the work and historic mission of the United Nations  which is the only viable course in the search for a brighter pi object for a mankind yearning for peace and well-being.267.	Hence we view with concern the emergence of certain threats to peace and security  wherever they may occur. Technology has performed prodigious feats  and has accustomed us to a leisurely existence; technology has also turned the entire world into a village filled with suspicion  where everyone warily eyes his neighbour. And our fear grows when those sources of friction are maintained  for reasons I need not mention here  beyond the framework of the United Nations and its bodies  with criminal disregard for the provisions of the Charter specifically designed to ensure the rule of reason and law.268.	Nevertheless. Paraguay is confident that sound judgment and  above all  a spirit of justice will enable us to find proper solutions to the problems which are of concern to us all  such as the civil war in Lebanon  the situation in Cyprus  the perennial war in the Middle East  the burning issues that beset the length and breadth of Africa  and the other problems which thwart our legitimate desire to defend ideals worthy of our status as human beings.269.	Paraguay will always be prepared to support whatever measures may be adopted by the international community to curb terrorism. Here I wish to recall that the protection of human rights should apply with the same earnestness and zeal to the innocent victims of the scourge of terror which has so pitilessly been unleashed.270.	This noble concern for basic human rights  which my country shares and respects  has  however  been invoked in various United Nations bodies with narrow  biased ""selectivity"".271.	It is paradoxical that  despite the chilling figures that have been adduced regarding the unspeakable acts of genocide that take place in certain countries  on the pretext of setting up new power structures an attempt has been made to deny other peoples their sacred right to defend their self-determination  freedom and traditional life style.272.	Paraguay has taken  and will continue to take  whatever measures are needed  within a strict legal framework  to protect and defend its age-old traditions and its democratic  independent way of life. Ours is a democracy which knows no racial or other segregation  nor is there any distinction on the basis of class or wealth. Our independence is not limited by foreign or domestic forces.273.	Paraguay does not wish to live in denial of those values  because  were that to happen  life itself would no longer have the meaning and dignity which is ours by virtue of our history  a source of pride that gives us strength in the daily struggle for existence.274.	One of the more pressing items on your agenda is that of disarmament. The basis is now being laid for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on that subject in 1978. Meanwhile  the specialized agencies tell us of the enormous sums being invested in armaments— and not only by the great Powers—in a race which cannot lead the world to an era of peace and tolerance but only to a period of doubt and great danger. Conversely  economic conditions in the developing countries are deteriorating daily  in a world where the challenge of progress and well-being in most nations depends on the very triumph of failure of mankind and on a true peace.275.	Another session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea concluded recently in this very city without the land-locked countries  such as Paraguay  being assured that their just claims will be reflected in the final text of a future international convention.276.	Paraguay believes in the inalienable right of the land-locked countries to the riches of the sea  the common heritage of mankind. It is in that spirit that we wish to negotiate bilateral solutions to this exciting fundamental challenge which concerns the right of all nations to the riches of the sea.277.	My Government wishes to stress the useful and commendable efforts of our Organization as it holds plenary meetings on matters vital to man's environment throughout the world. I refer here to the United Nations Water Conference  which took place in Mar del Plata  and to the United Nations Conference on Desertification. The use of sophisticated and ambitious technology challenges nature  and it is well that the whole world should meet to deliberate these subjects which relate to the proper use of natural resources and to ensuring the healthy state of the earth's ecology; otherwise  all those who inhabit this little segment of the universe known as earth would run an even greater risk to their lives.278.	As on other occasions  the Government of Paraguay wishes to voice its satisfaction at stressing the importance of the mission being carried out in our country by UNDP  and we would express our appreciation to those countries co-operating with it which have provided their technical and financial assistance and have performed truly worthy tasks closely linked to Paraguay's development.279.	Countries like Paraguay are also concerned over the growing difficulties which  regardless of all the efforts being made inside and outside the Organization  make it particularly difficult to establish a more just international economic order wherein countries exporting raw materials and commodities can be encouraged in a way to promote their progress and the well-being of their peoples.280.	The Government of my country is constantly devoting its efforts to the harmonious development of our entire country and to the steady increase of our exports in general  but there are certain factors beyond our country which disrupt our efforts. There is the well-known problem of the low prices of raw materials on international markets. Now there are also obstacles created by industrialized countries because of prices imposed on our exports. That is true of beef exported from Paraguay. For many years now we have not had access to certain traditional markets in the European Economic Community.281.	Paraguay is also seriously concerned over another matter which has been raised at many international meetings and is a major problem within the United Nations system. There has been reference to a desire to reduce technical and financial co-operation extended to those countries that are economically ""taking off'  in favour of those that are in a less advantageous position economically. That would create automatically an intermediate level of countries which would be deprived of assistance they sorely need. In the light of views which have been put forward  one could expect that the countries involved would be practically all those of Latin America.282.	Another fact which should be mentioned on this occasion and which is also of concern to the Government of my country is the meagre representation of our countries of the Latin American group in the higher bureaucratic positions within the United Nations system  including the specialized agencies. Reliable statistics show that among 26 high positions we have absolutely no representative. The least one can say is that this unjust situation adversely affects the foundation of the United Nations system  that foundation being proportionate geographical representation.283.	Just three weeks ago in Washington the new Panama Canal treaties were signed. It was a momentous occasion in view of the presence of the Presidents or representatives of our countries  and it was evidence of our common faith and our identical hope. We welcome the fact that fruitful dialogue prevailed over sterile confrontation.284.	In conclusion  I wish to express my most sincere hope that this General Assembly will make an effective contribution to the advent of a freer  more just and more humane world for our sons and the sons of our sons. There can be no substitute for that if mankind is to continue along the path of self-betterment."
"107",5849,"QAT",32,1977,"﻿85.	 Mr. President  it gives me pleasure on behalf of my country's Minister for Foreign Affairs  who is unable to attend this important session  to offer you our most sincere and whole-hearted congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. My delegation is quite sure that your long experience  your great merits and your diplomatic tact will ensure success for this session. The positive role which your country  Yugoslavia  plays as a member of the Group of Non-Aligned Countries strengthens our faith and confidence that you will make sincere efforts to consolidate the role of the United Nations in establishing pillars of security and peace in the world.86.	I also avail myself of this opportunity to express our appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  for all the experience and tact he revealed in conducting the meetings of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.87.	It gives me great pleasure to commend the positive role that has been and is being played by the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in the fulfilment of his responsibilities and in support of the unity of the international community and its greater effectiveness in serving the issues of justice and peace.88.	On this occasion I should like on behalf of my country's delegation to welcome the delegations of the Republic of Djibouti and of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which have recently joined the United Nations. We wish them both stability and progress.89.	At present we are witnessing in the international arena crises that have not come about by accident; these crises are too sophisticated and complicated to be ignored or disregarded  and it is not mere pessimism that leads us to emphasize that it is tension and not international detente which prevails in our world. As we  representatives of the nations of the world  meet here at United Nations Headquarters  we should realize the objective and civilized difference between being part of this world Organization and being outsiders. We should realize the historic responsibility placed on all of us when we committed ourselves to the United Nations Charter  which we all accepted. We must therefore resolutely consider the true causes of the disturbing phenomenon of world tension  which we are witnessing with bitter feelings  and explicitly and firmly determine our positions regarding any party which violates or obstructs the United Nations Charter.90.	Our comments on the presence of tension and the absence of world detente would be incomplete unless we stressed before the international community the role played by the Zionist entity in causing this tension and so dragging the world to the brink of world confrontation as a result of the denial for more than 25 years of the rights of the Palestine people by this abhorrent entity based on Zionism  which the General Assembly has labelled as a form of racism and racial discrimination.91.	My country's Government emphasizes its respect for and appreciation of the just international will which backed General Assembly resolutions 3236   3375   3379 and 3376  which constitute no more than a starting-point in rectifying the historic blunder committed by the United Nations against the rights of the Palestinian people when it adopted the partition plan in 1947.92.	Speaking of the just international will  we consider it to be a synonym for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  and believe that it must necessarily and in the name of justice and the United Nations Charter assert its existence and effectiveness in respect of the establishment of peace and security in the Middle East.93.	My delegation wishes to reassert that a just and lasting peace in the Middle Hast cannot be achieved without fulfilment of the two following basic principles: first  the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 5 June 1967  including the city of Jerusalem; and  second  the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to return to their homeland* self-determination  and establishment of their independent State in Palestine through representation by the Palestine Liberation Organization. We believe that  without the fulfilment of those two principles  peace negotiations will remain meaningless in that part of the world  as long as Zionist aggression against Arab territories and against the rights of the Palestinian Arab people persists. It is deplorable that this continuing aggression is becoming worse and taking new forms. In this respect it suffices to point out only the latest provocative Zionist measures  as evidenced in the establishment of new settlements in Arab occupied territories and the attempt to impose on Arab citizens in those territories Zionist regulations which emphasize the aggressive nature of the Zionist settler colonizing entity  which aims at the eventual annexation of these occupied territories and the destruction of their character and Arab qualities.94.	To confirm this policy  the Israeli Prime Minister declared in his report to the Knesset following his recent visit to the United States  that his Government insisted on the so-called Israeli right to settlement on the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip because they are  he claims  ""liberated lands"". Hence the Israeli Government violates international laws and the right of the Palestinian Arab people to self-determination in that part of their homeland.95.	The legalization of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip and the imposition of Israeli law upon the Arab Palestinian populations  as well as the legalized affiliation of those territories to Israel  which tacitly means annexation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  reveal the expansionist intentions of Israel and its aggressive policy.96.	The policy adopted by Israel and the settlement plans being executed by it in the occupied Arab territories sustain our belief that Israel is disregarding peace plans and violating international law and United Nations resolutions  as it also imposes on the peoples of the region a perpetual state of war.97.	We sincerely call upon all countries that provide Israel with material and military aid to refrain from extending such assistance  because to continue that practice would encourage Israel in its expansionist and aggressive policy at the expense of the Palestinian Arab people and other Arab countries. To refrain from providing such aid to Israel would undoubtedly help achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the area.98.	We believe in peace and peaceful coexistence and we also believe in the right of people to self-determination and their right to live in peace. It is therefore natural for us to call upon the international community to force the Zionist entity to respect and apply all those principles. If we are to have a proper conception of the essence of international detente then the Soviet Union and the United States in particular must emphasize that the core of detente is satisfying the interests of peoples and not taking action prejudicial to them. The Middle East problem  with the question of Palestine as its core  is the real test of that detente  which we hope will play its full and positive role in serving world peace.99.	We state again that the Palestinian cause is the core of the Middle East conflict  a conflict between the racist Zionist entity and the Palestinian people  who  according to irrefutable proof available in full in the reports of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories  are exposed to the most hideous forms of humiliation and the flagrant abuse of their dignity  freedom and humanity.100.	The United Nations Charter calls on all countries to respect the rights of man  his humanity and freedom wherever he may be. But does the racist Government of South Africa respect the principles enshrined in the Charter and does it apply those principles in letter and in spirit? The tragedy of apartheid  a policy adopted by both South Africa and Rhodesia  has been one of the worst events to take place in the history of mankind  and it is one of the major crimes still being committed to this day with unusual ferocity against the black majority populations of South Africa and Rhodesia. While we find some consolation in the increasing world blockade imposed on those two racist regimes because of their inhuman policies  we believe that the United Nations and the Security Council must play a role which is much larger and more important than the mere denunciation of that policy. That role is to liquidate those two regimes  thus putting an end to them. Accordingly  we in the State of Qatar- believe that it is our duty  because of considerations involving humanity and civilization  to extend all possible aid and support to the African liberation movements  particularly those in southern Africa  so that the people may achieve their freedom and independence. In addition  we also support and praise the efforts exerted in this respect by the OAU.101.	In the same way that we call upon the international community  represented by the United Nations  to impose severe sanctions on South Africa and Rhodesia  we at the same time call for the same sanctions to be imposed on Israel  which still refuses to respect the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.102.	Our attention is drawn particularly to the increasingly close ties which have been maintained  in defiance of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  between Israel and South Africa. Those ties which link the two racist regimes have become closer  and co-operation in the political  economic  military and technological fields has been intensified in the attempt to suppress and oppress the indigenous populations.103.	The possession of nuclear weapons by Israel and South Africa and the continued co-operation of the two countries in developing them  as we see it today  and the aggressive policies of those racist regimes will not only create crises and catastrophes for the African and Arab peoples but will also threaten the world as a whole. The international community is in duty bound to meet its responsibility in the face of such irresponsible conduct  as the urgent need for a permanent and just peace for the peoples of those two areas requires.104.	My country  firmly believing in the principle of the right to self-determination and independence of all peoples denounces colonialism and racial discrimination in all their«forms and maintains that independence cannot be achieved in South Africa and Rhodesia unless majority rule is established. In support of that belief  His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani  Amir of the State of Qatar  declared on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination:""It is now time that all the efforts of world peoples and Governments should unite with the efforts of the United Nations to take positive and effective measures capable of totally eradicating this major stigma putting humanity to shame and completely eliminating the disgrace of apartheid  which tarnishes the ideals of our civilization.""105.	The lessening of international tension is a necessary prelude to international stability. It will help firmly to establish the pillars of security and peace in the world  which can only be achieved through serious and positive dialogue. From this point of view  the Cypriot crisis  which has gradually deteriorated since 1963 despite the sincere efforts exerted by the Secretary-General—efforts which we appreciate—still requires the effective involvement of our international Organization in order to establish a just solution which will preserve the security and stability of the nationals of the island and the independence and unity of Cyprus.106.	Establishing peace in order to create a suitable atmosphere for the development of the potential of nations and for the attainment of the welfare and prosperity of the world is one of the noble goals of our international Organization. To achieve that goal it is necessary to have constructive and sincere international unity.107.	We must also exert the same effort to prevent the devastating advance in nuclear weapons. International detente is still fragile and there are still several flash-points which run the risk of exploding into war. In the face of this nuclear horror  we still find countries impatiently seeking to possess such weapons  which threaten to wipe out the world and its civilization.108.	To preserve the civilization of mankind  we are obliged clearly to define in all consciousness our steps and goals in the march to the world of tomorrow in order to be able to establish peace  the goal of the United Nations to which we are all dedicated.109.	Today  therefore  we are more than ever before in dire need of making effective and joint efforts to put an end to the arms race  to confront the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to divert the effects and direction of nuclear technology to serve peaceful purposes. Today when we speak of armaments systems  disarmament and the depletion of human and material resources in financing both hot and cold wars in Africa  Latin America and the Middle East  we find that the world spends more than $300 billion annually on armaments and on the monopolistic arms trade-despite the urgent need of the world to confront the dangers of hunger  drought  ignorance  disease and poverty on our planet. Hence  we find ourselves obliged to participate jointly in strengthening the desires of the international community by working to eliminate completely those destructive weapons and the constant threat that they represent.110.	We in the State of Qatar praise and commend every step taken in that connexion and would welcome the establishment of nuclear-free zones in the Middle East  in South Asia and other areas of the world. We consider that as the beginning of comprehensive disarmament.111.	On the Middle East  we question the reasons for the obstinacy of the Zionist entity  its persistent refusal to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and its possible use of such weapons.112.	As we refer to the necessity of concluding an international treaty on the prevention and use of force in international relations and of adopting effective measure's to implement the aims and goals of disarmament  we remind the United Nations that it must do its duty with respect to solving the Middle East problem on the basis of justice and equality  including the rights of the Palestinian Arab people  who should be enabled to exercise such rights in their homeland  and not omitting their right to establish an independent  sovereign State so as to allow that struggling people to work at developing their creative capabilities and at putting an end to their misery.113.	The world of today ought to be different from the world of the past  which was ruled by the law of the jungle. Furthermore  there should be increasing understanding of the justified and urgent demands of the developing countries. Under present circumstances  international monopolies have been dividing up the regions of the world and its markets  controlling its raw materials and manipulating its potential from the turn of the century until this day. In addition to this  we must take account of rashness of the major Powers and the industrial countries  which dominate the seas and the oceans  including the gigantic wealth therein. Under such circumstances  the developing countries are deeply concerned and demand the regulation of all means relating to the use of the seas and respect of the right of regional sovereignty represented in the principle of freedom of (lie use of the seas to all countries. My Government supports and endorses anything that may lead to an international agreement to determine the law of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and how they should be exploited for the benefit of the international family through a competent international organization.114.	As a developing country  we wish to emphasize our rejection of monopolistic enterprises and the capitalistic exploitation of the seas and oceans. We urge that positive steps be taken to organize international and maritime relations among the countries of the world.115.	With great concern we refer to the increasing military ventures which are using the seas and oceans as a platform for the establishment of military and naval bases. As a result  tensions are intensified and the possibility of military confrontation will continue as well. As we refer to all that  we attach great importance to declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace far removed from international conflict.116.	The present international economic order calls for international political will to create a new and just international economic order-one that will not be an obstacle to the efforts of the developing countries to achieve growth and economic development. The new international economic order must be established on the basis of co-operation and democracy in international economic relations  rather than on the basis of monopolies and exploitation. As we see the extent of the danger of the economic gap between the industrialized and the developing countries  that danger compels the international community to realize that it must speed up its efforts to bridge that gap by creating an international economic equilibrium. Since the industrialized countries have exported to third- world countries the problems of inflation and of the increasing cost of manufactured goods; they should now rectify that error through positive co-operation and help the developing countries to overcome their development problems. We in the State of Qatar have not spared and will spare no effort to offer co-operation and assistance to all the friendly developing countries in the third world. In this connexion  my delegation wishes to express the disappointment at the failure of the Paris Conference in spite of the untiring efforts exerted to achieve positive results in that dialogue between north and south. We therefore appeal  with all sincerity  to all the developed countries to exert all possible efforts for the attainment of solutions that can play a role in achieving economic progress for the developing countries and tangible advance in the field of international economic co-operation We also reiterate our readiness to make fresh efforts within the framework of the United Nations for the achievement of the desired objectives. Here I wish to emphasize once more that my Government will continue its efforts jointly with the international community for the establishment of a new international economic order and for an improvement in the situation of the developing countries.117.	It is not impossible to solve international contradictions and conflicts in our present world under an international collective commitment to the Charter of the United Nations.118.	The establishment of democratic international relations and the fostering of those relations within United Nations organs would constitute a radical solution to all the contradictions and conflicts we are facing and would open a new horizon of peace  security  prosperity and freedom to mankind. These goals and hopes must be achieved in fulfilment of the aspirations of our peoples. It is our duty to secure the rights of future generations  in order to honour and cherish the heritage of mankind. "
"108",5895,"ROU",32,1977,"﻿31.	 In addressing the President of this distinguished forum and in expressing to you my warmest congratulations  I am addressing the representative of a country-the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia—with which Romania has excellent relations of good-neighborliness  friendship and collaboration. I hope that your mission will be crowned with a success  which will  of course  reflect also upon your country.32.	Now that Mr. Amerasinghe has concluded his term of office as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  it falls to us to acknowledge that he is leaving behind him the memory of an active President who unstintedly devoted his well-known qualities to the success of our work. For this  he has our gratitude.33.	I wish to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and hope that the new mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly at its last session will give a new impetus to the noble task he carries out with so much dedication and skill.34.	At the beginning of each autumn  representatives of Governments of the States Members of the United Nations return to this hall to make a clear analysis of the international situation and also to seek together ways and means which can bring about for our world a reign of peace  understanding and co-operation among peoples.35.	At the risk of repeating some well-known truths-in the words of the old saying  repetitio mater studiorum—l will say once again that a new spirit is emerging in the world in inter-State relations.36.	This phenomenon is due to the great changes which have occurred in the world arena  the characteristic feature of which is the clear determination of the peoples to develop as the true masters of their destinies and to co-operate in climate of peace and real understanding.37.	The attainment in these last years of the twentieth century of national independence and sovereignty by all peoples is proving to be an unalterable law of social development  a necessity of human society's advancement  a categorical imperative of history. This has been proved by experience everywhere  including the experience of the Romanian people  which this year celebrated the centennial of Romania's independence as a State-an achievement which inaugurated a new era in its thousand years of history and strongly asserting its will and determination to live free and independent.38.	Aware of the realities of the surrounding world and of the events and phenomena which characterize the evolution of the human community  the Romanian people are mobilizing their resources and capacities in an intensive effort to achieve the objectives of economic and social development which they have set themselves.39.	One of their main preoccupations this year is the effort to overcome the consequences of yet another severe trial  the third to be inflicted on it in this decade through the unleashing of the forces of nature. During the tragic moments of the catastrophic earthquake of 4 March 1977  more than 1 500 lives were lost; more than 11 000 people were injured; and more than 35 000 families were left homeless—to say nothing of the tens of thousands of houses damaged. There was extensive damage to schools  hospitals and business premises. Almost 800 units in the basic fields of industry  construction and transport were affected by the catastrophe  and valuable installations and equipment were put out of order  with a consequent substantial loss of production. There was also heavy damage to agriculture.40.	Demonstrating a high spirit of self-denial and energy  of high moral virtues and strong cohesion  the Romanian people closed ranks in a spirit of unity to overcome the difficulties  ensuring an early normalization of the economic and social life of the country in order to eliminate fully the consequences of the catastrophe and to continue their advance on the road to progress.41.	Efforts to develop and modernize the whole economy are accompanied by a lasting concern to ensure  thanks to the results achieved in the development of the national economy  an increase in the level of culture and well-being of all the people  on the one hand  and  on the other hand  continuously to strengthen the democracy of our national life through the intensification of effective participation by working people in the management of economic and social institutions and in the shaping and implementation of the State's entire policy.42.	At the same time Romania is engaged in extensive international activities  developing wide economic  political  cultural and scientific relations with all States of the world. We are endeavouring to place Romania's relations with other States on a still firmer footing  being convinced that this is in the interests of the progress of our peoples and also constitutes a contribution to the promotion of the new principles of inter-State relations and to the strengthening of detente  peace and co-operation throughout the world.43.	The two new admissions to the United Nations  which were warmly endorsed by the Romanian delegation  also have a symbolic value. The presence in this Organization of a reunified Viet Nam reminds us once again that no force on earth can overcome a people determined to secure and defend its right to a free and independent life. Romania views with sympathy  and lends its full support  to the attempt made by the friendly Vietnamese people to rebuild their country and recover from the adverse consequences of the war. Romania hopes that the moral duty of contributing to the healing of the wounds caused by the war in Viet Nam will be fulfilled.44.	The admission of the young African State  the Republic of Djibouti  recalls in turn the intensification of peoples' national liberation movements  which prefigures the near and inevitable end of the colonial system which has left a deep imprint on  and thorny problems in  contemporary international relations.45.	In Latin America  too  the struggle of the Panamanian people to recover sovereignty over their whole national territory has been marked by important success with the signing of the new Panama Canal treaty.46.	All these events rank among the revolutionary processes which are occurring in the world. Ideas about a new world of justice and equity at the national and international level have become a living reality in a number of countries that are building up with remarkable results  a new social order in Europe  Asia and Latin America. Today socialist ideas are inspiring an even great number of peoples who are showing their desire and will to embark  in one form or another  upon the socialist path of development. The small and medium-size countries and the developing and non- aligned countries reject  with increased vigour  the tendency to have them play a secondary role in international life  and they are asserting themselves ever more actively on the world scene. The movement of peoples aimed at setting up a new policy based on respect for national independence and sovereignty is growing ever stronger.47.	These profound changes which I have described create favourable conditions for the achievement of a new international order built upon the solid foundation of the principles of international law  in order to solve  in a democratic spirit and to the benefit of all nations  the great issues confronting mankind.48.	The eradication of the state of under-development which afflicts large numbers of countries is an essential imperative of the contemporary world. Undoubtedly  the decisive role in the eradication of economic backwardness devolves upon the under-developed countries themselves  through their own efforts. However  at the same time  it is essential that their efforts be supported by broad international co-operation based upon the principles of equality and justice within the framework of the new international economic order. Such an order  favouring the more rapid advancement of the developing countries  is  as was emphasized by President Ceausescu  . .. not only an essential prerequisite for the flourishing of the under-developed countries  but also a basic element for the progress of all States and for world economic stability. That is why all States and the whole human community must work in concert for the establishment of the new economic order. 49.	As a result of the initiative shown by the developing countries  in particular within the United Nations and its bodies  resolutions and programmes have been adopted which outline a number of norms and principles  as well as actions  aimed at the establishment of a new economic order and international economic co-operation. Their effectiveness depends  of course  upon the extent to which they are observed and applied by Member States. As a matter of fact  we have to admit that very little has been done in this respect. At present it is necessary to show greater determination to continue and conclude successfully the actions already started.50.	Since the setting up of a new framework for international economic relations is a problem of such vital importance to every State  it is necessary  in our view  to create conditions conducive to the participation of all States on an equal footing in all stages of the negotiations.51.	We view as a positive step the abandonment of the restricted framework of negotiations at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  the so- called  North-South dialogue   as well as the general conclusion to concentrate the debates and negotiations on the new economic order in the United Nations with the participation of all States on a democratic basis.52.	It now becomes imperative that the General Assembly plays its central role in these negotiations  ensuring a unified approach to them. In this spirit  we welcome the idea of convening a special session of the General Assembly devoted »o development and the new economic order. In our opinion  the results of all these negotiations must be translated into specific commitments by all States in the form of a code of international economic relations that should include the principles and norms governing economic relations among States  their rights and obligations in various fields of international co-operation—in trade  raw materials  energy  transport  technology  industry  agriculture  financial and credit relations-as well as establishing the machinery for giving practical effect to the commitments undertaken.53.	The new economic order implies broad and unhindered access by the developing countries to advanced technologies and to all the achievements of modern science and technology. It implies also giving those countries the required technical assistance and effective help in the training of personnel. The practice of recruiting skilled workers and specialists from the developing countries prevents the peoples concerned from solving the acute problems of their development. It is high time we put an end to such practices  and further  in the spirit of the new international economic order  arrange for the specialists who have been attracted by various means to the advanced countries to return home.54.	In our view  one suitable means organizing negotiations on all those problems could be the united Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  to take place in 1979. That Conference should develop measures for ensuring the access of the developing countries to the achievements of science and technology  for ensuring technical assistance and personnel training in all fields and for promoting and stimulating scientific research in the under-developed countries.55.	The developing countries have an important—indeed primary-role in the efforts to ensure the triumph of the new international economic order. The essential goal of that new order is to make it possible for every nation to earn its own living and exchange on a fair basis of the products of its work in its trade relations. This is a perfectly legitimate objective. The developing countries' capacity to take efficient action to this end is based on their unity and solidarity. We all know that great pressures are exerted upon those countries for the very purpose of breaking their unity and solidarity. We are confident that they will find the resources and the means to overcome those pressures.56.	Mankind's advancement requires that the establishment of a new international economic order be organically linked to the process of disarmament .57.	In our view  disarmament-above all  nuclear disarmament—is an essential problem of the contemporary era. We should all realize that the crucial moment when we must act is now  for there can be no doubt that the development of every nation  and the life and peaceful future of mankind  depend upon halting the arms race and achieving disarmament. These simple truths should be fully grasped by every inhabitant of our planet and by all nations. With the present destructive capacity of modern weapons  genuine security can only be sought through disarmament. Lasting peace is inconceivable as long as the arms race  which has now reached alarming proportions  continues. What is the basic reason for this arms race? The attainment of hypothetical balances in the level of armaments of various countries? We have no wish-I should like to make that crystal-clear—for any unilateral military advantages to be obtained by a State or group of States. But I wish to be equally clear in saying that we do' not see what hope there can be of achieving a balance based on the ever-ascending spiral of the arms race. We consider that until complete disarmament is reached  mutual security measures should be taken at ever-lower levels of armed forces and armaments. It is not by inventing new weapons-whatever the explanations put forward-that we can convince the world that we want peace  but only by putting an end to the arms race. only thus can the nations have material proof of States' good faith in their declared commitment to disarmament and the danger of war diminish.58.	The extremely harmful effects of the arms race are eloquently and scientifically described in a report entitled Economic and social consequences of the arms race and of military expenditures  which was the outcome of a Romanian initiative and which has been brought up to date this year by a group of experts 59.	We feel that the General Assembly should ensure the widest dissemination of that report with a view to keeping Governments and international public opinion informed We are convinced that this will contribute to a better understanding of the imperative need for disarmament.60.	The problems of disarmament are of course quite complex. However  it is their very complexity which  instead of being constantly invoked and regarded as an obstacle to a direct attack on those problems  should impel us to assert the political will to tackle them courageously and with the determination to reach specific disarmament measures.61.	In our view  the United Nations can and should play a greater role in this domain  and as disarmament is of vital interest to all States they should have the right and opportunity to have a say in the discussions and negotiations on all disarmament measures. That is why Romania attaches great importance to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to the problems of disarmament  to be held in May and June 1978. As a member of the Preparatory Committee  my country will do its best to create the necessary conditions for that session to give strong impetus to the nations' efforts to achieve disarmament. The session should be used for the assertion by Governments of their political will to take real steps towards disarmament.62.	Disarmament has become a basic component of European security. Unfortunately  we are compelled to state that a growing contradiction is developing in Europe between the positive steps taken so far towards detente- the expansion of political contacts and the development of economic  technical  scientific  cultural and artistic exchanges—and the continuation  or even intensification  of the arms race. There is a great concentration of weapons and troops in Europe. Four years after their inception  the Vienna negotiations have not passed the exchange-of- information  stage. The political will to achieve measures for disarmament and military disengagement in Europe has not yet emerged.63.	The corner-stone of the European security system that was outlined by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is the strict observance of the principles of international law and the removal from international relations of the policy of force and threat of force. To achieve the final elimination of this policy the need is felt to conclude an all-European treaty that should include the commitment by all the States which participated in that Conference to renounce the use or threat of force  as well as the commitment by the States possessing nuclear weapons never to use those weapons in any form against other States or groups of States. The creation of peaceful  nuclear-free zones  including one in the Balkans  would also be a valuable contribution to the cause of European security. The duty of all States signatories of the Final Act is to take action for its implementation as a whole in the shortest possible space of time. We are hopeful—at any rate we shall do our best in this direction-that the conference which is to start in Belgrade before long will give a strong impetus to the efforts along this line and will open up prospects for the unhindered development of co-operation in economic questions  technology  science and culture  as well as in other fields of humanitarian interest among the European peoples  in this context  Romania supports the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union regarding the convening of a European conference on transport  energy and environmental protection  as well as in other areas of mutual interest. 64.	Out of a spirit of responsibility for the fate of international peace and security  Romania and President Ceausescu are firmly supporting the complete renunciation of force in relations among States and the settlement of all disputes among States by peaceful means  and they are thus making an active contribution to the attainment of those objectives. Such imperatives guided Romania's action  together with that of other States  in the Security Council during its term of office as a non-permanent member.65.	Believing that force has never produced a lasting solution to any international issue but  on the contrary  has hampered the finding of a solution  Romania is doing its utmost to stimulate action in favour of a settlement of the Middle East conflict on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war  the recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination  including the right to establish a Palestinian Arab State  and the guaranteeing of the independence and sovereignty of all States in the region. We are in favour of the convening  as soon as possible  of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the countries concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the only representative of the Palestinian people. As I have already stressed on other occasions  the United Nations should play a more active role than it has played so far in the political settlement of the problems of that part of the world  and the Secretary-General of our Organization is called upon to be present in all the actions undertaken To achieve peace in the Middle East.66.	The settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the observance of the independence and sovereignty of Cyprus and the securing of the peaceful coexistence of the two Cypriot communities would do much to strengthen trust and develop peaceful co-operation in the Balkans  in Europe and throughout the world.67.	In Korea  the constructive initiatives and proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at relaxing tensions  the elimination of the North-South confrontation and the resumption of contacts and the improvement of relations between the two parts of the country offer a solid foundation for the fulfillment of the Korean people's earnest hopes for their country's peaceful  independent and democratic reunification.68.	In Africa  the tensions among certain States should be overcome at the negotiation table by action for the strengthening of the African countries' unity and collaboration  with a view to their independent economic and social advancement.69.	Romania-faithful to the ideals that prompted the long struggle waged by the Romanian people for freedom and social progress—firmly supports the struggle of all peoples still under colonial and racial domination to combat that anarchism  which is incompatible with the ethics and principles proclaimed nowadays by all peoples of the world. My country is fighting for the abolition of all forms of foreign domination over other peoples.70.	We are on the side of all oppressed peoples and we deem it our moral duty to give our full support—political  diplomatic and material-to the national liberation movements in Namibia and Zimbabwe and to the struggle of the peoples in South Africa against racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid  as well as to the independent African States that have suffered from the aggressive actions of the racist regimes.71.	In our view  present international circumstances require more determined action within the United Nations and on the international level as a whole in order to secure the liberation of the peoples of southern Africa at the earliest opportunity and to put an end  once and for all  to any encroachment upon the freedom and national rights of the African peoples and an end to any forms of domination and foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other peoples.72.	All these are extremely complex problems confronting the contemporary world. They can be solved through the active participation of all States on an equal footing within the framework of a new and democratic order. This reality is determining and strengthening the role of international organizations with a universal vocation and particularly that of the United Nations. Referring to this fact  President Ceausescu has stated: High responsibilities for the achievement of such democratic co-operation among States devolve upon the United Nations  which offers the most appropriate organizational framework for debating the issues with the effective participation of all States. Romania supports the United Nations and makes its contribution  in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization  to the finding of solutions in order that its organization and statute should better correspond to the great changes that have been occurring in the world as well as to the aspirations and expectations of all peoples.73.	We have a positive assessment of the activity carried out so far by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. The list of proposals annexed to the Committee's report this year  seems to us to be a useful basis for a continuation of the dialogue as well as for identifying measures and actions capable of leading to a greater role for the United Nations in international life. We are confident that  through the concerted endeavours of Member States  the Special Committee will be able at its forthcoming meetings to devise such measures and actions  and in this way discharge the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly. Thus  the United Nations will be able to become an instrument of co-operation available to States and show itself capable of playing an active part in the establishment of the new international economic order  in the achievement of disarmament  in the struggle against any infringements of the principles of international law  in the democratic settlement of all international issues  and in the furtherance of wide co-operation among States.74.	At the beginning of every autumn  the attention of people's is focused on this forum where the most acute issues related to international peace and co-operation are debated.75.	As at the beginning of every autumn  hopes are reviving. And our duty is to justify those hopes  to give them a positive answer  to prove  through our redoubled efforts  that mankind has entered a new era of its civilization  that men and peoples are capable of solving the most difficult problems  and that the dreadful spectre of war is moving away from us.76.	The aims that we have set ourselves are attainable; they are in the realm of the possible. However  their attainment requires political will  energy  perseverance and a dynamic and far-reaching view of the future.77.	The work of the present session of the General Assembly must go down in the history of the United Nations as a noteworthy contribution to the fulfilment of the historic mission of this forum.78.	This is the desire and will of the Romanian delegation  and all our actions will be directed towards this goal. "
"109",5941,"RUS",32,1977,"﻿108.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the Soviet Union I should like to congratulate you on the occasion of your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish you full success in the discharge of this high and responsible task.109.	At every session of the General Assembly we take satisfaction at seeing the growing ranks of States Members of the United Nations. Their number has now almost reached 150. This is yet one more indication of the positive changes occurring in world affairs. It signifies that the peoples one after another continue to gain freedom and independence  thereby confirming the inexorable advance of the process of national liberation.110.	But what matters most is that the constant influx of new Members adds to the political weight and capabilities of the United Nations and enhances the over-all potential of the policy of peace. Indeed  the main objective of all activities of the United Nations as laid down in its Charter is  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .111.	Our country made its irrevocable choice long ago. The essence of Soviet foreign policy is to ensure a peaceful  creative life for our people and peace for all people on earth. For 60 years now we have been firmly and unswervingly following this line bequeathed to us by the founder of the Soviet State  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.112.	In this year of the sixtieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution the peaceful goals and humane principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union will acquire the force of a fundamental law and as such will be enshrined in the new Constitution of the USSR.111. The same objectives are served by concrete foreign policy actions of the Soviet Union  by the initiatives which we take in international affairs. Many of them have been enunciated from this very rostrum. In a condensed form they are set forth in the programme of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of peoples  adopted by the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  the highest political forum of the party of the Soviet country.! 12. As an integral part of the world socialist system our country acts in the international arena in close unity with fraternal socialist States. We are proud that the entire world is increasingly recognizing the fact that the socialist community of States commits its growing resources and the full weight of its foreign policy on the side of fruitful co-operation among peoples  their security  and universal peace.113.	But is it not true that the work for a stronger peace is no less pressing today than it was yesterday? Indeed  it has proved possible in recent years to make headway in this direction. In various parts of the planet people have felt tangibly that it is easier to breathe  that the threat of war is receding. The process of detente is becoming pivotal to the development of international relations. But it is clear that in the current situation with its pluses and minuses intricately intertwined this process is not yet immune from delays or even reverses.114.	One cannot fail to notice that there are still forces at work in the world which do not find detente to their liking. And to say this is perhaps to put it too mildly if one takes into account how fiercely they are attacking the policy of detente.115.	Faced with a clear prospect of improvement of the international climate  certain groups are intensifying their attempts to launch an offensive to push the world back to the times of the  cold war . Those groups have a stake in an unrestrained arms race  the preservation of old centers of tensions and the creation of new ones  and the perpetuation of the remnants of colonialism and racism.116.	As a matter of fact we are confronted with the following alternative: either the world will follow the road of renouncing the use of force  the road of disarmament and equal  mutually beneficial co-operation  or it may plunge even more deeply into the arms race and find itself on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. That is why our country is laying such stress on the need to continue and consolidate detente.117.	One hears it said at times:  You know  detente is an abstract thing; nobody really knows what it is all about.  Such an argument is spurious and far-fetched. But if it is really necessary to clarify the meaning which the USSR gives to the concept of a relaxation of tensions  this has been done most authoritatively by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Leonid I. Brezhnev. He said in his speech in the city of Tula last January: Detente means  first of all the overcoming of the 'cold war' and transition to normal  stable relations amongStates; detente means willingness to resolve differences and disputes not by force  not by threats or sabre-rattling  but by peaceful means  at the conference table. Detente means a certain trust and ability to take into consideration each other's legitimate interests. 118.	Is there really anything recondite in this definition or indeed anything that could provoke objections from those who truly aspire to peace? No  there is nothing of that kind nor can. there possibly be. All this is exactly what each country should be guided by in its policy when facing the countless variety of problems posed by international life. We note with satisfaction that an - increasing number of responsible statesmen are coming to the conclusion that in a nuclear age there is no reasonable alternative to the policy of detente and peaceful coexistence.119.	The experience of recent years has shown that when States are inspired by peaceful strivings  in actual deeds and not just in words  they do find a common language in settling on actions that lead to a stronger peace. Moreover  not only do they find it  they also work quite successfully—jointly or along parallel courses—to attain this goal.120.	Indeed  the very improvement of the international climate in recent years has become possible because this was the common cause for a sizable number of countries and for political and social forces which in their world outlook and ideology often stand quite far apart but are none the less willing to co-operate for the benefit of peace.121.	The policy of detente cannot be allowed to mark time  still less to take a downward turn. It must be constantly nourished with new initiatives and brought within the reach of an ever greater number of States; in short  we must ensure what one may call the materialization of detente.122.	The United Nations has a weighty role in this respect also. All States Members of the United Nations  no matter how diverse their positions and views  are called upon to step up their efforts to deepen and strengthen detente.123.	In the conditions now shaping up in the international arena  we consider it extremely important that the United Nations and all its Member States solemnly declare their commitment to detente and use all their authority to back it up. This directly follows from the obligation to live together in peace with one another which the States Members of the United Nations assumed under the Charter.124.	If the States Members of the United Nations jointly express their political will and determination to advance the cause of detente  this will contribute to overcoming the obstacles which arise in the path of this process and to the over-all improvement of the political climate in the world. In so doing the General Assembly could determine  in terms of the present-day situation  the top priority areas in which States could exert peaceful efforts and the line of conduct which they should follow in relations with each other.125.	What  specifically  do we have in mind?126.	It is necessary  above all  scrupulously to protect the assets of detente that have already been accumulated and to prevent them from being squandered. And these assets accumulated in recent years are quite impressive. It is necessary to assist actively in the implementation of multilateral treaties and agreements which serve the interests of strengthening international security and developing peaceful relations  as well as of United Nations decisions aimed at reaching these goals. And a good many such decisions have indeed been adopted.127.	Another appropriate channel for directing efforts to the benefit of peace and peaceful relations among States is  of course  that of taking resolute steps to contain the arms race and to turn the course of events towards disarmament. What words can be found to make those responsible for the policies of their States realize the imperative need to act seriously in this area?128.	In the post-war period the arms race has been spiralling upwards continuously  but we were not the ones to cause this. This race was forced on the world by others. However  at every stage the Soviet Union proposed  backing its proposals up with concrete deeds  that an end be put to the dangerous competition and that funds be diverted to the noble endeavour of improving conditions of life for the peoples of the world. And that is still our position.129.	The Soviet proposals in the field of disarmament are well known. At the last session of the General Assembly we submitted them again in a summarized form in the memorandum of the Soviet Union on questions of ending the arms race and on disarmament. It emphasizes our willingness to search for new measures in the field of disarmament as well as to advance towards general and complete disarmament.130.	We do not in the least underestimate the significance of some constraints placed on the arms race in a number of areas in recent years. The Soviet Union has made its contribution  together with other countries  in the preparation and implementation of a whole series of relevant international treaties and agreements. These either curtail the build-up of certain types of weapons or ban the arms race in certain environments. The latest example of this is the signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques. In our view  all States without exception should accede to it if they want to support by deeds their words about peace.131.	None the less  in realistic terms very little has been done so far Actually  physical disarmament and the elimination of the material means of warfare have not even been started yet. The armies of States have not been reduced by a single aircraft or a single tank as called for in United Nations resolutions. How many good and excellent concrete proposals failed to materialize because of overt or covert sabotage by those who would not even hear of disarmament? Will they ever give thought to where they are pushing the world by incessantly whipping up war production and the arms race?132.	If one listens to the pronouncements of certain statesmen  one might even get the impression that they appear to be in favour of putting an end to tills. But what  I ask  is the actual state of affairs?133.	A closer look at what are sometimes proposed as  comprehensive  disarmament recipes would reveal that the objectives pursued are diametrically opposed to those of reaching agreements. It would seem that the intent here is roughly as follows: what about making a proposal known in advance to be unacceptable to our counterpart? He then will reject it  thereby giving us a convenient excuse  first  to blame him for that and  secondly  by invoking his rejection  to take steps to build up armaments which  in the absence of such camouflage  would appear quite unseemly.134.	Can one really on the one hand propose various  drastic reductions  while on the other hand authorizing the development of new and  bluntly speaking  merciless  terrifying types of weapons such as the neutron bomb? No wonder the world literally shuddered when it learned of the secret programmes to manufacture that weapon. How can one qualify this inhuman weapon as  humane ? After all  it is intended to be used directly against human beings and is in the same category as such cruel and barbaric means of warfare as bacteriological or chemical weapons. In our view  the United Nations must resolutely demand that the plans for the production of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction  including the neutron bomb  should be discontinued.135.	It becomes increasingly evident with each passing day that the achievement of concrete results in the field of disarmament requires the mobilization of the efforts of. all States of the world. The United Nations has a special responsibility in this regard. It must be acknowledged that the United Nations does not stand aloof as regards the disarmament problem. It has adopted a whole number of meaningful resolutions on that score. They are said to be recommendations  but if such recommendations express the will of the peoples for disarmament  it is then the duty of all Governments to be guided by them in their practical action.136.	A special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament is to be convened next year. We shall not merely have to conduct there a wide exchange of views on fundamental approaches to the disarmament problem at. the present stage but we shall also have jointly to identify the main areas where States should concentrate their priority efforts in the field of disarmament. The Soviet Union would like that session to be business-like and to help with practical preparations for a successful convening in the immediate future of a World Disarmament Conference.137.	Next  efforts in favour of detente presuppose such actions by States as would contribute to an early peaceful settlement of situations of conflict and to the preclusion of new situations of that kind from arising.138.	Acting in conformity with the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  our country continues actively to press for the elimination of the remaining hotbeds of war. Of course  the most dangerous of those is the one in the Middle East. Why is there no durable peace in that region? Simply because the principal causes of the conflict have .not been removed. Israeli troops have not been withdrawn from the Arab lands seized in 1967. The right of the Arab people of Palestine  including its right to self-determination and the creation of a State of its own  has still not been guaranteed. All of that means that the independent existence and security of all the peoples and States of that region have not been ensured.139.	Serious apprehensions are aroused by the words and deeds of the leaders of Israel. They are well known. A great deal of combustible material has been accumulated in the Middle East  and in the event of another outbreak of hostilities no one would be able to predict its outcome.140.	For its part the Soviet Union will go on doing all in its power to bring about such settlement in the Middle East as would establish a lasting peace there without infringing the legitimate rights and interests of any people or any State of the region.141.	From this high rostrum our country declares once again that we have been and remain advocates of the just cause of the Arabs whose lands have been unlawfully taken away and are still retained by force of arms. Those lands must be returned unconditionally to the Arab peoples.142.	But if there is any need to reiterate once again that Israel has a right to exist as an independent and sovereign State in the Middle East  then on behalf of the Soviet leadership  on behalf of the Soviet Union  I say again that we have always adhered and will continue to adhere to precisely that line. So why should Israel not take advantage of the opportunity that presents itself and agree to a genuinely just settlement in the Middle East? That would  after all  be in its own national interests also.143.	The Soviet Union is in favour of an early reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned  including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. There appears to exist now a broad understanding of the need to reconvene the Geneva Conference at the end of this year  but there are some who oppose it  and Israel is the main opponent. It appears that the Israeli statesmen will not bring themselves to climb one step higher  will not bring themselves closer to common sense and to the abandonment of their plans for expansion at the expense of other countries and peoples. The Soviet Union  as Co-Chairman of the Conference  intends to do its utmost to have it convened and make it work successfully  and it expects the other Co-Chairman-the United States of America-also to follow that line.144.	For more than a year now tensions have also persisted in Cyprus. No one will convince us that it is impossible to solve this problem without impairing the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It is clear that there a most intricate knot has been tied  but given goodwill it can be untied by peaceful means. The Soviet Union is prepared to facilitate this  and our relevant proposals remain valid.145.	For many years now the question of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea has been on the agenda. Is it really essential that the United Nations should admit its impotence in this respect? We think otherwise. There are quite a few possibilities for solving this question so as to prevent a potential conflict from erupting in that part of the world.146.	There is one more point to be emphasized. In conditions of detente  and in its interests  all countries are required to abide by the fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in other major international instruments. This means  in the first place  pursuing a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and settling differences and disputes by peaceful means without resorting to the threat or use of force. Experience shows that it is necessary for every country to take into account the legitimate interests of other States and to measure its actions in the international arena against the requirements of detente.147.	Naturally  all these are basic requirements. Yet  how very often do we see that even such generally recognized norms governing relations between States are violated  and frequently in the most flagrant manner.148.	A great deal has long been said about those many complications and frictions in the current international situation that are due to the fact that there are still no signs of lessening military confrontation between States or groups of States. This problem is particularly acute in Europe. But on other continents  too  there are some who simply will not abandon the policy of maintaining the old blocs and forming new aggressive blocs  a policy typical of the time of the  cold war . Attempts are made to impart a  defensive  character to certain non-military associations of States as well. And what of the persistent intention to establish more and more military bases?149.	Attempts to strengthen and expand military blocs run directly counter to the spirit of detente. The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have recently made a proposal that at least no action should be taken that could result in enlarging the existing closed groupings and political-military alliances  or creating new ones. However  the attitude of the Western countries to this initiative of the socialist States was  to put it mildly  cool. It would appear that its realization would run counter to their designs.150.	Let us take the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. These talks have now been going on for four years  and throughout all those years our Western partners in the talks have stubbornly sought to ensure for themselves unilateral military advantages and to encroach upon the security interest of the socialist countries. Therefore  these talks have so far produced no practical results. We urge that we should proceed to a real search for an understanding rather than just talk about the desire for an agreement.151.	The relaxation of tensions creates still more favourable conditions for completing  within the shortest possible time  the liberation of all colonial countries and peoples  for eliminating the racist regimes and for eradicating apartheid  the vestiges of national oppression and discrimination of all kinds. On the other hand  there is no doubt that the solution of these pending problems will give fresh momentum to the process of detente and add a new geographical dimension to it.152.	Today  colonialism is on the brink of total collapse. Conditions are improving for the further development of the struggle of peoples for their national liberation. A vivid example of this is the glorious victory of the peoples of Indo-China over imperialist aggression. That victory has opened up favourable prospects for the establishment of peace in South-East Asia and on the entire Asian continent.153.	It is with special feeling that we welcome the entry into the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Justice has been restored: the united socialist State of Viet Nam has taken its rightful place in this Organization. A large State  which has consistently taken a peaceful stand  has joined the United Nations. We whole-heartedly congratulate our Vietnamese friends.154.	We also welcome the admission of a new African State  the Republic of Djibouti.155.	When a conflict breaks out in a particular part of the world  more often than not there is  lurking in the background  either a desire to cling to colonial privileges or there are actions of a neo-colonialist nature. Let us look at what is happening in southern Africa. It is now the biggest colonialist and racist enclave in the world. An enormous majority of the population in the Republic of South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia are deprived of the most elementary human rights. This would seem to be a boundless field of activity where those who clamour for  human rights  could best apply their efforts. But for some reason or other  they shut their eyes to the intolerable plight of millions of people. What is more  they actually connive at the shameful acts of these racist regimes; they support them and cover up their crimes.156.	Speaking of Africa  some are pointing their finger at Moscow.  This is where   they allege   the tension on the continent originates . But what is our policy in Africa? We seek no privileges there for ourselves  nor do we covet concessions or bases  nor do we impose on African countries our world outlook. Our aims in Africa are independence  freedom and peace for its peoples.!157.	We do not conceal the fact that in Africa  as elsewhere  our sympathies lie with the States that have embarked on a progressive path of development  a path of social and economic transformations for the benefit of the masses. We openly declare our complete solidarity with the peoples fighting for the liquidation of the remaining strongholds of colonialism and racism. The Soviet Union will do its utmost to ensure that the desire to establish peaceful  good-neighbourly relations with one another prevails among African States as well as all other States that have gained independence  and that the sources of discord and conflict stoked up between them by imperialism and reaction be eliminated. In this connection  in Africa just as in Europe it is highly important not only to proclaim the principle of the territorial integrity of States and the inviolability of their borders but also to respect it in practice. And this applies to all parts of the world  to all continents. The violation of this principle results in armed conflicts  torrents of blood and countless sacrifices for the peoples involved in those conflicts.158.	The sooner we do away with this anachronism of our age-colonialism  racism and apartheid-the cleaner will be the air in Africa and the world at large  and the greater will be the range of action for the policy of detente. This is what was called for by the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the United 'Nations 17 years ago.159.	This is also called for in the specific decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning South African and Rhodesian racists. Those decisions must be strictly implemented by all-and I emphasize this—by all States.160.	It will not be an exaggeration to say that there is another major world problem  and if it is not solved it is difficult to expect detente to be irreversible. What I have in mind is the development of equal  mutually beneficial economic relations between all States-in short  the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.161.	I should like to stress immediately that one cannot apply to this problem a mere  geographical  yardstick. After all  it is not along meridians or parallels that the boundaries of poverty and wealth run today. What matters here is how  by whom and for what purposes the natural resources of each country are being used. What is involved here is a wide range of economic  social and political factors.162.	The Soviet Union has for a long time been making a major contribution to the building of the national economies of developing countries. Representatives of many States in this hall know this  not merely by hearsay. And we fail to understand the allegations made here and there in the West-especially after the so-called  North-South dialogue  reached an impasse-to the effect that the USSR should  as they say   lend a hand  in providing assistance to the developing countries. A strange way of putting things indeed!163.	We shall continue to give all possible assistance to the countries which have embarked on the road of independent development. But is it not clear to everyone that developing States will hardly be able to stand squarely on their feet if they remain hobbled by hundreds and thousands of tethers of neo-colonialist exploitation?164.	We resolutely support their demands that all manifestations of inequality  diktat and discrimination in international economic relations be eliminated. This was reiterated in the statement of the Soviet Government submitted to the last session of the General Assembly on restructuring international economic relations.165.	Now  a few more words about another aspect of the development of friendly relations between States. What we have in mind is cultivating the feelings of friendship and trust among all peoples  increasing mutual exchanges in cultural and other humanitarian fields. We have in mind also the need to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion  as determined  inter alia  by the International Covenants on Human Rights. this has always been our approach to these questions and it has been clearly reflected in the draft of the new Constitution of the USSR.166.	But let no one have any doubts about something else: any attempts at preaching to us  at reading us sermons or  still worse  at interfering in our internal affairs under contrived pretexts  have encountered and will always encounter a most resolute rebuff. We are ready to say this once again from this high rostrum: it is high time to realize that by acting in a spirit of psychological warfare the most that one could hope for would be to poison the international atmosphere and .to sour relations between States. We should like to think that all this will be taken seriously.167.	An exceptionally important area where the policy of detente is being implemented in practice is the sphere of bilateral relations between States. For us  this is not an abstract proposal. !t is confirmed by our consistent policy of ensuring peaceful coexistence among States belonging to different social systems.168.	For about 10 years now Soviet-French relations have been developing steadily without a hitch. the joint documents signed as a result of the recent visit of Leonid llyich Brezhnev to France convincingly demonstrate that joint actions of the two countries are making a major contribution to the cause of the relaxation of tensions and the development of co-operation in Europe and elsewhere.169.	Our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have now been brought into a normal path  which is a major accomplishment in itself if we recall how strained they were in the not-too-distant past. We intend to go on expanding and deepening our ties with the Federal Republic of Germany in various fields. It is clear  however  that everything does not depend on us. There are quarters in the Federal Republic of Germany that are still exploiting some issues in a manner which is far from conducive to the favourable development of relations between our two countries.170.	We are satisfied with the way in which our relations are shaping up with Finland  Italy  Austria  Britain and other Western European States  even though all possibilities have not yet been exhausted. Relations with those countries as well as with the other participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have now been put on a solid foundation-namely  in the principles and understandings embodied in the Final Act. The Soviet Union strictly adheres to all the provisions of that outstanding international document. We expect the same of all the other States whose highest representatives affixed their signatures to the Final Act of the Conference.171.	The meeting of representatives of the States that participated in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is due to open in Belgrade in a few days' time. We do not overestimate the significance of that meeting  nor do we underestimate it. For its part  the Soviet Union is prepared to do everything so that that meeting may proceed constructively and become yet another milestone on the road embarked upon at Helsinki.172.	Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America merit special consideration. It is difficult to conceive of further progress in the policy of detente unless there is at least a minimum of trust and mutual understanding between them. The experience of the late 1960s and the first half of the 1970s indicates that when both countries are guided by principles of equality  mutual interest in the fate of peace and non-interference in internal affairs it becomes possible not only to reach a number of major agreements and arrangements but also to establish useful co-operation in many areas.173.	Unfortunately  it must be noted that recently Soviet-American relations have experienced a certain stagnation if not a downright slump. To a somewhat lesser extent that has affected the practical aspects of bilateral ties. However  more complications have emerged now than before regarding issues of broad international concern. We  the Soviet Union  stand for the improvement of relations with the United States  for Soviet-American co-operation in the interests of our peoples  in the interests of peace. But we say just as clearly that the efforts of one side alone are not sufficient for that. In response to relevant remarks by President Carter about the desire of the United States to develop relations with the Soviet Union  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev said that if there was an intention to translate those words into the language of practical deeds we would willingly seek mutually acceptable solutions.174.	The Soviet Union invariably pursues a policy of good-neighbourly relations with Japan. Soviet-Japanese co-operation is developing successfully in a number of areas. In some other areas that is not the case. In our opinion the cause lies in the unhealthy sentiments regarding the Soviet Union that are still strong in some Japanese circles. Besides  those feelings are being whipped up by outside forces. We are convinced that the situation can and must change for the better in the interests of the peoples of our two countries and of peace in Asia.175.	For many years now Soviet-Indian relations have served as an important stabilizing factor on the vast continent of Asia. They provide a good example of friendly co-operation based upon the principles of peaceful coexistence and enshrined in the relevant treaty. It is our firm intention to continue promoting the development  intensification and enrichment of our ties with India.176.	A few words now about our relations with a large neighbouring country  China. Our position in this respect was defined by the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From the rostrum of the Congress L. I. Brezhnev stated: As regards China  as well as other countries  we adhere firmly to the principles of equality  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  non-interference in each other's internal affairs and the non-use of force. In short  we are prepared to normalize relations with China in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence.  And that position of ours remains fully valid.177.	Every State  be it in Europe or in Asia  in Africa or in Latin America  if it is guided by the interests of peace and co-operation  can rest assured that it will find a reliable partner in the USSR. In this regard we have an open mind.178.	For the Soviet Union-and we are confident this is true of others—the struggle for the deepening of detente is at the same time the struggle for the complete elimination of the risk of nuclear conflict. Widening the scope of detente means at the same time pushing back the risk of mankind's finding itself under the crushing steam-roller of a nuclear war. These are in fact two most important aspects of securing a genuinely solid and genuinely lasting peace on earth. It was precisely the atmosphere of detente that made it possible to undertake some major actions with a view to reducing the nuclear threat.179.	In this connexion one might single out the 1973 Soviet-American Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. Mention could also be made of the Soviet-French agreement to prevent the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons.11 The interests of peace require that similar agreements be concluded between all the other nuclear Powers as well.180.	However  there is still a lot more to be done than has been done. We call upon the United Nations and its Member States to continue and intensify their efforts so as to reduce step by step the likelihood of the aforementioned threat in order subsequently to remove it from the lives of human beings.181.	Of course the most radical and effective means of preventing nuclear war would be the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has favoured this course ever since that very moment when the world saw the first ominous silhouettes of nuclear explosions. Now  as before  we repeat our readiness to sit down at any time  together with all the other nuclear Powers  at the negotiating table to examine the problem of nuclear disarmament in its entirety and jointly to work out concrete ways for its practical solution.182.	But while there are no such negotiations—through no fault of our own-one cannot sit twiddling one's thumbs. Any steps would do in this respect provided they bring us closer  even by an inch or two  even gradually but steadily  to a complete removal of the threat of nuclear conflict.183.	The United Nations has played a certain role in creating a favourable political climate as regards the problem of averting a nuclear war. It suffices to recall the resolution adopted five years ago on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. And yet we should like to see a more active United Nations in this matter  which is of the greatest concern to mankind.184.	How might that look in practice?185.	Using the full weight of its prestige the United Nations could  on behalf of all its Member States  solemnly call upon all States to act in such a way as to prevent the emergence of situations which could cause a dangerous strain in relations between them and to avoid armed conflicts.186.	This applies particularly to nuclear-weapon States. What is required of them is continuous restraint in their mutual relations and a readiness to negotiate and settle their differences by peaceful means. In short  they should do all they can to prevent the emergence of conflicts and situations .which give rise to international tensions. After all  they are often but a step away from armed conflicts  and can one always guarantee that such a step will not be taken?187.	This is closely connected with strict observance of the principle of renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations involving both nuclear weapons and conventional armaments. This principle has already been enshrined in a series of recent bilateral and multilateral agreements  including the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The non-aligned movement actively advocates the establishment of this principle in relations between States.188.	The United Nations would accomplish a great deal by calling on ail States to start negotiations to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. The draft of such a treaty has been circulated among all Members of the United Nations. The replies received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the questionnaire relating to their attitude to the idea of its conclusion point to a growing interest in our proposal. We are in favour of translating this idea into reality as early as possible.189.	The joint initiative of the socialist countries advanced last November also had to do with the prevention of nuclear war. This is a proposal addressed to the countries that participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to conclude a treaty whereby each would engage not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against the others. This would be of tremendous significance not only for Europe but for the world at large. We express the hope that the States to which this initiative is addressed will adopt a serious attitude. No one should dismiss a proposal which is dictated by life itself. We shall continue to work persistently to translate into practical terms the idea of concluding such a treaty.190.	I shall mention yet another area where in our view it is possible to arrive at an agreement that would reduce the threat of war. Nuclear countries could start negotiations with a view to working out arrangements concerning the withdrawal of ships carrying nuclear weapons from certain areas of the world's oceans.191.	Other steps are also possible to curb the arms race. On a broader plane this would meet with the desire of non-nuclear States to establish zones of peace completely free from nuclear weapons. They could include both individual .countries or groups of States and vast geographical regions or even entire continents.192.	In this connexion  we reaffirm our sympathetic attitude to the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. The main prerequisite for this is the dismantling of the foreign military bases that exist there and the prevention of the establishment of new ones. It is precisely from this position that the Soviet Union approaches this idea. And it is from the same angle that we are holding consultations with the United States on certain problems relating to the Indian Ocean.193.	An extremely important question which attracts the closest attention throughout the world is the limitation of strategic arms. The need to contain the threat of nuclear war  to achieve progress in other areas of the struggle to end the arms race and for disarmament  the strengthening of international security and the further development of the process of detente call for the speediest solution of this pressing issue. And the United Nations has every right to expect from the countries participating in the talks on the limitation of strategic arms more intensive efforts for their speedy and effective completion and also to call on those States to come to a common agreement on the renunciation of the development of even more destructive systems of such weapons.194.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned  its stand is well known. The USSR has invariably sought to achieve an agreement on the limitation of strategic arms and has done and is doing everything in its power to that end. We are prepared to go even further and to proceed to negotiations on the reduction of existing stockpiled arsenals of strategic weapons.195.	What is the state of affairs in this respect'?196.	It is an open secret today that the USSR and the United States were able some time ago to agree to a considerable extent on a new Soviet-American agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms on the basis of the well-known Vladivostok agreements. Yet subsequently much of what was agreed upon has been called into question-not by us.197.	What is the reason for this? The reason is clear. What is involved here above all is the decision of the United States to begin deploying a new type of strategic weapon  the so-called cruise missiles. Thus yet another channel has been opened for the strategic arms race and of course it would be naive to think that the other side would be a passive onlooker.198.	So what will happen in the long run? Certainly not the strengthening of security-this is openly admitted even in the United States-and certainly not a reduction in military expenditures. The result will be greater rivalry  more billions which could be used far more sensibly thrown into the bottomless pit of the arms race  and consequently greater dangers for peace.199.	Even now it is not easy to reach an agreement in the field of limiting strategic arms  but the situation would become a more complicated if we had to deal with weapons whose limitation hardly lends itself or does not lend itself at all to verification by the other side. And this could spell extreme danger in the military and political fields. In this really what the USSR and the United States should strive for?200.	No  it certainly is not. It may be said with confidence that a positive conclusion of the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of strategic arms is extremely important for the peoples of our two countries  for the peoples of the entire world. As-a result of recent meetings in .Washington some progress has been achieved in bringing closer together the positions of the two sides  and this is all to the good. However  there still remain issues to be agreed upon. It is important now to ensure the prompt successful completion of the talks. I repeat that we are doing everything possible to that end in the firm belief that a mutually acceptable agreement at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks is quite feasible  of course on the basis of strict observance of the principle of the equality and equal security of the sides. We cannot back-track from this unchallengeable position.201.	While speaking of nuclear missiles  we should not forget that there may emerge new and terrifying means of the annihilation of people. Is it not true that the threat of war will increase many fold if ever more new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction are developed? Two years have elapsed since the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of an international agreement which would ban their emergence. Negotiations are under way and this of course is a positive factor  but progress has been rather slow.202.	In the meantime  ever more sophisticated means of killing people go into production from laboratories and experimental facilities. It is the duty of the United Nations to call upon all States to put a dependable road-block in the way of the emergence of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.203.	Today the problem of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is most acute. It is a fact that many States have not yet become parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and some of those countries are near-nuclear States or have already attained the capability of manufacturing such weapons. Is it really necessary  for example  to speak of the grave consequences for the security of the peoples of Africa and for universal peace which might result from actions of the Republic of South Africa taken in order to get hold of nuclear weapons? We believe that urgent and effective efforts on the part of all Member States of the United Nations are required to prevent the development of such weapons in the Republic of South Africa. We must not wait for the potential threat inherent in the spread of nuclear weapons all over the world to become a reality.204.	The Soviet Union is a convinced advocate of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Our country is already co-operating in this field with many States and we are prepared to expand that co-operation. However  we are categorically opposed to a state of affairs in which the peaceful uses of the atom would become a channel for the proliferation of nuclear weapons  and yet this is a real danger which is growing. What is required here is co-ordination of the efforts of many States and an elaborate international system of safeguards and controls. We intend to co-operate constructively in this area.205.	The prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests would be a major step towards lessening the threat of a nuclear war and deepening detente. As is well known  the Soviet Union has proposed that a treaty be concluded to this effect. Moreover  to meet the wishes of some countries we have expressed our willingness to take part in the search for a generally acceptable agreement on the question of verification. Today we are taking yet one more step forward: under an arrangement with the United States and the United Kingdom we have consented to suspend underground nuclear-weapon tests for a certain period of time even before the other nuclear Powers accede to the future treaty.206.	It is also important that the countries which have not yet acceded to the treaties on the nuclear weapon test ban in three environments  on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and on the non-emplacement of nuclear weapons on the sea-bed and in outer space /see resolution 2660(XXV)j become parties to them and  pending their accession  strictly observe the provisions of those treaties.207.	Such are the ideas regarding the key international problems-making detente stable and preventing nuclear war-which the Soviet Union deems it necessary to set forth at the current stage of the development of the international situation from the high rostrum of the United Nations.208.	Guided by these considerations  the Government of the USSR proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly  as an important and urgent question  an item entitled  Deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war .209.	At the same time  the Soviet Union is submitting for consideration by the General Assembly two draft documents: a draft declaration on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and a draft resolution on the prevention of the danger of nuclear war .210.	We should like to express the hope that the Assembly 'at this session will give thorough consideration to those documents and address a corresponding appeal to all States of the world. In the current situation in the international arena this would no doubt facilitate greater and broader efforts in favour of the security of peoples.211.	Increasingly broad opportunities to work for the benefit of peace are opening up before the United Nations in conditions of detente. The key to the success of this noble mission is the strict adherence of all the Members of tills body to the United Nations Charter. The Charter contains all that is essential for preserving and strengthening peace on earth.212.	Our country will work tirelessly for the benefit of peace  hand in hand with fraternal socialist States  together with all our allies and friends  and with the realistically minded forces which put the ensuring of peace and the prevention of the risks of war above transitory considerations. Our country will constantly labour for peace.213.	The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  recently said: The Soviet Union will always be an active participant in any negotiations or any international action aimed at developing peaceful co-operation and strengthening the security of the peoples. It is our belief-it is our firm belief—that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately prevail and that mankind will be able to step into the twenty-first century in conditions of peace  secure as never before. And we shall do all in our power to make this a reality. 214.	I trust that this appeal of the Soviet State will evoke a grateful response from those who cherish peace."
"110",5988,"RWA",32,1977,"﻿	 Mr. President  the delegation of Rwanda adds its tribute and good wishes to those which have been addressed to you on your brilliant election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and wishes it complete success. At the same time  my delegation would like to pay a particular and well-deserved tribute to your country  Yugoslavia  a firm pillar of non-alignment whose contribution to international peace and security merits recognition by the world community.2.	Your predecessor  the eminent Ambassador of Sri Lanka  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  once again deserves our great appreciation for the remarkable manner in which he discharged his responsibilities as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.3.	My country  Rwanda  has always greatly appreciated the efforts and the wisdom shown by our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in carrying out his very delicate tasks to ensure for the United Nations influence and effectiveness in keeping with its mission. Thus it is with real gratitude that I express once again the confidence of my Government in his tireless devotion to the ideals of the Charter and his personal role in bringing about the advent of a world of peace  justice and international solidarity.4.	It is with profound joy tinged with some emotion that my delegation welcomes the entry of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the young sister Republic of Djibouti into our great family.5.	We always deplored the obstruction of the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations despite the support of almost all the international community. Its admission to our Organization is a tribute to the wisdom and objectivity of those who realized that the opinion of the vast majority of the international community could no longer be opposed. Once again we salute the courage and determination of the Vietnamese people and their leaders  who by glorious combats and untold sacrifices have won their independence and their dignity and earned the consideration and respect of the whole world.6.	We reiterate our friendship and brotherhood with the valiant people of Djibouti and salute their resistance to the violence and pressures of all kinds to which they were subjected as well as the wisdom which enabled them to counter all the deceitful manoeuvres designed to obstruct the conquest of their dignity and national sovereignty.7.	The glorious history of each of these newcomers to our large family is a guarantee of their future contribution to progress towards the attainment of the objectives of our Organization.8.	Since the last session of the General Assembly the vast majority of the nations represented here have enjoyed relative peace. It is no less true that this peace continues to be endangered as long as hotbeds of tension exist and the quest for power by some among us leads them  instead of seeking to find appropriate alternatives to the relations of force and confrontation  to try to transform the conflicts into spring-boards for the attainment of political  ideological or economic interests.9.	On most of the questions which will have to be debated at the present session it seems clear that unfortunately we face the same difficulties that our efforts seem powerless to r solve. Whether it. is a matter of the problems of apartheid and racial discrimination  the agitation and dissension provoked by the ideological balance  the occupation of Arab territories by the Zionist State  the usurpation of the most inalienable rights of the Palestinian people   the dismantling of Cyprus or the occupation or arbitrary division of nations such as Germany or Korea  there has been no substantial change in the positions as we have known them in the past. The preoccupations of the international community are the same today as they were yesterday.10.	Africa  barely liberated from the most humiliating forms of the oppression and violence of colonialism  has in fact for some time been the centre of simmering armed conflict supported by barely veiled neo-colonialism  which is visibly reflected in the campaign"" for hegemony and influence and has reached its height in the lengthy blood-letting in the eastern area  today the theatre of action.11.	For 20 years  from north to south and from east to west  our continent has been the subject of continuous disturbances: mutinies  political tension  innumerable acts of aggression between brother countries fighting against each other. This phenomenon of destabilization could be attributed at the outset to the consequences of colonialism and to the difficulties of young  independent States; today it has assumed alarming proportions; it has undermined the cohesion of the African States to the extent of bringing into question their frail independence. In the light of the universal transgression of the fundamental principles of our Charter  Rwanda wishes to express its extreme concern.12.	In relation to that very important point  His Excellency Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana  President of the Rwandese Republic and Founder-President of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development  stated:""We have already on several occasions denounced and deplored this confrontation among brother countries; a confrontation that results from struggles for influence among the Great Powers. Our continent remains the scene of conflicts sustained by ideological differences. Africa has no need of these struggles. What we ask of friends who wish to help us is support in the campaign we are waging against under-development. Poverty and ignorance are our common enemy  and this struggle concerns all of us  whatever the colours under which we fight.""13.	The world will never be at peace as long as the abscess in Africa  which gnaws at the southern part of our continent  is not lanced once and for all.14.	Last year  we welcomed with some glimmer of hope the initiatives then undertaken by Washington and London to find a peaceful solution in that part of the world. But we had not considered the extreme perversity of the rebel Ian Smith and of Vorster  his neighbour.15.	Ian Smith's arrogance and obduracy have resulted in the failure of all negotiations  what can then be done other than to intensify armed struggle  since peaceful solution has failed? Nevertheless  African leaders remain willing to seize every opportunity to realize the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe for freedom and justice without bloodshed. They could not depart from that attitude unless it were from despair  as they have no interest in fanning the flames of war in the heart of their own continent.16.	But Ian Smith and his clique continue to challenge the international community by strengthening the ignominious oppression of the Zimbabwean people. Further  they continuously prepare to implement plans of aggression against neighbouring African States  that is  Botswana  Mozambique and Zambia. They will learn to their loss that these acts of intimidation against ""front-line States""  far from discouraging Africa  will but strengthen the necessary support and solidarity for the patriotic fighters of Zimbabwe.17.	Therefore it is up to Ian Smith and his allies in Pretoria to grasp the last chance offered to them to introduce the changes called for by the international community and the genuine African majority.18.	U is more than 10 years ago since the General Assembly decided to administer Namibia itself. In defiance of this decision  the racist regime of South Africa continues its illegal occupation of that Territory  which is unquestionably under the authority of the United Nations. The people of Namibia  victims of immoral tormenters  are the object of such inflictions and horrors that only the apartheid system could conceive: the corruption of puppet tribal chiefs  arrests  imprisonment  torture and the summary execution of the true representatives of the Namibian people  and many more  for which only the demented Government of Pretoria is responsible before history.19.	This already disastrous situation has created another  because it is not only a question in Namibia of the independence of a country long deprived of its rights by a usurpation of power  an illegal occupation and humiliations of every kind; the right of a nation to self-determination and to its territorial integrity is equally at stake. In fact  last August the unholy regime of Pretoria decided to annex part of the Territory of Namibia  the enclave of the port of Walvis Bay  a characteristic way that South Africa has of extending bantustanization. Need I say that this is yet another episode in making vassals of people by the economic fragmentation of those who depend on South Africa  by the creation of serfs having the nationality of artificial and unviable African States serving only as a reservoir of manpower for the South African economy. In brief  it is yet another cosmetic disguise of apartheid the essence of which is disguised under another label.20.	My delegation considers that the whole world community must do everything within its power to assist the Namibian people  represented by the South West Africa People's Organization  to win its independence and sovereignty.21.	In its hideous mantle of apartheid the South African Government  which is racist and illegal—I say ""illegal""  because legitimate power cannot be recognized without the framework of human dignity and the interests of all strata of the population-continues to impose atrocious humiliation and suffering on the black populations. Arbitrary imprisonments and the massacre of African populations are the normal procedure for preventing the majority from claiming the exercise of their inalienable rights and self- determination: Soweto in 1977 is the same as Soweto in 1976. The blood of all those martyrs would have been shed in vain if the international community did not compel Vorster and his clique to make the necessary changes imposed by the march of history.22.	To that end  the international community must strictly apply the sanctions which have been recommended against the rebel Rhodesian regime  and the total economic embargo  particularly on weapons  against South Africa. Great ills require great remedies.23.	The recommendations of the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo in May  and the more recent World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos in August  should present a valuable guide for the action to be taken to give effect to the self-determination of the oppressed people' of southern Africa today. The attainment of that objective will remain a glorious symbol of the grandeur of our Organization and of international co-operation for present and future generations.24.	A glance of the map of the world shows that it is not only Africa which is being injured in its southern and eastern parts. In the Middle East an oppressed people—the Palestinian people—is bleeding to death. Let us call on those who have the power to persuade Israel that it is in its own interest to live in an atmosphere of peace with its neighbours and that any settlement must include the restitution of the occupied Arab territories and cannot take place behind the backs of the Palestinian people  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization.25.	Cyprus too for a long time has been  as it remains  a subject of major concern of this Assembly and of our Organization. For the delegation of Rwanda  the territorial integrity and national unity of Cyprus should guide every discussion among the parties concerned  which should be free from foreign interference.26.	With regard to the divided nations  my country  Rwanda  has always hoped to be able one day to support an initiative which would assist the German people in their long march towards the unification of the two German States into one great nation. We have always hoped for this in the firm conviction that the final settlement of the German problem would constitute a very important step towards the peaceful coexistence so often proclaimed by the civilized world.27.	Likewise  the question of Korea  which since the last session has not been included in our agenda  remains no less a matter for anxiety. Our position is well known: the withdrawal of all foreign troops is an essential prerequisite to enable the Korean people to attain their dream of unification in peace.28.	The tragedy through which a divided people lives can be felt only by that people itself  and all the international community can do is promote all factors which would help towards the attainment of that inalienable aspiration to national unity. We all know that national unity in freedom is not a gift but a fundamental right.29.	In addition to the rather discouraging picture I have just drawn of the situation in certain areas of our earth  there is a certain atmosphere which continues to weigh on contemporary man  threatened as he is in his security by the weight of armaments of the most sophisticated and deadly kind. It is regrettable indeed to note that even today proliferation  both vertical and horizontal  of nuclear weapons proceeds apace  contrary to appeals for moderation and wisdom. New types of weapons are continually being developed  and nuclear technology spreads like an oil stain throughout the world. Gloomy predictions are made that by 1985 approximately 40 countries will have nuclear capability. It is intolerable that more than $300 billion should be swallowed up annually in the arms race while three quarters of mankind live in the anguish of poverty  ignorance and disease. It is not conviction of the absurdity of a nuclear war that will continue to reassure us. The continual war preparations  even in the hope that war will never be waged  are as immoral as war itself  and that is why my delegation unreservedly supports unreservedly the convening as early as possible of a special session of the General Assembly to study all the problems related to disarmament.30.	The principle of harmony and community of interests should complement the principle of international democracy in the reforms it is fitting to introduce in our Organization. In all these reforms to be effected or envisaged it is necessary that profound changes likewise take place in the minds of men  -who must perceive the objectives of the reorganization of our system. Effectiveness will depend on true reflection  not on the psychosis of an apocalypse which would follow on the division of responsibilities.31.	With regard to world economic relations  the relations of domination of the developed world over the third world have led to the definition of a new international economic order based on a world-wide democratic redistribution of power in the economic  commercial  financial and industrial sectors. The third world  faced with the constant deterioration in the terms of trade  could no longer be satisfied with simply being a provider of raw materials and energy in exchange for what amounts to alms in place of the co-operation promised by the wealthy countries. The fear of seeing the third world transformed into an equal partner in the conduct of world economic affairs might suggest to certain strategists  politicians and economists the making of a few spectacular concessions and a favourable response to specific claims in order to defer the fundamental requirements. Thus the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and the convening of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation might appear to be bold concessions.32.	But what exactly do we see today? The creative and venturesome dialogue that the third world requested has not been seriously started. It is constantly deferred to a later time. The fundamental problems remain the same  and my Head of State  Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana  President of the Rwandese Republic and Founder-President of the National Revolutionary Development Movement  recently expressed again his concern in the following terms:""At the level of international economic relations  it is regrettable to note that the present economic crisis weighs daily more heavily on the peoples of the third world. Any declaration and any programme of action will remain a dead letter in the absence of a definite commitment by the developed countries to alter the structures of world economy and trade.""The conduct of the developed countries during the latest negotiations was not fully in accordance with the declarations of good intentions they had made at the seventh special session of the United Nations General Assembly.""To be persuaded of this  it is sufficient to note how little heed was paid to the legitimate and reasonableproposals of the third-world countries formulated at the fourth session of UNCTAD and Nairobi  or at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation which  at the beginning of last June  decided that an intensified review of the many problems in abeyance should be continued within the United Nations.""33.	Along with all these timid steps  we might mention the law of the sea. The Third Conference on that subject has just concluded yet another session  pending another one  but in the most absolute silence. What was expected to be cried out loud as the greatest victory of mankind within the United Nations did not occur. Rather it was in an embarrassed silence that the representatives departed. Once again a convention on the law of the sea acceptable to all was not forthcoming. It is certainly a failure  because mankind has not been able to agree with itself on its own interests  but there is not yet nothingness  since the dialogue has not been definitely broken off.34.	The crises  the tragic divisions and the inequalities which our earth is witnessing today show how far we are from the attainment of the objectives included in the Charter of our Organization. Nevertheless  it is not Utopian to expect that the aspirations of mankind to peace  unity  freedom and universal social justice will be attained  if only in certain measure. It is to the extent that each Member State is vigilant in seeing to it that new international ethics prevail that our Organization will be strengthened and fully play its role as a privileged centre for dialogue and agreement and also for seeking the final triumph of justice and solidarity throughout the world.

"111",6034,"SAU",32,1977,"﻿ 1.	Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia I have the pleasure to preface my speech by extending to you my sincere felicitations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-second session. Your election  Mr. President  constitutes a recognition of your personal qualities and of the important role played by your country in the international field.2.	I should also like to express our appreciation of the sincere endeavours of your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  which had a positive effect on the achievements of the last session.3.	I am also very happy to express  on behalf of the  Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  our thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his untiring efforts to promote the cause of the United Nations and  consequently  to enhance its effectiveness.4.	It is also gratifying for me to associate myself with all those who preceded me in welcoming to the United Nations as new Members the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The admission of those two new States should be considered a step forward for our Organization towards achieving the goal of complete universality of membership-a source of satisfaction in view of the twilight of military and political colonialism in the world.5.	What dampens this optimism  however  and indeed leads to a pessimistic outlook is the behaviour of certainStates and regimes that enjoy membership in this Organization in practising settler colonialism  which is even more dangerous than military and political colonialism  and the violations that those States and entities commit against the purposes and objectives of the United Nations and against human rights  as well as the crimes that they commit against international peace and security. What adds to this gloom is the great number of political and economic issues that remain outstanding on our agenda and that require deliberation and eventual solution.6.	We are today witnessing a greater interaction and interdependence in the economic relations of the community of nations. Added to this are the rising expectations of the peoples of developing countries for a better life. At the same time  we are witnessing the high level of technological capability and the tremendous productive capacity of the industrialized countries. It is only when the industrial countries utilize those resources and technical proficiency for the benefit of the international community at large and offer the emerging nations just opportunities to develop in turn their own resources without exploitation that we can truly state that a new era has dawned and a noble aim of our Organization has been attained.7.	The Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation afforded an opportunity for assessing and deliberating on those problems and seeking appropriate solutions for them. It thereby reaffirmed the conviction that international co-operation was essential in erecting a sound and equitable international economic order.8.	It should be mentioned  however  that there were negative aspects—which need not be mentioned here for the sake of maintaining the spirit of co-operation—that prevented the Conference from achieving its original purpose of establishing a new and just international economic order.9.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which feels a strong sense of responsibility as a member of the international community  has spared no effort within its power to ensure that the Conference could reach the desired goal of international co-operation. My Government remains ready to play its full part in achieving those goals for the mutual benefit of the developing and developed countries. Saudi Arabia still believes that the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation continues to serve as a valid and sound basis for progress  especially since substantial groundwork has already been achieved through the procedures of the Conference.10.	It seems appropriate to mention these issues because  to a great extent  politics is directly linked to economics. Therefore  if we truly aspire to establish a new international order  whether on the economic or political level  it is imperative that world tension be diminished and the international community bear its responsibility  no matter how heavy that responsibility may be  in the light of international legality a5 defined by resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Justice must be the foundation of all deliberations in seeking solutions for issues as a means of resolving conflicts.11.	It is in this co-operative spirit that the League of Arab States has played a valuable role on the regional economic and political levels; in this way it was able to put an end to the long conflict in Lebanon  as well as to provide the assistance that was needed by the Republic of Djibouti in order to consolidate its independence in an atmosphere of tranquillity and prosperity. We must not forget its active role in setting up a fruitful dialogue between African and Arab States for the purpose of bringing about economic and political co-operation between them in order to achieve progress for those States and eventually for the whole world. I should also like to refer to the role of the League of Arab States in initiating a similar dialogue between European and Arab countries in order to achieve mutual benefits. All these roles and initiatives by the League of Arab States are undertaken in order to achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations and to strengthen the principles of its Charter and the cause of consolidating economic and political co-operation among its Members and to ensure international peace and security. I should like also to pay a tribute to the constructive role of the Islamic Conference in promoting co-operation among its members in support of the United Nations and the purposes and principles of the Charter.12.	Although these regional developments have contributed to the spread of peace and security at the international level  the continued racial and settler policies in Rhodesia  South Africa and Israel seriously threaten that peace and security. The conduct of the Governments of South Africa and Rhodesia constitute a flagrant example of the violation of human rights and of the dignity of man  since the majority of the indigenous population is deprived of the exercise of its civil and political rights despite the numerous resolutions adopted by this Organization. We indeed hope that the good offices of both the United States and the United Kingdom in seeking a peaceful solution to the problems of Rhodesia and South Africa may be brought to a successful conclusion  and thus prevent the deterioration of a situation that could lead to an explosion endangering world peace.13.	In our time  we are witnessing the most abhorrent type of colonialism  that which is exercised by the Zionist entity in Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories  where Israeli settlements are being established one after another in an attempt to rid those lands of their original and rightful inhabitants and replace them with immigrants from every part of the earth. The Zionist regime  besides changing the physical and demographic character of the occupied territories  plays havoc with the spiritual shrines of Jerusalem  which are revered by all monotheistic religions and which mean a great deal to the faithful everywhere. Those Zionist settler practices in the occupied territories constitute a danger which in itself is living proof of Israeli aggressive intentions and explicitly show no intention on Israel's part to withdraw from those territories  thereby seeking to impose a fait accompli. Such practices  accompanied as they usually are by crimes against religious values and human rights  are not new in the region and have existed since the inception of the Zionist entity in the area. What is new is that Israel  while continuing its occupation and trying to make it permanent  is at the same time proclaiming its desire for peace. Israel's conduct in Palestinian and other occupied territories on the one hand  and its obstructionist position towards peace initiatives in the Middle East on the other  offer full proof that Israel does not want or desire peace.14.	The world community  seeking an equitable and peaceful solution for the Palestinian problem and that of the Middle East  and acting through its international organizations and agencies  has adopted resolution after resolution condemning Israeli policy and conduct. It is appropriate in this context to mention the excellent and objective studies undertaken by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  as well as its recommendations  which deserve careful consideration and implementation. We extend our thanks and appreciation to that Committee for its efforts. Nevertheless  Israel is still determined that any endeavour that could lead to peace shall end in a stalemate.15.	Usurpation  violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter  ignoring General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and violating human rights in Palestinian and other Arab territories constitute Israel's infamous record in this Organization. We consider this to be an unprecedented challenge to the will of the international community  world public opinion and the free conscience of mankind. In acting thus  Israel again places squarely on the General Assembly and the Security Council their responsibilities towards the Middle East problem and the question of Palestine and their responsibility towards peace and security in the world.16.	Many of those who preceded me dealt with the question of nuclear proliferation and its dangers and the ways and means of preventing its spread. I should like to mention in this connexion the open secret of Israel's production of nuclear arms and the dire consequences arising there from. This daring and blatant act shows that Israel's energy is directed not towards peace but towards augmenting its military menace.17.	We all remember vividly the Israeli naval piracy which enabled it to obtain a shipment of plutonium. Details of this were reported prominently by the international news media and referred to in statements by officials in certain quarters. What increases the danger and gravity of this situation is the irresponsible conduct that characterizes Israel's bloody history in our region  a history of continuous aggression. That is why it is the responsibility of the world community  as represented by its specialized agencies and the States seeking the limitation of nuclear weapons  to take the measures made necessary by the importance of this matter.18.	The Palestinian people and the Arab nations believe in peace ""based on justice  since peace without justice can never prevail or endure.19.	While striving to attain a just and lasting peace the Arab nations are seeking to establish the international legitimacy of the question of Palestine and of the rights of the Palestinian people  as well as of the Middle East problem in general. The Arab nations spare no effort to pave the way for peace in the area. They have extended their co-operation to all sincere efforts in pursuit of peace within or outside the United Nations. But Israel  with its atrocious practices and aggression in the occupied Arab territories and through barbaric Zionist policies directed against the people of Palestine  international legitimacy and the march towards peace  has frustrated every effort. Thus Israel endangers the prospects of peace and security in the Middle East and brings the whole area nearer to the brink of war. Zionist policies encourage the prospect of war because peace would limit and contain Israel's illegitimate expansionist ambitions and its settler colonialism in the area.20.	In the face of these provocations the Arab countries have resolved to exercise self-restraint in order to avoid the horrors of war in the area They have concentrated on developing their economic and social resources for the benefit and in the interest of their people and in accordance with their principles and beliefs within the framework of Islamic principles and teachings  which advocate peace. What concerns us most is that the Israeli challenge may compel the Arab countries to react in order to defend themselves and to protect their legitimate rights  which can never be ignored.21.	The Arab nations call upon the international community to fulfil its responsibility by taking appropriate measures to assert its will and to support the legitimacy and the maintenance of peace  which are specifically guaranteed under the Charter of the United Nations. We call upon all States with special relations and involvement with Israel to refrain from providing Israel with military or economic support and assistance. No less important in this respect is the supply of a stream of manpower through immigration. The history of Israel has shown repeatedly that such assistance only perpetuates its aggressive intentions and its challenge to the will of the international community by continued intransigence in the face of international efforts to find a peaceful solution.22.	Thirty years ago  when the General Assembly was in the process of partitioning Palestine and creating the Zionist entity  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia delivered its solemn warning of the consequences of such action and its effect on stability  security and peace in the Middle East. After a lapse of 30 years I find myself compelled today to reiterate at this rostrum what His late Majesty King Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz Al-Saud  Minister for Foreign Affairs in Saudi Arabia at that time  said:""Remember that in the Preamble of the Charter you have pledged before God and history that you would stand firm against the aggressor and direct your effort to establish world peace and international security. Is not what is being attempted today in Palestine a case of flagrant aggression? ...""A people who want you to destroy  with your own hands  what you built up yesterday would want you to tear the Charter to pieces with no other object than the fulfilment of their own desires.""Remember that within your hands lies the establishment of peace and security in the Middle East. Likewise  within your hands lies the fomentation of disturbances and bloodshed...""Prove  gentlemen ... that you are only for right andjustice	Prove that right  justice and the halting ofaggression come before anything else	 "
"112",6070,"SDN",32,1977,"﻿253.	 Allow me at the outset to convey my sincere congratulations to Mr. Mojsov on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly  which is more than competent to hold. The ability which he has displayed and the fact that he represents a country with which the Sudan enjoys cordial and highly cherished relations make my congratulations all the more pertinent. The excellent bilateral relations which we maintain with Yugoslavia will continue to give an example of the ties that should bind developing countries. In the fold of non-alignment  this relationship has proven beyond doubt that  indeed  peoples far placed from each other can maintain and develop mutual understanding and their respective human and material resources in order that peace and security prevail in the. world. I am confident that Mr. Mojsov will guide the deliberations of this Assembly with his recognized competence and high sense of responsibility.254.	I take this opportunity also to pay a tribute to Mr. Mojsov's predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who guided our work during the last session with his wealth of knowledge and expertise. I should like to convey to him the gratitude of my country for the services which he rendered to this Organization not only through his presidency of the thirty-first session but also for his excellent guidance of the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.255.	May I also pay a special tribute to the Secretary - General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his unremitting  sincere and tireless efforts in pursuit of international peace and security. We appreciate his efforts to enhance the effectiveness of this Organization to enable it to perform with the required competence and dispatch the tremendous tasks entrusted to it.256.	We take particular pleasure and pride in welcoming in our midst today the sister Republic of Djibouti and we express our confidence that  having secured membership in the regional and political organizations to which we belong  the young Republic of Djibouti will no doubt represent an additional force in the struggle to establish peace and security not only in the Horn of Africa but also on the international level.257.	It is with an immense sense of relief that we witness today the success of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people  which culminates with the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to this Organization. In welcoming the membership of both Djibouti and Viet Nam as a giant stride towards achieving the universality of the United Nations  we sincerely wish their peoples progress and prosperity.258.	Thirty-two years have elapsed since the establishment of the Organization under whose auspices we gather today and  notwithstanding its past achievements in the maintenance of international peace and security  there still remain many problems in dire need of immediate resolution. A casual glance at the agenda items of this session provides eloquent proof of my contention. We in the Sudan maintain a hopeful attitude towards the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its international responsibilities in the various areas of its activities. More pertinently so  we in Africa express our particular appreciation to the United Nations for the helping hand which it lent us in our endeavours in the area of decolonization and the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination in the southern part of our continent.259.	We live in a world where danger looms high over some areas  and it is incumbent upon us to direct our whole attention and closely investigate the factors that make those parts of the world hotbeds of tension. In the absence of serious concern and objectivity in dealing with the problems of those areas  I am afraid that the problems will grow more difficult and complex and that the hotbeds of tension will continue to cast shadows of destruction threatening the entire world.260.	The Middle East stands high among those international hotbeds of tension  for reasons solely attributable to the continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the former's blatant refusal to recognize the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. At a time when the Arab peoples and Governments speak of peace and are seriously engaged in the search for peace in the area and persistently strive to achieve it  and while Arab leaders repeatedly emphasize their avowed desire to attain a just peace and permanent security  we are confronted by the extremists in Israel  even in this hall  raising slogans of the so-called ""liberated territories"" and the ""Jewish State"". An attitude based on the false concepts  employed to create a smoke-screen over their main objectives  that of territorial expansion at the expense of Arab States.261.	Israel owes its very creation to a resolution of this Organization and has the audacity  along with its twin State of South Africa  to disregard similar resolutions emanating from the United Nations. The record of its behaviour in the annals of this Organization shows that it remains categorically opposed to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and the noble objectives for which it was brought into being. It started its record of violations of the Charter by refusing to abide by this body's resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947-the resolution that came to be known as the ""partition resolution"". General Assembly resolution 194 (III)  which called for the return of the refugees to their lands  met with no better fate  although to this date Israel enjoys the benefits of General Assembly resolution 273 (III)  which gave it membership in the United Nations. Israel continues to pursue the verymode of conduct that has typified its record in our midst. Its recent steps  with the aim of altering the religious  demographic and geographic structure of the occupied Arab territories  stand to be considered as a perpetuation of its ultimate desire for permanent occupation and annexation.262.	Arab leaders have repeatedly and beyond doubt established their stature as avowed champions of peace and justice. It is our unswerving conviction that peace based on justice can never be attained in the Middle East unless this question is solved by securing the right of the Palestinian people to return to their land and establish their own State. That can only be achieved through the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the territories it has occupied since 5 June 1967 and the return of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty  so that the holy city may remain  as it has been for centuries  a holy shrine for Christians  Jews and Moslems  where they may freely carry out their religious practices.263.	We in the Sudan condemn this adamant position of Israel and whole-heartedly support the United Nations' efforts towards a just and peaceful resolution of this problem. Hence  we fully support the call for the immediate reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and the guardian of their aspirations.264.	Israeli practices calling for war and hatred and ignoring the existence of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights are matched only by Israel's racist ally in the South African regime. There  too  we are witnessing our African brothers being subjected to the worst kind of practices  those that violate the basic principles of human rights and are an affront to all religious standards. If the world community represented in this Assembly were to acquiesce or pretend to ignore such practices it would exacerbate the cruelty and add to the suffering of those peoples.265.	It is hardly necessary for me to repeat here the dimensions of the tribulations of our people in Azania  nor do I need to elaborate on the inherent dangers to international peace and security that those practices bring upon us. If I were to drive home a point  it would be to address a plea to the Governments of Members of this Organization  which support the inhuman Vorster regime militarily  politically  diplomatically or economically and to ask them to refrain from doing so. It is from that support that such a regime draws its ephemeral strength and it is that support  contrary as it is to the successive resolutions of this Organization  that tempts the Government of South Africa to persist in practising its abhorrent policies. Thus the efforts of this Organization to combat the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination remain devoid of any impact. That policy represents the most abhorred human practice in its vast and long history.266.	Sudan extends its unwavering support to the people of Azania in their effort to combat racism and racial discrimination and it will not desist from its moral and material support for their armed struggle against the Vorster clique. From this standpoint  we consider our effective participation in the Maputo International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  and the recent Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid  as an extension of the firm support of the Sudanese people for the people of Azania in their struggle against all forms of racial discrimination.267.	The situation in Namibia has reached a point where immediate action should be taken if the threat it imposes is to be averted.268.	Concerted international action must be initiated to compel the racist regime of South Africa to withdraw its political  military and economic presence from that area so that the Namibians under the leadership of SWAPO may assume their right to freedom and independence. It is about time that the United Nations lived up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by virtue of its administrative power. We Africans  therefore  hold the United Nations responsible for the assertion of the unity and independence of Namibia. Implementation of Security Council resolution 385 (1976) must be ensured  and we must see to it that the endeavours of the South African regime to annex Walvis Bay for the Cape region are frustrated.269.	The situation in Zimbabwe is no less dangerous than that in Namibia or Azania because of the continued practice of racial discrimination by the racist and illegal regime of Ian Smith and its adamant refusal to yield to majority rule. We support the current efforts to restore the black majority rule because Africans like all the peoples of the Arab world  sincerely wish for peace and consider the current options offered to solve the problems in Zimbabwe as a reasonable basis for further negotiations  provided they do not conflict with the continued armed struggle which aims at the overthrow of the illegal Smith regime and the restoration of full power to the people of Zimbabwe. We urge full participation by the Zimbabwean political and military leaders in the coming negotiations  since we sincerely believe them to be the genuine spokesmen of the Zimbabwean people.270.	Different political and regional forums have witnessed the fervent and persistent call of African leaders that their continent be spared international rivalry. They have repeatedly appealed to the big Powers to refrain from interfering in their internal affairs  as this has proved to be one of the main factors contributing to instability on the continent. Africans are capable of overcoming their difficulties and settling their disputes by peaceful means through a genuine African spirit of conciliation. Some big Powers  in their endeavours to establish spheres of influence in Africa  do not favour stability in the area  as this would prevent their exploitation of differences to further their own interests. That is why these Powers continue to create problems among sister African States and poison their relations as sister States  to find the opportunity directly or indirectly to interfere in the internal affairs of the African States. We demand that these Powers desist from their interference in the internal affairs of the continent and realize that our peoples  having shed their blood for the attainment of their freedom and independence  vehemently reject the recurrence of foreign influence in their countries in any form or under any pretext.271.	It is with concern and sorrow that we view the situation in Cyprus. We follow with gratitude the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to restore stability and peace in the island so that its people  both Greek and Turkish  may live peacefully in a united  independent and sovereign Cyprus. My country will spare no effort to find a solution of the problem aiming at the restoration of peace and stability among the Cypriots and at enabling Cyprus to assume its clear role among friendly peoples within the non-aligned movement.272.	The unbridled race among States to manufacture and stockpile deadly weapons is yet another important factor that leads to the creation and exacerbation of tension in our world. Developing countries note with mounting concern the extent of expenditures represented by this feverish race on the part of the super-Powers. Only last year they spent more than $US 300 billion on armaments at a time when millions of people in the developing countries are exposed to disease  famine and death. My country will have its definite views to give on the matter when the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly-of whose Preparatory Committee we have the honour to be a member-convenes next spring. However  I should like to set forth here the general views of my country on the issue as a whole.273.	First  this unbridled arms race between the two super-Powers represents the most serious threat to international peace and security.274.	Secondly  it is incumbent upon the United Nations to translate into viable action and seek implementation of the various declarations on Africa  the Middle East and southern Asia as nuclear-free zones while compelling the Governments of Israel and South Africa to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.275.	Thirdly  the United Nations should adopt urgent and effective measures aimed at the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  so that the area may be spared big-Power rivalry. We have noted with satisfaction the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to bring to an end their rival activities in the Indian Ocean. We hope that this will be the prelude to the dismantling of their respective military bases in the area in the near future. In this connexion we^ are exerting all our efforts  in co-operation with the coastal States of the Red Sea  a sea contiguous to the Indian Ocean  to spare that sea also from the risk of international rivalry in the interest of the peoples in the area.276.	It will be noted that the statements delivered before this Assembly reflect international concern over the issue of civil and political human rights. We in the Sudan give this vita' issue its due attention. However  we feel that  in addressing ourselves to the question of human rights  attention must be directed to the practices of the racist regimes in southern Africa and Israel; that is  where basic human rights are being systematically violated-and where the peoples of Azania  Zimbabwe and Palestine are subjected by South Africa  Rhodesia and Israel to humiliation and degradation because they stand up for their basic rights to freedom and independence. The tragedy of those people should not simply be the object of speeches year after year in this Assembly. More than in the past we must undertake serious and responsible action to compel those racist regimes to recognize the basic rights of those oppressed people. Failure to undertake any serious action would  I am afraid  make of our repeated references to human rights no more than rhetoric devoid of any meaning.277.	The current international economic situation is a source of great concern to my Government. The continued existence of major international economic problems  particularly those affecting the developing countries  and the lack of any significant progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order are rapidly dispelling the sense of optimism expressed by many leaders at the beginning of the year. Sudan is firmly convinced that  as long as the overwhelming majority of mankind continues to exist at the subsistence level  there will be a continuation of crises and tensions throughout the world  because the problems of peace and economic prosperity are clearly indivisible. Therefore  the concept of the new international economic order constitutes the only conceptual framework for global development from which benefits will accrue to all countries and all peoples.278.	My country notes with regret the very small progress that has been made towards the establishment of the new international economic order since its adoption by the sixth special session four years ago. With a few notable exceptions  developed countries continue to resist the implementation of the new international economic order despite their public expressions of acceptance of the concept. We in the developing countries are determined to pursue our efforts to bring about a fundamental restructuring of the existing economic order through dialogue and negotiations and not through rhetoric and confrontation. This position stems from our belief that the -present international economic order is inequitable and has contributed to the continuation of the unjust exploitation of the resources of the developing countries and keeping them at the mercy of the great industrial countries.279.	The developing countries have made serious efforts to unveil the grave dimensions of the international economic crisis besetting the world today during the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  which met for 18 months in Paris. In this respect developing countries have presented concrete and constructive proposals designed to resolve the major economic problems within the framework of the new international economic order. We must  however  note with regret that the results of the Paris Conference fell far short of meeting the aspirations and hopes of the developing countries. We appreciate the difficulties facing the developed countries in the economic  commercial and monetary fields  but at the same time we sincerely believe that developed nations have the capacity and resources to assist developing countries in all economic fields and to contribute substantially to the establishment of an equitable economic order on the basis of the decisions adopted by the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.280.	Sudan believes that the United Nations is the only forum where global economic problems can be tackled comprehensively with the hope of finding solutions in the interests of the entire international community. The limited results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation clearly show the futility of dealing with these problems on the basis of the participation of a few countries outside the global framework of the United Nations. We also believe that the United Nations Secretariat has an important role to play  particularly in providing substantive support to legislative bodies  such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council  in the adoption of resolutions and in the formulation of viable  broad policies. This would require the enhancement of the effectiveness of the United Nations economic and social sectors in order to ensure multidisciplinary approaches to development and over-all co-ordination of United Nations activities in the economic field. The United Nations is the true forum for the consideration of economic problems and in particular the establishment of a new international economic order.281.	Certain other problems  namely environmental problems  continue to hamper the efforts of many developing countries to implement their ambitious economic development plans. Sudan  together with other sister African and Arab countries  faces the serious threat of creeping deserts. The phenomenon of desertification  accompanied by a long spell of drought  has led to the loss of thousands of human beings and cattle  and continues to pose a grave threat to arable lands.282.	My country therefore attaches the greatest importance to the results of the United Nations Conference on Desertification  recently concluded in Nairobi. From this rostrum  on behalf of the Sudan and other countries suffering from the effects of desertification  we address a special appeal to the specialized agencies of the United Nations and the rich countries to help us overcome this danger that threatens the life of people  wildlife and vegetation in our countries.283.	The issues that this session of the General Assembly has to deal with are of paramount importance to the future of international relations in their various aspects  and this makes the present session of particular significance. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will live up to this high responsibility by earnestly seeking adequate solutions to the problems facing our world today.284.	There are new factors in the international arena among both developed and developing countries to which the world must give due consideration. Otherwise  what we aspire to achieve by way of international solidarity and the building of a new world where equality and genuine co-operation prevail will continue to remain beyond our reach.285.	My country firmly believes in the ultimate triumph of mankind over its problems and in its capacity to create a new world where brotherhood  equality  justice and peace prevail  and sincerely hopes that this Organisation will play its noble role in the interests of humanity and for the building of a better world. My country is strongly and faithfully committed to its responsibilities towards the achievement of this noble objective. "
"113",6116,"SEN",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  it is an honour to extend to you on behalf of the delegation of Senegal and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations and best wishes  as well as those of the Government and people of Senegal  on the occasion of your election as President of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We well know your great abilities and your vast experience  and we rely upon them for the success of this important session. In electing you the General Assembly has also paid a tribute to your country and its people for the important role they have played in affirming the policy of non-alignment and in promoting peace and security throughout the world. I can assure you that my delegation will give you its complete support in the discharge of your heavy duties.2.	On this occasion may I express my whole-hearted gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  a most talented diplomat and esteemed international personality  for the great services he has rendered our Organization and in particular for the competence and devotion with which he worked on the problems the General Assembly had before it in 1976.3.	It is also a pleasure for me to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless efforts on behalf of the world community to strengthen the chances of peace in the world and to give our Organization its proper place and role. The re-election of the Secretary- General is proof  if any were needed  of the complete confidence the international community places in him. I beg him to accept our most sincere congratulations.4.	The delegation of Senegal is participating in the present session of the General Assembly in the determination to contribute to the solution of the problems on our agenda so that the United Nations may rise to the challenge of the hopes the peoples have legitimately placed in it.1.	It is  indeed  the duty of the United Nations to be an Organization in which the States of the entire world have an opportunity to be heard and to affirm their rights and their interests in complete freedom and security. This is particularly important for small nations  whose aim is to preserve their national independence while contributing to large-scale international co-operation.2.	It is therefore a pleasure for my delegation to congratulate the Republic of Djibouti on its admission to this world Organization. We wish that brother country much success  and we are fully prepared to co-operate with it to our mutual benefit in accordance with the principle of respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of each.3.	Senegal also associates itself with those States which have expressed their pleasure at seeing the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam finally admitted to our Organization. We have always striven to that end  spurred on by our faith in the principle of universality of the United Nations and the need to take action so that the Organization may represent all peoples and all the countries of the world  whatever their economic systems.4.	With your permission  I shall now address myself to the main subjects on the agenda of this session which have been given particular attention by the Government of the Republic of Senegal. These items relate to decolonization  the maintenance of international peace and security  international economic co-operation and respect for human rights.5.	As regards decolonization  Senegal's position has always been consistent. Indeed  long before the attainment of independence by many States in the 1960s  Senegalese leaders were among the first to affirm the right of peoples to self-determination  and our country participated in the drafting of resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.6.	Senegal regarded the victories won by the peoples of Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Angola  Sao Tome  and Principe  Seychelles and Djibouti as its own. These victories have contributed much to strengthening-the cause of the freedom and independence of Africa and have profoundly shaken the last bastions of colonialism and racism still persisting on our continent. True  we cannot conceal how difficult is what has still to be done in that respect on our continent. But we are convinced that the demands of peoples for changed conditions of life and for a way out of oppression and poverty are stronger than any violence which reactionary minorities can use and that  while liberation struggles may be held back temporarily by barbaric force  there can be no doubt as to their final victory. In these circumstances  in order to prevent useless bloodshed the Organization must exercise all its influence to assist the peoples in their efforts to achieve independence  social justice and human dignity.7.	Thus  as regards the question of Mayotte  Senegal and all the members of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have denounced and continue to denounce the presence of France there. The United Nations should be able to help bring about a speedy solution of this problem before the situation deteriorates completely  with unforeseeable consequences.8.	As regards the situation in southern Africa  the picture there is a particularly sad one. Not only has our Organization not been able to act promptly to put an end to a situation which threatens international peace and security  but what is more  some of its most powerful Members refuse to assess the element of the tragedy objectively. Need I recall that the United Nations  which was established above all to safeguard international peace and security  is morally bound to take every appropriate measure to put an end to that dangerous situation? In the meantime  an explosion draws near  the struggle becomes more intense and the risk of useless violence and economic disintegration increases.9.	At any rate  regarding the decolonization of southern Africa  no one can accuse independent Africa of not having warned the international community of the aggravation of the crisis in that part of the world. The President of the Republic of Senegal  Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  in his opening address on 5 January 1976 at the Dakar International Conference on Namibia and Human Rights  declared  inter alia:""The time has come for the international community to assume its responsibilities. Is it possible that one of its Members can  in its daily conduct  run counter to its purposes and principles without  by so doing  itself bringing into question its ties with the Organization? The provisions of chapter VII of the Charter were drafted for the very purpose of preventing the conduct of any State from disturbing international public order. In the near future clear answers must be given to these questions.""These questions apply to all the parties still under domination in southern Africa.10.	In Zimbabwe  where Ian Smith claims that his regime serves democracy as defined theoretically by the white man  the actions of the racist minority are in reality the opposite of democracy  because they  the majority  the most elementary human rights  which are the very foundations of democracy.11.	Thus  because of its resolute support for the principle of total decolonization and because of the blindness of the illegal regime of Ian Smith  Senegal firmly supports the freedom fighters who constitute the nucleus of all those who are fighting in Zimbabwe. My country thus proclaims the legitimacy of the struggle of the Zimbabweans with every means at their disposal to secure the enjoyment of their rights through respect for majority rule. Yet we remain open to any initiative which could lead to a negotiated settlement of the problem. In particular  we welcome the latest decisions taken by the Security Council within the framework of the Anglo-American plan and we hope that the United Nations will take an active part in the matter so as to bring majority-rule in 1978.12.	With regard to Namibia  Senegal has always forcefully denounced the South African Government for its persistent refusal to put an end to its illegal occupation of the Territory in accordance with the repeated requests of the Security Council and the General Assembly. My country condemns in the strongest possible terms the efforts made by the South African regime to consolidate its illegal presence by creating an atmosphere of terror and intimidation in the Territory of Namibia and by using tactics based on the inhuman system of apartheid and bantustanization  which is intended to destroy the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.13.	We are in favour of any measure taken by any country to find a happy and peaceful solution to this problem and in this context we take note of the initiative made by the five Western countries. But  for the action undertaken by the latter to win our complete support  it must in no way undermine the South West Africa People's Organization.14.	Senegal unreservedly supports the position of SWAPO  which is the genuine representative of the Namibian people and which is totally opposed to any political settlement that does not meet the following prerequisites which were reaffirmed at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Libreville in July: the withdrawal of South African military and paramilitary forces from Namibia; the unconditional release of all political prisoners and the return to Namibia of all Namibian exiles; the endorsement of the United Nations Council for Namibia as an interim authority to be appointed for the Territory before its accession to complete independence; and the accession of the Territory to independence within its present boundaries  which include Walvis Bay.15.	May I take this opportunity to welcome the positive results of the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe  which was held at Maputo  Mozambique  from 16 to 21 May  and the United Nations Council for Namibia. Senegal was present at the Maputo Conference and fully supports the proposal to establish a University of Namibia and the convening by the General Assembly of a special session on Namibia. The Maputo Conference undoubtedly constituted a new stage towards the attainment of independence for those two Territories. It is to be hoped that this Assembly will take up the challenge.16.	With regard to South Africa itself  the massacres at Soweto and its aftermath  which left hundreds of dead and thousands wounded or imprisoned  served to demonstrate that white supremacy does not hesitate to use the most brutal violence  because apartheid is  by its very nature  a system which cannot be maintained other than by force. In the circumstances one might doubt whether there are means other than violence to bring about significant change.17.	Certainly Senegal continues to support all the resolutions of the OAU  of the non-aligned group and of the United Nations on the question of South Africa. In particular  we welcomed during the thirty-first session of the General Assembly the measures decided upon by the international community  which can be described as a genuine anti-apartheid code. But the problem is not only to adopt resolutions; it is essential to ensure their implementation.18.	I have discussed Africa at length because it is the continent which I know best. But I am not unaware that our region is not the only one where armed conflicts take place. The situation in the Middle East and in Palestine is one of the most serious problems confronting our world. For many years this question has regularly been included in the agenda of our Assembly  which has considered it in an effort to find a solution  or at least to lessen its gravity. As I had an opportunity to emphasize from this rostrum during the previous session of the General Assembly:""The most important result reached by the United Nations in this connexion may well be the decision taken by the international community to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the only authentic representative of the Palestinian people and to grant it observer status... It has become clear to one and all that the solution to the problems of the Middle East does not lie solely in separating the armed forces confronting each other nor in the partial or total withdrawal from the occupied territories  but rather in the settlement of the fundamental problem""19.	Along this line of thinking Senegal fully endorsed the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty- first session approving the recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. My country considered the recommendations of the Committee as a basis for the solution of the question of Palestine.20.	My country has always defended  and will continue so to do  the principle of the recovery of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. The constancy of our policy regarding the Middle East and the Palestine question was recently emphasized again by the President of the Republic of Senegal  Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  when he received Mr. Yasser Arafat at Dakar on 6 June last and said:""Senegal supports the just cause of the Arabs in general and of the Palestinians in particular. In essence  that is because we are attached to respect for the territorial integrity of States and the dignity of nations we denounce any policy which is based on the oppression of peoples and usurpation of their national rights. That is why Senegal in the United Nations  in the Organization ofAfrican Unity at meetings of the non-aligned countries  and today in the Socialist International  defends the concept of the recovery by the Arabs of their occupied territories  as well as the recognition of the rights of the Palestinians  including in particular the establishment of a Palestinian Arab State on the soil of Palestine. It is obvious that there can be no final peace in the Middle East unless both conditions are met. The ardent desire of Senegal is to have this era of stability come about soon. This justifies all efforts I am making to arrive at this objective in the interest of the parties to the conflict and  in particular  in the interests of our Arab brothers to which we black Africans are linked by so many ties.""21.	Today  while there still are a number of clouds  we continue to hope that wisdom will prevail and will lead the Israelis to respect United Nations resolutions.22.	As far as Cyprus is concerned  my delegation reaffirms its support for respect for the territorial integrity and non-alignment of that State  and for a resumption of the intercommunal negotiations leading to an egalitarian and harmonious coexistence within it.23.	The peoples of the third world have chalked up many victories won at great cost against colonialism and imperialism.24.	Nevertheless  we still are confronted not only with the heinous practices of apartheid and racism as in Africa  but also with new threats to recent independence and territorial integrity  all of which jeopardizes our right to live in freedom and dignity. That means that peace and security are not fully guaranteed to all peoples.25.	At its thirty-first session the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution reaffirming the inalienable sovereign right of every State to determine freely its political  social and economic system and its relations with other States. At the same time  it denounced any form of interference  and condemned all forms of overt subtle and highly sophisticated techniques of coercion  subversion and defamation aimed at disrupting the political  social or economic order of other States or destabilizing their Governments. But  in fact  peaceful coexistence does not yet extend to all parts of the world.26.	In this connexion  I would say that detente has generally been presented to the world as a constructive step towards promoting international security by a reduction of tensions. That work has already been begun in Europe as a result of the agreements reached at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held at Helsinki  but Senegal considers that European security is inseparable from that of the rest of the world  and that genuine peace can never prevail as long as detente is limited to Europe. We will  in fact  always wonder whether this is not a case of mutual accommodation among the great Powers to maintain the status quo of insecurity and instability elsewhere  since their immediate vicinity would be spared  while the theatre of their activities and conflicts would be displaced to other areas  threatening the security and peaceful development of the nations of those regions. A universal reduction of tensions  based on the active participation of all nations  is the best guarantee of international peace and security.27.	General and complete disarmament is one of the objectives proclaimed by the United Nations for almost three decades  but despite the many initiatives taken by the Organization in this field  the world has witnessed an unrestrained race for supremacy in destructive power.28.	For its part  Senegal attaches particular importance to measures designed to lessen the danger of nuclear war. This means that the nuclear Powers must put an end to all nuclear weapons testing and continue  in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to negotiate effective measures of nuclear disarmament. This also means that all States of the world must seriously assess the risks of a proliferation of nuclear weapons and shoulder the resulting obligations. And  when nuclear equipment and technology is transferred from one country to another  there must be ways of guaranteeing absolutely that all nuclear energy- produced in the recipient country will be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.29.	Today  more than $US 300 billion are spent annually for military purposes  while the total for assistance to development given by the rich countries to the poor represents in all only one fifteenth of that sum. These figures already indicate the gigantic and tragic waste of material and human resources in the world  a source of injustice within nations. Obviously  all these expenditures bring us no closer to the desired aim of increased collective security  whereas they could constitute a vast reservoir of resources for the attainment of a new international economic order.30.	It is easy to grasp that there is a link between disarmament and world development; consequently the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament must be bolstered.31.	In that connexion  Senegal welcomes the idea of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament questions. Such a session would allow all States Members to contribute to the strategy for a genuine disarmament  and would mark the beginning of a new and fruitful era for the survival of mankind.32.	Indeed  it is important to note the fact that resort to force in international relations is linked to the fundamental inequalities which characterize the modern world; it reflects a situation in which the weakest nations are subject to domination and interference on the part of other States.33.	Accordingly  any instrument designed to promote the non-recourse to force in international relations cannot be dissociated from the task of establishing justice and order in the relations among States. Hence any treaty must include not only provisions prohibiting the recourse to force  but also measures enabling States to prevent the causes of such recourse  as well as procedures for the settlement of disputes  freely accepted by all States.34.	Of course  such a treaty could in no way affect the right of peoples struggling for their independence to use all means at their disposal  including armed force  pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter and article 6 of the Definition of Aggression.35.	Technical and economic international co-operation is the essential complement to military security in building a world of peace. In this respect  in recent years the United Nations has been the main forum for discussions on international economic and social solidarity. The Organization has  in fact  taken up a historic challenge by clearly defining the principles which must guide our quest for a more just new international economic order. The priority given to the needs of the poor countries among the concerns of the United Nations allows us to view with optimism the future role of the world Organization.36.	Be that as it may  it is essentially because of the discussions held within the United Nations that it is now apparent to all  even to the rich countries  that the economic  social and cultural under-development of two thirds of mankind and its aggravation during the last decade  are no accident of history but largely the result of a system of international relations based on domination and exploitation of the weak. Although the recent accession to political independence of countries formerly subject to foreign tutelage has contributed to the retreat of the most visible forms of colonialism  the fact remains that the economically dependent situation of the third world has to a varying extent persisted; in some cases it has even been accentuated in recent years  in proportion to the growing inequalities in income  and hence in well-being  which is characteristic of the present-day world.37.	An analysis of production and trade conditions among developed and developing countries shows the persistence of the relationship of unequal forces which underlies international relations; it explains the obstinate refusal which for long was the response to the requests of the third world for the organization of the international market in major commodities  the principal resource of the poor countries. This also explains the singular paradox of these raw materials; the recent situation has proved how essential they are to the prosperity of the rich nations  yet they are still undervalued in relation to the capital goods and raw materials which we import from the industrial countries. To take the example of Senegal  even though it is not among the poorest countries; from 1973 to 1975  the average price of our exports rose 57 per cent  while that of our imports rose by 196 per cent. Thus in two years there has been a deterioration of 139 per cent in our terms of trade. Since then  the price of our exports has stagnated or declined  while the average price of imports continues to rise.38.	It is against that backdrop that Senegal  together with the members of the non-aligned group and the entire third world  calls for a larger contribution on the part of the developed countries to the efforts of the developing countries. This appeal is within the framework of cooperation between developed and third-world countries aimed at setting up a genuine association between them  without delay  for the sake of balanced progress.39.	Regrettably  this has not yet materialized. Indeed  only a few weeks ago  after the very mediocre results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  the so-called North-South dialogue  at Paris  the Organization for- Economic Co-operation and Development published figures which show that the efforts of the rich countries to help the developing countries continue to decline. Government assistance from the former to the latter declined from 0.36 per cent of their gross national product to 0.33 per cent  while the commitment-of the industrialized countries  which is renewed from year to year  is 0.7 per cent of the gross national product. The more time goes by  the farther we seem to be from that goal  despite the generous declarations of the rich countries.40.	Among the group of rich countries  the Scandinavian countries are the lone exception  and it is only fair to give due credit to their contribution to the development of the third-world countries.41.	The rich countries must realize that what is called aid-whether bilateral or multilateral—is not  nor can it be  a permanent solution to the economic problems of the world. The realities of our time require genuine cooperation among rich and poor countries  because it is perfectly obvious that as the number of nations that are consolidating their sovereignty over their national resources is always increasing  interdependence in every sphere of international life is becoming a fact which one must take into account. No country  no group of countries—whatever military or economic power it may have—can completely resolve its problems unilaterally and independently of the rest of the international community. It is therefore urgent for the developed countries to take decisive measures to establish a new international economic order in order to lessen the danger of a confrontation which could threaten the very life of mankind.42.	At any rate  the United Nations must continue to make sustained efforts to promote a process of real economic and social progress everywhere  in a spirit of international solidarity  so as to arrive at its final objective  namely  peace  justice and social development for all.43.	-	The quest for peace and justice also implies  first and foremost  respect for human dignity. Through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the international community assumed the responsibility of making known and defending human rights and of accepting that as a permanent obligation. In the course of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  as I pointed out:""Unfortunately  a climate of civil and civic violence flouting elementary human rights and condoned more and more by the conscience of men and peoples has arisen almost everywhere since the end of the Second World War. Our Organization  however  has failed to react to such violations  preferring rather to imitate most of the Governments which remain silent  either because they wish to spare the feelings of friendly countries or for ideological  political or other reasons under the pretext of not interfering in the internal affairs of other States.""The condemnation of such acts of violence is by no means unjustified interference because the respect of human rights is essentials to the establishment of friendly relations and relations of co-operation among States. But our Organization has as one of its tasks  as proclaimed in Article 1 of the Charter  the achievement of international co-operation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without' distinction as to race  sex  language or religion.""44.	But today  and perhaps more so than in the past  the attitude that seems always to predominate in a number of countries is scorn for the most elementary rights of the individual. Certainly human rights are a delicate subject  because they are of vital importance  and complex  because of their economic  social and political aspects  but we believe that our Organization should as early as possible discuss that problem publicly and openly in the interest of all people  including the leaders themselves  who too often seem to forget that power makes mad and that  in any case  absolute power leads to absolute madness. The events which have taken place in many countries  including the African countries  have shown that it is above all political systems which  by excluding any real possibility of opposition  limit the right of a portion of the population and create barriers to the free expression of equally free thought.45.	Certainly we are not going to preach anarchy. The construction of a nation  particularly when it emerges from colonial domination  requires some discipline from its citizens and imposes certain duties with respect to the national community. But too often this has been used as a pretext to deprive people of the most elementary freedoms and even to endanger their lives. My country cannot agree with such behaviour and will always refuse to be associated with the silence of complicity which seems to be fashionable today. But in the defence of human rights as well as in other matters  Senegal relies on the wisdom of our Organization.46.	It is this confidence that we place in the United Nations which leads us at this thirty-second session to reaffirm in all sincerity our commitment and devotion to seeking a permanent solution to the burning issues of our time  so that relations among nations may be based on genuine peaceful coexistence. Conciliation and not conflict  co-operation and not confrontation  must become the rule in these relations. It is only in this manner that our ultimate purpose  which is the establishment of a total and permanent peace with prosperity and justice throughout the world will be attained. To that end a reform of the functioning of our Organization is urgently needed.47.	In the unceasing change which is the fundamental law of our world—and this ""world has never changed as rapidly as it is doing at present—peoples and institutions must adjust to new circumstances and the United Nations is no exception.48.	The revision  or rather the adaptation  of the Charter to the present international situation  is particularly necessary at a time when many Members consider that the right of the veto is too often used against the rights of the weakest  in violation of the principles stated in the Charter. Thus  the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met at Colombo in 1976  considered that the hegemony of the great Powers in the Security Council and their use of the veto have lessened the prestige of the United Nations and the importance of its resolutions. Accordingly  that Conference invited States Members of the Organization to review the Charter  particularly with respect to the right of veto.49.	My delegation renews its support and confidence in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization  and encourages it actively to continue its work so that it may speedily conclude the task entrusted to it.50.	And yet  because of the role that it has played and still plays  our Organization  such as it is  remains the support and the hope of small nations and of the less developed nations  among which most of the third-world countries are to be found. And because of this  my country supports the United Nations and assures it of its co-operation in the accomplishment of its historic mission. "
"114",6162,"SGP",32,1977,"﻿60.	Mr. President  may I  on behalf of my Government and the delegation of Singapore  congratulate you on your election to the important office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your personal qualities as well as to your country  Yugoslavia  a leading member of the non-aligned group  of which Singapore is a member. Your election to this high office is the culmination of your brilliant career in law  journalism  diplomacy and government service. The realistic and pragmatic approach you advocated in your presidential statement for this session.61.	I should also like to thank the previous President  Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  who presided over the difficult thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly with his customary flair  intelligence  eloquence and fairness.62.	The Secretary-General has again steered the United Nations through a difficult year and our thanks and felicitations are extended to him once more. I would especially highlight the skill and tact with which he has presided over the Cyprus talks and the unpublicized good work he has undertaken in specific human rights cases and in the improvement and streamlining of the international civil service that supports the functions of the United Nations. We are indeed fortunate to have Mr. Kurt Waldheim  a man of great experience and few illusions  to hold this most difficult and thankless job.63.	This year we welcome two new Members: the first  the Republic of Djibouti  yet another new nation from Africa that is joining our ranks. I should also like to welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which happens to be a member of the region in which we live and a neighbour of ours. We extend to both our best wishes for peace and prosperity.64.	My Government welcomes the joint statement of 1 October of the American and Soviet Governments on the Middle East. We have long been convinced that the solution to the Middle East problem lies in the willingness of the Government of Israel to recognize the right of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own  and the reciprocal willingness of the Palestinians  including the PLO  to recognize the State of Israel and to respect its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. The issue of borders must be settled by negotiations on the basis of the principles of the non-acquisition of territory by the use of force and the right of States to live within secure and recognized borders. My Government remains convinced that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide the framework for the search for peace in the Middle East.65.	As for the question of southern Africa  my Government welcomes the Security Council's decision in its resolution 415 (1977) to authorize the Secretary-General to appoint a commissioner for Zimbabwe. We share the view that the United Nations should co-operate with the administering Power and the United States to help to bring about a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe. We hope that this effort to bring about a non-violent transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe will be successful. We also hope that the ongoing talks between the Government of South Africa and representatives of the five Western members of the Security Council will lead to an internationally acceptable solution in Namibia. As for South Africa itself  the abhorrent system of apartheid should give way to a new polity in which the minority will recognize the rights of the majority and the majority will respect the rights of the minority.66.	Overshadowing the issues I have briefly touched upon and  in the long run  pertinent to their resolution  is the world economic crisis which shows no sign of receding. There is a responsible body of opinion which contends that a second great depression  far more catastrophic than that of the 1930s  is possible within the next few years.67.	If this prognosis is correct  then no nation in the world can escape its consequences  and the first casualties will be among the 100 or so Members in this Assembly listed as poor and developing. For a number of the poorer countries-the so-called ""fourth world""-the consequences could be permanent crippling  economically as well as politically. The effect of the recession on the developed world so far has appeared in the emergency of some 15 million unemployed. However  without underestimating the seriousness of this to the developed world  it is nevertheless necessary to put this distress of rich nations in proper perspective. In the developed world unemployment does not entail starvation or subhuman distress. The unemployment relief conferred in the developed countries exceeds by far the normal earnings of some 30 per cent of the world's population  who are estimated to earn SUS 100 or less per year.68.	Moreover  the 15 million unemployed in the rich countries are far outnumbered by the hundreds of millions of workless who existed  and whose numbers have increased in the third world  even in the boom years.69.	In making this point  I am not minimizing the distress that unemployment is causing in the rich developed world. But whereas unemployment is a question of distress in the developed world  for some 50 per cent of mankind  employment or unemployment represents the difference between barely living and dying slowly. This is the prospect. Since the restoration of health to the world economy would require considerable self-discipline and sacrifices on the part of all nations  the point I have just made is relevant when it comes to apportioning the burden of responsibility for curing an ailing world economy.70.	I am fully aware that highlighting the greater measure of suffering in the poorer countries is not going to heighten moral sensibilities in the developed countries to a point where they would be willing to undertake sacrifices on behalf of their more desperate brethren. This is as true of rich countries as of the richer developing countries: nobody wants to help anybody else at their own expense. It is a sad fact of life that in lean times—such as those we are going through—the milk of human kindness dries up. Moral appeals make greater impact only if they are also empirically valid. Therefore the main thrust of my thesis and argument is not that the rich nations should help the poorer nations as a moral obligation but that  by helping the developing countries  they would in fact be helping themselves.71.	Clearly there is a multiplicity of causes responsible for the present crisis but  in my view  the most fundamental of all  and one which the developed countries have tended to gloss over  is that a world economy where the ratio of per capita income between rich and poor nations is about 13 to 1  where less than a third of the world's population  comprising the rich nations  generate over 70 per cent of its income  must be intrinsically unsound.72.	What is described as a global economy in fact consists largely of trade and exchange between a third—only a third—of the world's population. In 1972  before the advent of the so-called oil crisis  rich countries  with less than 30 per cent of the world's population  carried out 53 per cent of world trade among themselves.73.	As against this  the growth rate of exports of developing countries—the poorer countries-as a percentage of world trade has declined steadily since the end of the war. It fell from 31.2 per cent in 1950 to 17.4 per cent in 1972  whereas that of the Western countries rose from 60 per cent to more than 72 per cent over the same period.74.	There are as many explanations as there are economists for the present economic crisis  but it is generally agreed that the main element in the crisis is the inability of the industrial economies to expand further. The crisis is attributed to saturation of world markets and a decline in demand.75.	This is true if the world market is conceived of as being confined only to a third of the world's population. Their market has possibly reached the saturation point  and the world economic crisis will persist and worsen so long as rich countries regard the global economy and world markets largely in terms of 30 per cent of the world's population. The remedies applied so far have in fact been postulated on the basis of this fallacy  and predictably  inflation and unemployment continue to bedevil the international economic system.76.	The present economic crisis has its fundamental cause in the developed world—the rich countries—and predates the fivefold increase in the price of oil. The oil price certainly aggravated the crisis  but it did not originate the crisis.77.	The genesis of the present economic crisis antedates the oil crisis. The Bretton Woods Conference is the conventional starting-point of post-war world economic history. That Conference was certainly not perfect  but it is also true that the crisis began and intensified as the world  for political rather than economic reasons  departed from the spirit and underlying principles of the Bretton Woods agreement"". The Bretton Woods arrangement worked from the end of the war to about 1958  and it worked well. In retrospect  it is clear that the Bretton Woods arrangement was accepted  not out of deep convictions about its validity  but because in the circumstances then prevailing there was no conflict between national self-interest and its principles.78.	After the end of the Second World War  only the United States wars in a favourable position for providing the necessary international economic leadership. It had the vision and foresight to formulate policies with an international perspective based on the premise that world prosperity was indivisible. The United States made available capital and liquidity  directly and through multilateral institutions  while its industries provided the hardware for European and Japanese post-war reconstruction. In the process  American trade policies were liberalized. The most spectacular results of American aid were produced in the more advanced societies. By 1958  partly as a result of United States aid  Europe and Japan had not only fully recovered from the devastation and destruction of war  but had developed the capacity to compete with the United States.79.	The turning-point was when the dollar shortage developed into a dollar glut and the first cracks appeared in the Bretton Woods arrangement. In August 1971  the United States removed the convertibility of the dollar into gold. That was the start of the crisis. Devaluation of the dollar followed in December of the same year. In February 1973 the second dollar devaluation took place  and by March 1973 the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates had broken down.80.	Another factor responsible for expansion of the world economy until recently was the explosion of technological innovations in major industrialized countries  particularly in the United States. Those innovations brought about increases in productivity  and therefore in living standards  and further resulted in the creation of spectacular new industries like television  jet travel  digital computers  wonder drugs and synthetics. Those new industries in turn created new and better-paid jobs in industrialized countries. Unemployment therefore virtually vanished and labour shortages developed.81.	One consequence of this for the third world was the transfer from the developed to the developing countries of bio-technology industries. This transfusion was largely initiated by transnational corporations  which  in the process  forged new links in global interdependence. Investments- flowed from the industrialized countries to the developing countries  whose products were in turn exported to the industrial North.82.	Between 1965 and 1973  industrial output as a result of this in the developing countries grew by 7.3 per cent  the comparable figure for the industrialized rich countries being 4.7 per cent. So the poorer countries  despite many disappointments and blunders  were by the 1970s responding to the Western exhortation to modernize  industrialize and go in for trade—not aid.83.	Today  however  instead of congratulations and encouragement being extended to the developing countries  the cry in the rich countries now is that they must be protected from the cheap-labour products of the developing countries. Pressure is now being exerted to prevent international corporations from investing in the developing countries on the grounds that transnational are morally evil and bent on exploiting the wretched in the developing countries. Unfortunately  some third-world countries were sufficiently confused as to join this campaign to liberate the developing countries from the alleged ills caused by transnational corporations. The odd thing  however  about this campaign is that  although the transnational corporations are situated in the developed rich countries  not a single one has been shut down  either by law or industrial action.84.	The thesis that is dearly projected to the developing countries is that transnational corporations are all right for developed rich countries but bad for developing countries. However  to judge by the experience in my own country  transnational have on balance been economically beneficial. They have brought new jobs  higher earning capacity  increased skills and management expertise which we would not have been able to acquire on our own.85.	Today  new jobs are fewer in the rich countries. Among other reasons  it is because of the slackening of technological and productivity. Economic measurements of growth suggest that something like one fourth to one half of gross national product growth is attributable to technological progress. The petty world of quotas  tariffs and neo-protectionism is not going to provide the needed jobs that technological innovation can create. According to some economists  were the countries of the European Economic Community to put up trade barriers  for example  their current total of 5.5 million unemployed  far. from decreasing  would be likely to double.86.	The argument that the jobs of the workers in the developed countries are being threatened by cheap labour from poor countries is a myth. By the standards of workers in the affluent countries  wages are certainly lower in the third world. But for the workers in the poor countries  the transfer of low-technology industries has meant jobs for people who had none and the acquisition of skills that vastly increase their earning capacity. Their wages may not provide them with butter  but they do get bread.87.	So protectionism is not a defence against cheap labour; it is protection for high-cost industries. It does not create new jobs  but deprives poorer countries not only of jobs but also of the opportunity through free and fair competition to provide inflation-plagued consumers in the rich countries  with cheaper goods and therefore higher incomes. Increased earnings in the poor countries would in turn provide the incomes to buy the sophisticated industrial products of the richer countries. It is ridiculous to chant piously about interdependence and a global economy when the developing countries are denied even the opportunities to compete in the markets of the developed world on the basis of merit  quality and price. Third-world industries can survive only by selling cheaper. So protectionism is an attempt to shift the burden of unemployment on to poor nations that cannot afford even to put their jobless on the dole.88.	It is even more ridiculous that high-technology societies with highly trained labour forces should  in addition to producing jet aircraft  rocket engines  computers and other complex industrial marvels  also fight the poorer countries tooth and nail in order to produce unnecessarily expensive plastic buckets  T-shirts  shoes  undergarments  and pyjamas on the basis of protected markets. As stated by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 in their declaration issued at their meeting in New York on 29 September 1977:""The renewed trend towards protectionism in the developed countries is a cause of deep concern because of its negative impact on the export earnings of developing countries and on their terms of trade  employment policies and development efforts."" One passionately hopes that in the not-too-distant future  and well before the probable great crash  there will be an explosion of technological innovation in the developed world that will reverse trade policies whose effects would be to wipe out in the countries of the third world the pitiful advance in industrialization they have made during the last 30 years.89.	But technological innovation alone cannot restore vigour to the international economic system. If the world economy is defined in terms of  and limited to  the economies of the rich North  then there is no way out of this crisis. The capacity of the North to absorb the products of its industries and enterprises has reached the point of near saturation. The debate about the limits to growth is applicable only to the handful of rich nations. Their economies possibly can grow no further. But if the world economy is defined to include the third world  then it is only in the initial stages of growth. As I pointed out earlier  the present crisis has its origins in the fierce competition among the industrialized nations for shrinking northern markets. After all  70 per cent of the commerce of the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is among member States.90.	If the world economy is to be truly global  then the developed world must turn its attention to the 75 per cent of the world's population that remains poor but with vast untapped resources and potential markets for the goods and services of the rich countries. But  so long as that 76 per cent account for less than 20 per cent of the world's income  the markets remain potential rather than actual.91.	The development and modernization of that 75 per cent could well perform the functions that the post-war reconstruction of a war-devastated Europe and Japan performed for the world economy up till the 1970s. It is estimated that about 7 million more Americans will need to find jobs between now and 1981. France will need a million and a quarter new jobs; Japan  some 3 million new jobs. I do not know how many millions more will enter the labour market in other developed countries. Crippling the economies of the third world through protectionism will not provide new jobs in developed countries. It is more likely to increase unemployment. And at the moment the developing countries import nearly 70 per cent of their requirements from the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. If the earnings of the developing countries are reduced through protectionism  there must be a corresponding decrease in imports from the developed world.92.	The way to overcome the economic crisis  then  is for rich countries to pursue policies which will convert the great and almost unlimited needs of the developing majority of mankind into effective monetary demands. This can be done by permitting them to earn more by selling freely  and by encouraging the flow of investments into the third world to set up industries which produce goods far more cheaply. Such a policy will reduce living costs by making available cheaper goods to consumers in developed countries.93.	Equally  the increased incomes that poorer countries will earn would be spent quickly on imports from industrialized countries. In a very real sense  growing prosperity in the poorer countries will not only bring life to the listless economies of the North  but will also create demands for skilled personnel and expertise from the developed countries.94.	This  of course  requires a new sense of realism and a more responsible approach on the part of developing countries to economic development. They must accept the fact that the road to prosperity is paved with rocks rather than roses. Co-operation between the rich and poor nations should not be on the basis that the former has a moral obligation to the latter  but on the basis that each must benefit fairly from the endeavour  though not necessarily equally.95.	But my address is directed primarily to the developed nations. My criticism of their current policies is not inspired by a spirit of sterile confrontation but out of a realization that they  as well as we of the developing world  have a common interest in preserving an international economic system which is essentially sound  but which has got into difficulties largely because those who operate it have the wrong instruction manual.96.	In short  we have for the first time in human history the foundations of a world economy—not simply a Western economy. We lack the vision and the courage to think and act according to the imperatives of a world economy. Basic to a world economy is an international division of labour  not on the basis of masters and serfs  but as partners. The world economic system falters simply because those who exert the greatest influence on it are forcing it to work on behalf of the privileged nations by applying to it ancient precepts like protectionism and a kind of neo-mercantilism.97.	The world economy as now constituted requires an international division of labour it is to move forward. As one economist said recently  ""The international division of labour also comes under the law of evolution of the species.""98.	This plea to the rich nations for enlightened economic leadership may be  as one third-world leader put it at the end of a conference  a dialogue between the deaf. The capacity of the poorer nations to retaliate is limited. But their weakness — the weakness of the third world- constitutes a sort of perverse strength. Despite their powerlessness  they have the potential ability to disrupt the international economic order by simply becoming poorer and poorer. They will inevitably be pushed over the brink if the rich nations persist in their present economic policies. If and when this happens  given the logic of an interdependent world  the rich nations too must  not long after  be dragged into the abyss. Should this happen  the only bitter consolation I can offer is that a people inured to poverty and suffering for many  many decades can better endure their vicissitudes than can those accustomed to better things.

"115",6242,"SLE",32,1977,"﻿105.	 May I start  Sir  by offering you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and by pledging the co-operation of the Sierra Leone delegation in the execution of the duties of your high office.106.	I find it reassuring that the problems facing the contemporary world are being considered and discussed under your guidance. In addition to your personal qualities  you represent a country which  together with a few others  pioneered the evolution and successful establishment of the non-aligned movement which became  and still is  a strong moderating force on the harsh ideological struggle and sterile military competitiveness of the super-Powers. With your outstanding diplomatic and international experience and your experience as your country's Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs  we are assured  Mr. President  that you are well placed to execute the task of steering the General Assembly through its thirty-second session.107.	Secondly  Mr. President  permit me to express my Government's recognition and appreciation of the invaluable role played by Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka when he was serving in the position you now occupy. His contribution to the work of the United Nations and to international understanding in general goes some way beyond his presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly. Difficult as his task was  Mr. Amerasinghe also very ably presided over the law of the sea Conference and the Ad Hoc committee on the Indian Ocean. His efforts contributed greatly to bringing about some measure of understanding among the nations of the world on issues some of which are of an intricate nature and of vital concern to the international community.108.	This current session marks the admission to membership in our Organization of two new Members  namely  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. In the view of my delegation  this event is more than a merely formal act. In the case of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  after a long and destructive period of internecine conflict exacerbated by external involvement  it is decidedly with universal approbation that this great and heroic country takes its rightful place in the council of nations. In the case of the Republic of Djibouti  its accession to membership marks yet another step in the inexorable march of all peoples to the goal of self- determination. In admitting these two States to the United Nations  our Organization has-given yet another positive testimony to its adherence to the principle of the universality of membership. It is in this spirit that Sierra Leone welcomes these two new countries into the ranks of our Organization  secure in the belief that they both will contribute constructively to our collective search for solutions to our common global problems.109.	The issues which will dominate this session are not new. Some of them are as old as the United Nations itself. The fact that we continue to discuss them means that we are all determined to arrive at some solution. The world is beset with problems  among which the inequality of opportunity in satisfying the most basic human needs should be of primary concern. Furthermore  we are compelled to contend with the reinforcement of bastions of racism and the denial of basic human freedoms and fundamental rights to millions of people all over the world. This situation has been aggravated by the unbridled accumulation by nations  both large and small  of weapons of mass destruction. We entertain the hope that under your presidency  Sir  solutions will be devised to accommodate the differences that have long divided us.110.	Significant among the issues before the Assembly is the grave threat to world peace and security  which  every minute  even as we sit here now  looms above in southern Africa like a gathering storm. Almost every year  shortly before this body is scheduled to meet  there is a flurry of diplomatic activity which quietly dies down with the closing of the session. Whether at this podium  as I stand here  or in State capitals all over the world  representatives of governments loudly proclaim their support for efforts at ending South Africa's illegal presence in Namibia  bringing down the illegal regime of Ian Smith in Zimbabwe and putting an end to the odious crime of apartheid in South Africa itself. It has become customary for these pledges to serve in the great majority of cases only as masks for hiding what is actually going on behind the scenes.111.	In a plural society—and my delegation is persuaded to assert that South Africa is in fact such a society  as indeed are many  if not all  of the States in the international community gathered here today—it is imperative that every section of that society  through its elected representatives  participate fully in government. Apartheid  by its nature  and its failure to acknowledge this principle represents the very negation of humanity and a denial of the democratic process.112.	It is not enough to have South Africa modify its policy on petty apartheid. This may appear to South Africa and its collaborators as a major concession on its part. My delegation cannot accept this. The least we ask of South Africa is that the pluralistic character of its society be proportionately reflected in its Government  as it is in every civilized nation in our world today.113.	South Africa must note that adjusting to the views of others  accepting and benefiting from their information and experience  requires a sensitivity and restraint which makes all the difference between what is civilized conduct and what is not.114.	The choice  as my delegation sees it  is a simple one. Mr. Vorster is left with the choice of either ensuring the survival of all minorities in South Africa by accepting the immediate and imperative process of democracy  or enduring the consequences of the bloodshed which will inevitably result from his stubborn determination to stick to the obdurate policy of apartheid. The Sierra Leone delegation hopes that Mr. Vorster will be persuaded to choose democracy because time is decidedly running out for him.115.	It is a disturbing fact that South Africa has acquired nuclear capability  in spite of its shameless denial that it has done so. Already the regime is steeped in the blood of innocent African schoolchildren  whose only crime  if crime it be  is to have dared to question the way they are taught and governed. With its acquisition of nuclear technology  South Africa's aims must be ominously clear to all of us. It is quite conceivable that  either through desperation or by a deliberate act of aggression  or a combination of both  it may embark on the dangerous adventurism of the total annihilation of all Africans from the African continent in order to preserve it for its so-called white civilization and against the ""spread of communism"" for which the principles of apartheid  we are told  have become Holy Scripture. The responsibility for this criminal intention is as much South Africa's as  indeed  it is of those who by their complicity  silence or indifference have encouraged it.116.	South Africa continues to occupy Namibia with a superciliousness that baffles even its most loyal collaborators. It has deployed and continues to maintain a large part of its armed forces in that territory in defiance of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and the International Court of Justice. In addition  and in total disregard of international public opinion  it decreed on 1 September last the annexation of Walvis Bay and with characteristic arrogance added that its annexation of the Bay  although without prejudice to the future status of Namibia  was not negotiable. How long can the international community tolerate this arrogant flaunting of power or remain indifferent to this illegality?117.	Sierra Leone  for its part  once again reaffirms its support for SWAPO. It reiterates that any settlement which excludes SWAPO as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia is unacceptable and should not be recognized or countenanced by the international community. We therefore call upon South Africa to comply with Security Council resolution 385 (1976) without further delay  for that is the only way to sanity.118.	With respect to the situation in Zimbabwe  the policy of the Government of Sierra Leone has been to support armed liberation struggles as long as peaceful attempts to resolve the constitutional problems remain unproductive and deadlocked. In spite of the fact that there have been several attempts to resolve the constitutional crisis peacefully  the illegal Smith regime has continued to intensify its repression of the indigenous people of Zimbabwe and has committed acts of aggression against neighbouring independent States  which are all Members of this Organization. It is against this background that the Sierra Leone delegation reaffirms its unflinching solidarity with the liberation movements in Zimbabwe  whose continued struggle may well be complemented by the most recent Anglo-American proposals for a settlement.119.	Commenting on these proposals  His Excellency Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone  had this to say:""The preoccupation of the Government of Sierra Leone to see the restoration of legality to the political process in Zimbabwe  has for long remained as primordial as has been our solidarity with the African liberation movements in that country.""One of the most enduring tenets of the conduct of our foreign policy is buttressed by our fundamental belief in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. This is why we do entertain considerable hopes about the possibilities of a peaceful settlement of the Zimbabwe problem  as contained in the new Anglo-American proposals for restoring legality in Zimbabwe.""120.	In this spirit  the delegation of Sierra Leone welcomes the practical measures contained in these proposals. In view of the failure of previous attempts  however  we call upon the United Kingdom and the United States of America to prevail on Ian Smith to accept the proposals  and to define in clearer terms  the role of the principal participants  so as to ensure the effective transfer of power to a majority government within a specific period and in an atmosphere of peace and security for all concerned.121.	We have never believed in the delusion to which Smith and his illegal white minority regime have given expression in claiming that an ""internal settlement"" can be possible within the foreseeable future. We warn him  as before  that time is decidedly running out and that this might be the last chance for him to accept with honour the inevitability of majority rule  and thus prevent the unnecessary loss of human life and property that will otherwise result from the armed struggle.122.	I wish to reaffirm before this world body that the Government of Sierra Leone is ready and willing to contribute its share to the United Nations Zimbabwe force as contemplated in the proposals. It is also our conviction that the Zimbabwe development fund  if generously subscribed to by the international community  could  along with the measures proposed for security  ensure a prosperous start for an independent State of Zimbabwe  which we are avidly looking forward to welcoming in this Assembly.123.	If the South African issue has been a matter of concern to us in Sierra Leone  the Middle East question  in our view  also rightly evokes concern. This Arab-Israeli conflict itself has had repercussions far and wide—if only manifested to some of us in this Assembly in phenomenal price increases in the cost of certain essential products.124.	The momentum generated by the disengagement agreements on the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights initiated and negotiated by the former United States Secretary of State  Mr. Henry Kissinger  was acclaimed universally as a step in the right direction. Those disengagement agreements marked the beginning of a genuine search for a durable peace. When those efforts culminated in the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  we entertained the hope that a real possibility existed for a lasting settlement. Unfortunately  the story of the Geneva Conference was that of an exercise in futility  and the thrust of the initial efforts became dissipated by procedural pedantry  ranging from the shape of the table to who should attend and in what capacity.125.	While we welcome the renewed peace initiatives  we are convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of November 1967  notwithstanding its studied ambiguity and omissions in certain particulars  provided to a large measure the point of departure for a viable peace settlement in the Middle East. While we acknowledge and reiterate the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries  in accordance with the spirit and letter of the said Security Council resolution 242(1967)  we remain resolved that the right of Israel to exist within those borders is as valid and as imperative as the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In other words  we affirm that the Palestinian people have a right to a secure homeland—indeed  to a State of their own—and we believe that the recognition  acceptance and application of that fact by the parties concerned in particular  and by the international community in general  would supply the missing but indispensable link in the chain of a durable and just settlement in the Middle East.126.	In this connexion  therefore  we regard the establishment of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and other areas of Israeli-occupied territory and the recently disclosed Sharon plan for further settlements in those areas to be not only patently illegal according to certain principles of international law but also a real impediment to the efforts now being undertaken to bring peace to that area. The plan for further settlements in the occupied territories are  we suspect  inspired by a kind of Jewish lebensraum  and it will  we are certain  inevitably evoke an Arabia irredenta response from the other side. This  unfortunately  is a recipe for perennial instability. The world cannot tolerate it.127.	We therefore call upon Israel to discontinue plans for the establishment of new settlements and to dismantle those already established.128.	Finally on this point  no fact in the history of the twentieth century is more staggeringly improbable than the State of Israel itself. Its establishment owes much to the finest ideals in man and much to his darkest barbarism. We therefore call upon Israel to recognize as a fact that thePalestinian people have a right to self-determination in a State of their own  as was envisaged and stipulated nearly 30 years ago by this Assembly in the partition plan resolution. We are convinced that it is only through the recognition and application of this fact that peace—a durable and just peace-will be restored to this part of the world.129.	The Cyprus situation continues to elude efforts towards a meaningful solution—a fact further complicated by the premature demise of President Makarios. The concerns of the Secretary-General as expressed in his report to this Assembly are therefore real. We shall support any solution which does not impair the independence and territorial integrity of that Republic and which assures the harmonious coexistence of the two communities without external interference. We therefore support the recent Security Council resolution which encourages the intercommunal dialogue and calls upon all concerned to exercise restraint.130.	When the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe convened in Helsinki in the summer of 1975  my country and  I believe  many others in this Assembly  expressed the hope that that event marked the beginning of a general period of stability. We took the optimistic view that military empires belong to the past  and that thenceforth science  technology and productivity would determine the ranks of individuals and nations  and we looked forward to sharing as beneficiaries of this great accord. In other words  detente meant  to us  a general lull in confrontation and a guarantee of our security  and  indeed  it created an atmosphere in which our economic well-being would be catered to. We entertained the hope  expressed by many speakers before me from this podium  that the enormous resources  both material and human  now devoted to armaments would be diverted to development. It is in this light that we support this same idea  as enunciated by the Foreign Minister of Sweden when she addressed this Assembly earlier  and we look forward to the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.131.	None the less  we have been disappointed in the fact that the events that have been unfolding in Africa since the Helsinki Conference bear all the marks of a shift of the theatre .of confrontation from the European continent. We cannot remain indifferent to the proxy wars being fought on the African continent. We therefore appeal to those Powers that have influence to take joint action with us to avert the disasters attendant on those confrontations. For us there is no substitute for peace.132.	The United Nations system represents a continuum in man's drive for co-operation and a search for peace on this one planet  earth. The Charter in 1945 realized  then as well as now  that for prosperity  as well as for peace and freedom  the world is one. The basis of the international economic system should be that poverty anywhere constitutes poverty everywhere for poverty like peace is indivisible. Articles 1 and 55 of the Charter of the United Nations commit the Organization to the solution of problems of an economic  social and humanitarian character. It cannot be otherwise  for neither peace nor freedom can resist disruptive forces if the economy fails to provide for the general welfare. Economic stability and the elimination of poverty have therefore occupied—rightly  in our view—a central place on the agenda of the United Nations.133.	Since the seventh special session of the General Assembly  the world community has embarked on a number of meetings and negotiating rounds the main objective of which has been to arrive at a modus operandi for the implementation of the definitive decisions adopted since the sixth special session. Those decisions we believe  complement the thrust of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade in so far as they are related to the universal endeavour to plan  on the basis of quantitative data  targets and projections  the growth and development of the least developed countries.134.	Unhappily  we have not on the whole succeeded in translating those decisions into reality. We have often ended up with different groups within our system maintaining uncompromising positions on all the crucial issues. Such a situation  we believe  not only is undesirable  but is likely to lead to that confrontation and sterility which we have laboured so much to avoid. It is our firm view that the developed market economies have not made the concessions which we expected of them  nor have they yet made the required rational and equitable adjustments of their consumption of the non-renewable resources of the world. The result of such an attitude has been the failure to finalize our negotiations on such key issues as the common fund for buffer stocks which  within the Integrated Programme for Commodities 3 we expect to be a key stabilizer of the earnings of developing countries.135.	Seven years after the launching of the Strategy for the Second Development Decade  the targets which were set to narrow the gap between the developed and developing countries have not been achieved. Only a few developed countries succeeded in meeting the target for the transfer of official development assistance in the form of grants and concession loans in accordance with the requirements of that Strategy.136.	The various negotiations on problems of the world's economy held with a view to bringing the new international economic order into being  produced equally unsatisfactory results. Among the efforts made in the past 12 months to achieve an equitable international economic order  my delegation believes that the Conference on International Economic Co-operation provided a useful and challenging forum for resolving the differences that exist between the developed and developing countries. To be sure  the Conference achieved only limited and meagre results on a number of crucial issues; but then one does not expect the new international economic order to emerge overnight. My delegation would like to see the discussions continued and sustained throughout this session of the General Assembly  so that some compromise and understanding will be achieved on the key issues which are still unresolved.137.	Speaking specifically of the International Development Strategy  we can say that its failure is due manifestly and mainly to the performance of the developed countries which have not  as a whole  attained the targets or implemented the policy measures contained therein. Furthermore  it is our view that the Strategy itself proved ineffectual in that it attempted to tackle the problems of economic development through a series of unrelated measures within an existing international institutional framework which had evolved a structure which gave a greater share of the benefits to the developed market economies.139. Those nations which are most powerful and whose interests are best served by the status quo have advocated stability far more than change. This was the case when the developing countries demanded"" a redistribution of the world's resources and called for a fuller participation in the decision-making process. In this regard  stability for the developed countries became conterminous with the ""continuance of their material prosperity."" But that very continuance of material prosperity happens to be the root-cause of instability in the world economy and  unless this fundamental contradiction is resolved  concepts like ""the new international economic order""  ""international co-operation"" and ""interdependence"" will merely continue to mask the political and economic self-interest of the more powerful. The extremely meagre achievements of the Paris talks  in our view  confirm this assessment.140.	Unfortunately  the failure of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation to resolve crucial issues continues to create considerable anxiety and concern among developing countries. Nevertheless  we in Sierra Leone believe that the Paris talks formed a basis for promoting understanding and have brought into full focus some of the underlying problems connected with development and international economic co-operation. We therefore took a keen interest not only in the proceedings of the Conference itself  but in all the subsequent international efforts deployed for the continuation of the dialogue within the forums and under the auspices of the United Nations. Sierra Leone's guiding principle here is to give each and every member of this community of independent and sovereign States an opportunity to participate and to be heard.141.	My delegation's concern for the impasse reached in the Paris talks transcends the much-talked-about understanding of contemporary economic relations which was thought to have been engendered. While acknowledging the limited results of the talks  therefore  Sierra Leone does understand and share the frustration of the South  to which we rightly belong  at the way the spirit of goodwill  so refreshingly manifested by all concerned during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  failed to translate that understanding into the vital agreements on crucial issues which the group of 19 developing countries represented at the Conference fought so hard to secure. The perpetuation of that goodwill suffered an even greater setback by the failure of the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly to come up with an agreed text for an objective assessment of the outcome of that Conference.142.	During that session  we noted a disquieting hardening of the positions of different groups  positions which are fodder to the lingering spectre of the very imbalances in economic power that dictated the need for the establishment of the new international economic order. It is my delegation's sincere hope that bringing such intricate negotiations within the competence and under the aegis of the United Nations system will not mean that they will suffer in the future from this trend.143.	We are convinced that related to the global search for a new international economic order are the endeavours embarked upon in Caracas in 1974s for rational and more intelligible ground rules for the exploitation and utilization of the sea  which represents three-quarters of mankind's living environment.144.	We therefore believe that the international community should proceed in its efforts to develop a body of rules-an institution  if you will-to regulate the use  exploration and exploitation of the sea. It is for us rather disappointing that the international community has so far not been able to complete the negotiations necessary for the adoption of a comprehensive regime for the law of the sea. We hope  however  that those areas on which a reasonable amount of agreement has been reached will be protected against further amendment which  if encouraged  will continue to move the Conference round in circles in a never-never world.145.	In spite of the many criticisms aired in recent times about our Organization  my delegation still has faith in the validity and viability of the United Nations. We believe that an institution of this nature  once established  acquires a life of its own  independent of the elements which have given birth to it  and it must develop  not necessarily in accordance with the views of those who created it  but in accordance with the requirements of contemporary  life.146.	In meeting the challenges attendant on this transition of the Organization from the way it was conceived in San Francisco in 1945 to the way it is adjusting to the demands of contemporary life  it is our view that the Secretariat has over the years discharged its functions with praiseworthy effectiveness  despite the meagre resources upon which ithas had to rely.147.	In this respect I should therefore like to pay my delegation's special tribute to our Secretary-General and the dedicated members of his staff  through whose untiring efforts the ideals and principles of the Charter still continue to keep us together in our joint venture to a better and prosperous works. "
"116",6288,"SLV",32,1977,"﻿284.	 I should like to associate myself and my Government with all those who at this rostrum have congratulated Mr. Mojsov on his election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. That Unanimous election constitutes not only a fitting tribute to his great qualities as statesman  jurist and diplomat but also a well-deserved recognition of his country  Yugoslavia  which has succeeded in preserving its independence with dignity in a world in which it is so difficult to escape the influence and domination of extremely powerful and frequently insuperable political and economic forces.285.	It is a pleasure for me to welcome the delegations of Djibouti and Viet Nam  new Members of the United Nations  and to wish them success in their mission and growing prosperity in their countries  which have been welcomed to this great family of nations.286.	The regular session of the General Assembly is particularly overburdened with work "" having an agenda which includes more than 125 items. It is true that among these there are  naturally  some which are more or less routine and many others which are not new but have  rather  come to us from previous sessions. These circumstances  however  in no way detract from the significance of the large number of items to be considered.287.	Every year the General Assembly studies numerous reports and various suggestions and proposals on subjects that have repeatedly been considered in previous years. This proves not only the complexity and importance of the subjects but also the great diversity in trends  aspirations  interests and opinions which divide men and peoples and characterize their complexity. Therefore we can in no way attribute to a deficiency in the Organization or to inefficacy on its part the fact that certain items remain for ever on the agenda of the Assembly.288.	Since this is the first time the new Government of El Salvador  which came into office just three months ago  has come before the General Assembly through my representation  I should like to refer  though not at great length  to some of the items we are most interested in or which affect us most closely among the many included on the agenda.289.	To the efforts to attain disarmament  denuclearization  the strengthening of international security  decolonization and so other noble objectives pursued in this Organization to benefit mankind  we should always add a constant persevering and indefatigable struggle to further the over-all development of peoples  to improve the lot of the neediest and to eradicate or reduce hunger  ignorance  crime  disease  unhappiness  pain and grief in all their manifestations. All nations-large and small  rich and poor  weak and powerful  developed and developing—must participate in that over-all struggle because it is of benefit to all to ensure the well-being of future generations everywhere in the world  and that can be attained only through general and balanced development which would eliminate the deep differences existing at present and make possible a truly human life for all and not just for a few. His Holiness Pope John XXIII rightly said that the development of peoples was the new name of peace.290.	My delegation regrets that  for reasons which we all know  when we resumed the work of the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly in mid-September to consider the items left pending last year  namely  development and international economic co-operation  and the implementation of the decisions adopted by the Assembly at its seventh special session-at which time the results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation recently concluded in Paris should have been analysed-it was not possible to achieve the desired consensus. Since new efforts in that regard will be undertaken at this session  we hope that this time the necessary consensus will be achieved.291.	It would be extremely discouraging if developing countries were ultimately to fail in their efforts to establish and consolidate a new international economic order. That would be tantamount to taking a step backwards from the position of the seventh special session  at which  fortunately  there was a frank spirit of conciliation between the industrialized nations and the developing world which opened up broad prospects for co-operation and understanding  thus keeping alive the hopes of more than two thirds of the population of the world. It is generally recognized that a new international economic order more equitable and just than the one that has prevailed heretofore will favour all those sectors equally.292.	In this connexion I wish to emphasize the importance of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their meeting on 29 September last here at United Nations Headquarters and to highlight  in particular  the concepts expressed by my colleague the Foreign Minister of Uruguay in his brilliant presentation at that time  when he spoke for the Latin American group of States.293.	El Salvador participated and will continue to participate very actively in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The work of the Conference on such important matters as the evolution and codification of this new field of law is of capital importance for the economic development of all the peoples of the world. The body to be established to exploit the sea-bed for the benefit of all must have the necessary powers duly to safeguard the interests of the international community. These and other aspects of the subject must be considered at the forthcoming meetings of the Conference in Geneva on the basis of the composite informal negotiating text  and it is to be expected that at that time we shall overcome the obstacles which have heretofore impeded conclusion of such an important instrument as that on the law of the sea. That instrument appears even more necessary when we consider that delay in signing and implementing it could give rise to unilateral action by maritime Powers which could be detrimental to the interests of other nations.294.	Scattered throughout the agenda of the present session there are items on two problems that are different but are nevertheless interrelated in certain respects. I refer to human rights and international terrorism.295.	My Government is a firm supporter of the exercise and protection of human rights  which are broadly guaranteed in our political Constitution.296.	In addition to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other United Nations documents on specific matters  two new instruments have come into force—the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.297.	Thus  notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter  which enshrines in the United Nations the principle of non-interference  the subject of human rights  while continuing to fall within the purview of the internal law of States  has been included in the field of international law. This is shown by the existence of declarations of rights  of the covenants I have just mentioned  and of the American Convention on Human Rights  signed in San Jose on 22 November 1969  which we hope will enter into force soon. States have freely committed themselves to promote  guarantee and respect human rights  and under international public law that commitment is not only of a moral nature; it is unquestionably legally binding.298.	Under the present United Nations system  as well as at the inter-American level  it is incumbent upon the various commissions on human rights to act in cases of violation of human rights. No State may or should bypass those commissions and itself investigate the situation with regard to human rights in another State. There is no doubt that that would be tantamount to intervention  and  although it might be done for humanitarian reasons  it would none the less be intolerable. Furthermore  that attitude .nay  obviously  be construed as unfriendly and therefore prejudicial to good relations between friendly countries.299.	El Salvador agrees with the idea that the United Nations should have a High Commissioner for Human Rights. That idea that has been under consideration since the French professor Rene Cassin  whose memory we praise  and several years ago suggested the creation of the post of Solicitor-General of the United Nations for Human Rights. No doubt the establishment of the post of High Commissioner would be a positive step in this regard.300.	My country has always been against all forms of discrimination and will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to eliminate the abnormal practices which still persist in some parts of the world and which are prejudicial to man's dignity and therefore a flagrant violation of human rights.301.	International terrorism  that terrible scourge which affects many peoples in the world  including peoples of Latin America  and which is spurred on by foreign governments  should be rejected and condemned by all; and it is of concern in the United Nations  since in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed the item for the consideration of this Assembly.302.	In recent years terrorist crimes have occurred frequently in El Salvador  especially kidnappings  extortion and the murder of important and progressive persons useful to the country.303.	My Government  aware of the difficulties encountered in the struggle against this type of common crime  terrorism  will be pleased to co-operate with any efforts which this General Assembly or other United Nations bodies may undertake in order  if not to eliminate  which seems impossible  at least to reduce acts of terrorism and their abhorrent consequences.304.	In the internal struggle against this evil of our times  Governments usually find themselves having to suspend constitutional guarantees in order to maintain public order and to safeguard the institutions of the State. The exercise of this power within reasonable limits cannot  and should not  be interpreted in the international field as being a violation of human rights  since the aim is rather to defend society and individual persons from the danger of terrorist criminals  whether active or potential.305.	The work of decolonization  which has been launched and developed successfully by this Organization for several years  remains among the main items in the agenda of the General Assembly. My delegation will support every initiative to favour the aspirations of peoples wishing to attain their independence  as also the aspirations of those who defend their territorial integrity  such as the cases of Guatemala and Argentina with regard to Belize and the Islas Malvinas  respectively.306.	With regard to Belize  El Salvador  which observed with extreme concern the tension which arose a few months ago in the Central American region  now views with satisfaction the talks between the Guatemalan and British Governments  which offer favourable prospects for a negotiated  settlement that will harmonize the aspirations of Guatemala with the interests of the people of Belize.307.	Latin American countries joyously welcome the results of the negotiations carried out for over 13 years between the Governments of Panama and the United States of America on the question of the Panama Canal. President Carter and his immediate predecessors have undoubtedly made laudable efforts to try to give reasonable and just satisfaction to the aspirations of the Panamanian people  which were advocated nobly by its Government. It only remains for the two treaties signed in Washington on 7 September last  which were to replace the original instrument signed in 1903  to enter into force  after the Panamanian people adopts them in a plebiscite and the United States Senate has consented to them as provided for in its Constitution.308.	The Government of El Salvador trusts that the conciliatory efforts made by the United Nations may in the near future  if not bring about a total elimination of the tensions due to the situations in the Middle East and in Cyprus  at least reduce them considerably and  in any case  prevent a worsening of the situation that might lead to new armed conflicts which could obviously endanger the peace and security of all nations.309.	The prospects for the convening of a conference on the question of the Middle East soon  and  above all  the attitude adopted by the Government of Israel in recent weeks  indicate that negotiations may lead to a positive result. A recognition of the existence of Israel by the Arab States  and the just fulfilment of the aspirations of the latter  and in particular of the ""Palestinian people  would certainly be the pillars of a lasting peace in that area.310.	With regard to Cyprus we also hope that conflicting interests may be reconciled  thus ensuring a peaceful life for all of the population of Cyprus.311.	It is frequently said that today's world is undergoing a period of transition; that the problems it faces are so serious and complex that it remains at the cross-roads; that this is the most critical  the crucial moment in its existence  and so on and so forth. This is repeated year after year from this rostrum and  therefore  we are used to hearing these words  and we almost do not realize that in fact something serious and irreparable could befall mankind. What is true is that events may occur which could lead to a better life for human beings inhabiting this planet  or which  on the contrary  could result in a world disaster or a series of cataclysms which would engulf us in desperation and suffering.312.	This Organization  the United Nations  has the virtue for the world of generating and strengthening the necessary hope and faith in God which is the only thing which can give us peace of mind. "
"117",6360,"SOM",32,1977,"﻿132.	At the outset of my statement I should like  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to express deep feelings of sympathy and condolences to the Government and the people of the Yemen Arab Republic on the sad occasion of the sudden and tragic deaths of Mr. Ibrahim Mohamed Al-Hamdi  the President of the Yemen Arab Republic  and his brother.133.	Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to convey to you the sincerest congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly My delegation is confident that your well-known qualities of wisdom and good judgment will enable you to preside successfully over our deliberations. In extending its congratulations to you. Sir  my delegation also expresses to you its assurance of full co-operation in the spirit of the policy of non-alignment to which both our Governments are committed. We wish you every success in fulfilling the tasks of your high office.134.	I should also like on this occasion to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  for his valuable efforts in the service of the United Nations during his presidency of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.135.	The untiring  efforts of Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for the promotion of peace and progress have rightly earned him the high esteem of the Member States. I wish to associate myself with the many speakers before me who have paid a tribute to the Secretary-General in appreciation of his work in the interest of humanity.136.	The corner-stone of my Government's foreign policy is its belief that neither regional nor international peace can be secured unless peoples under colonial or alien rule are granted the right to self-determination. It is on the basis of this belief that my Government has consistently supported the legitimate struggle of peoples to attain independence and to take charge of their own destinies. The consistency and determination with which we championed the cause of the people of Djibouti throughout its long struggle to be free from colonial rule is known to all. It is therefore with great satisfaction and joy that we extend a fraternal welcome to the Republic of Djibouti as it takes its rightful place in the community of nations. We are confident that the deep-rooted historical  ethnic and cultural ties which link our peoples will ensure continued goodwill and friendly co-operation between our two States.137.	The struggle of the Vietnamese people for freedom from foreign domination and for national unity was an epic one. We express our satisfaction at the accession to United Nations membership of the Republic of Viet Nam after an unnecessarily long delay  and we extend our good wishes for the future of its people.138.	The Middle East is an area where contempt for equal rights and the self-determination of peoples has led to a serious situation which poses an ever-present threat to International peace and security The usurpation of Arab lands by the Zionists through various means over the years can be seen today in the acceleration of the plan for the de facto annexation of yet another area of Arab territory—the West Bank.139.	My Government believes it is of the highest importance that the General Assembly condemn  without reservations and without a dissenting voice  Israel's attempt to change the demographic and political character of Arab territories through the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank  on the Golan Heights  in the Gaza Strip and in Sinai.140.	The Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East conflict. My Government wishes to reaffirm its continued support for the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. While we welcome the momentum towards the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East and the growing acceptance of the principles on which the Conference should be based  we do not believe that this should be an end in itself. There are basic and fundamental principles that must first be recognized if a peaceful  just and lasting settlement is to be achieved. We firmly believe that full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a reconvened Geneva Conference is essential for any meaningful progress towards peace.141.	The long preoccupation of the United Nations with the problems of southern Africa reflects the enduring relevance of the Charter's emphasis on the equal rights and the self-determination of peoples. Despite the large body of resolutions on southern Africa  this Organization remains ineffective in implementing its own decisions and in assuming its responsibilities under the Charter.142.	The lack of political will to pursue vigorously the application of internationally sanctioned principles encourages the racist minority regimes to persevere in their defiance and allows the traditional allies of racism to continue their collaboration with impunity.143.	In South' Africa  the economic co-operation and friendly relations of its trading partners have not helped in the fight against apartheid  nor brought stability. On the contrary  they have strengthened it. The murder of prominent political personalities and of schoolchildren  and the atrocities committed against the people continue unabated.144.	If the situation in South Africa was a potential threat to peace almost 20 years ago—as the Security Council concluded at that time—it is certainly a real threat to peace today145.	Having supplied South Africa not only with sophisticated weapons and their patents  but also with nuclear power  its trading partners now express surprise and alarm because the monster they created has the capacity to produce and test nuclear weapons.146.	If the United Nations action against South Africa is to have any meaning or effect  the international community  and in particular the powerful friends of the racist regime  should have the moral courage fully to assume their responsibilities under the Charter and to implement the decisions of the Organization.147.	The liberation of Zimbabwe is another source of deep concern to my Government. Unfortunately  the situation there has been allowed to drag on interminably over the years and to deteriorate to the point where it constitutes a distinct threat to peace and security in the region.148.	The reality of the situation is that no matter how much the Smith regime and its supporters twist and manoeuvre  majority rule will inevitably be established.149.	My Government fully supports all efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the problem in conformity with the principles of the Charter. Such efforts must not  however  be allowed to prolong the racist minority domination of Zimbabwe  nor should they compromise the aspirations of its people for genuine independence.150.	In conformity with our policy in the past  my Government will continue to support to the fullest extent possible the liberation forces of the people of Zimbabwe so long as the intransigence of the minority regime and the realities of the situation render armed struggle necessary.151.	With respect to Namibia  the illegal presence of South Africa in a Territory with international status and the racist domination of its people constitute aggression against Namibia.152.	In recent months we have been informed about initiatives that have been taken by certain States to bring about a settlement of the problem. In the view of my Government  the United Nations would renege on its responsibilities if it failed to obtain  inter alia: first  a resumption of United Nations responsibility for Namibia by the establishment of an interim United Nations administration of the Territory; secondly  the termination of South Africa's administration of the Territory before the interim administration is set up; thirdly  the complete withdrawal of South Africa's troops from Namibia before an exercise in self-determination is conducted; fourthly  the territorial integrity of Namibia  including Walvis Bay.153.	My Government hopes that there will not be a repetition of the sterile ultimatums  the successive periods of grace  and the vetoing of meaningful resolutions which have frustrated the will of the majority of Member States. We trust that South Africa's friends on the Security Council will give their powerful support to the only kind of pressure which the Vorster regime understands and which the situation merits: measures under Chapter VII of the Charter.154.	I shall briefly touch upon the international economic situation. The slow pace of efforts to establish a new world economic order constitutes yet another threat to world stability. My Government regrets that the Paris talks  the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  while achieving some progress  fell far short of reaching internationally established goals.155.	Our world today is characterized by ever-growing interaction and interdependence of which the rising expectations of the peoples of the poorer nations for a better life and the tremendous technological capabilities and productive capacities of the developed nations are the essential components. In this respect  while the developing countries themselves should exert maximum efforts for speedy development  it is necessary that the advanced nations agree to utilize their resources and technical know-how for others to develop in turn their own resources without exploitation.156.	Another matter which needs careful study and resolute action is the growing protectionism of the industrial States. This unfortunate development could well invalidate any progress made towards equalizing the conditions of world trade.157.	My delegation hopes that the more widely representative forum of the General Assembly will be able  during its present session  to come to grips with the issues which still present obstacles to the establishment of a just and equitable world economic order.158.	In this connexion  better terms of trade established through commodity prices and easier access to markets  the improved quality and increased flow of aid on concessional terms  easing of indebtedness and monetary facilities  sharing of technology and the accruing benefits  and a host of other equally important related issues constitute the necessary prerequisites for the attainment of the desired order.159.	There are many situations obtaining in the world today where peace has either been shattered or rendered precarious as a result of the denial of the right to self-determination. I have already mentioned the dangerous situation in southern Africa  where the rights of the people have been cruelly denied by colonial racists. I have also mentioned the case of the Palestinian people  whose homeland has been usurped by Zionist settlers.160.	Both situations have given rise to dangerous tension and to conflict and will continue to do so unless the rights of the people concerned are recognized and their aspirations given practical expression. The twentieth century has witnessed a decisive repudiation of outdated practices and justifications for territorial acquisition and the development of a new moral  political and legal ethic: the self- determination of peoples.161.	The development of international law on the question of self-determination  particularly through the decisions of the Security Council  the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice  as well as the various legal instruments agreed to by the United Nations  makes clear the principal points: first  that self-determination is a fundamental right in contemporary international law  and  secondly  that the right to self-determination is available to all peoples who are subjugated  that is  who are functionally subjected to colonialism.162.	My delegation considers it necessary to draw attention to these fundamental principles because disregard for them is the source of the tension currently obtaining in the Horn of Africa. The threat to peace in the region is the direct result of the denial of the right to self-determination and independence of the people living in the area. The struggles taking place in Ogaden  and in other areas within the Ethiopian empire are manifestations of the determination of the people to free themselves from colonial rule in exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination.163.	The western Somalia question is not of recent origin  as the Ethiopian Government attempts to portray it. Its genesis goes back to the late nineteenth century  at the time of the scramble for Africa. The international community has only recently become more aware of this problem through press reports on the wide-scale fighting taking place there. It is indeed a tragedy that in the past countless appeals for justice were left unheeded and international interest in the plight of the people of western Somalia had to be aroused only after much suffering and destruction. Unfortunately  there still exist some misconceptions on the origins of the problem  the objectives of the liberation struggle and the position of the Somali Government on this matter. I wish therefore to provide the Assembly with factual information on the question in the hope that it will then have a fuller understanding of the situation.164.	It is important to note that until the European Powers came to the Horn of Africa in the 1880s the Somali people enjoyed an independent existence and controlled their own affairs. The Ottoman Empire exercised nominal suzerainty over the coastal areas and over some inland centres such as Harar  while the rest of the Somali hinterland enjoyed total independence. The end of Ottoman suzerainty in 1884 saw the arrival of the British  the French and the Italians. In the period between 1884 and 1887 the three Powers were busy concluding protectorate treaties with Somali representatives.165.	At the time those agreements between the European and the Somali people were being negotiated  Emperor Menelik of Ethiopia took advantage of the situation and began an ambitious expansionist drive to extend the frontiers of the Empire. In this drive Ethiopia's territorial ambitions were facilitated by the collusion of the three European colonial Powers and by the cupidity of the European arms suppliers.166.	In the ensuing political and military scramble the frontiers of the Ethiopian empire were extended beyond all expectations. Harar  which had been an independent Somali State since time immemorial  fell to Menelik's forces in 1887. Its occupation enabled Menelik to send his hordes into Somali territory. In 1891 Menelik brazenly stated in a circular letter to the European Powers:""While tracing today the actual boundaries of my Empire  I shall endeavour  if God gives me life and strength  to re-establish the ancient frontiers of Ethiopia up to Khartoum and as far as Lake Nyanza  with all the Gallas.""Ethiopia has been for fourteen centuries a Christian island in a sea of pagans. If Powers at a distance come forward to partition Africa between them  I do not intend to be an indifferent spectator.""As the Almighty has protected Ethiopia up to this day  I have confidence he will continue to protect her and increase her borders in the future ...""In the light of the version of this circular letter given on 10 October in this very hall  I emphasize the word ""indifferent"".167.	Menelik successfully realized his ambitions for territorial aggrandizement through a series of pacts and agreements with other colonial Powers. These agreements were concluded without the knowledge and against the interests of the population concerned.168.	The Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897 was a typical example of the betrayal of the trust of the Somali people and the sacrifice of their interests and rights as part of a political bargain with Menelik. That treaty purported to transfer Somali territory to the Ethiopian empire. It was negotiated without consulting the people concerned  and its existence was not brought to their knowledge until 1934  when an Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission attempted to demarcate the boundary. The Somali people expressed indignation and outrage in widespread disturbances. In fact  until 1935 the Ethiopian presence on Somali territory had been confined to a few areas on the periphery of the Ogaden and sporadic military forays from those areas.169.	My delegation wishes to make it clear that Britain had no authority whatsoever to cede or in any way to traffic in the land of the Somali people. The treaties it concluded with the Somali people between 1884 and 1887 provided the only possible basis for whatever British authority may have exited with regard to those parts of Somali territory under British protection. The protectorate treaties were international agreements. If one seeks to separate the 1897 treaty from the prior protectorate treaties of 1884 to 1889  then the 1897 treaty falls  for lack of all authority.170.	As for the agreement purported to have been concluded between Ethiopia and Italy in 1896 establishing the boundaries of former Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia  it should be noted that there is no official version of the agreement in existence. But that is not important. More significant is the fact that  as in the case of the Anglo- Ethiopian Treaty  the Somali inhabitants were not consulted at any stage of the purported negotiations. In any case  the question of western Somalia is today not one of boundaries between Somalia and Ethiopia; it is a colonial question. That colonial situation is in the process of being terminated by the people concerned  with the Western Somali Liberation Front and their vanguard.171.	Ethiopia endeavours to mislead international  opinion by repeatedly claiming that until 1975 there had been no liberation movement western Somalia. This manoeuvre is not surprising  since throughout its occupation of the territory Ethiopia has resorted to every device to hide the facts. Until recently it was relatively successful in this regard because of the apathy and disinterest of the international community. Its ostrich-like attitude of denying the existence of the Western Somali Liberation Front is characteristic of all colonialists.172.	The liberation struggle that is being waged in western Somalia is by no means a new phenomenon. It began at the turn of this century when Sayed Mohamed Abdulla Hassan  a great Somali nationalist  rallied Somali forces in a war of liberation against Ethiopian  French  British and Italian colonialism. His struggle continued for 21 years  from 1899 to 1920. He was born in the Ogaden  and he died there. The liberation struggle he began has continued with varying degrees o/intensity until this day.173.	The Western Somali Liberation Front  which was established in 1943  has on behalf of the entire people taken upon itself the sacred trust of carrying on the struggle until total freedom is achieved. If Ethiopia pretends ignorance of the existence of the Western Somali Liberation Front  it is because Ethiopia is afraid to recognize and accept the realities.174.	Following the Italo-Ethiopian conflict in 1935  Italy occupied western Somalia and remained there until 1941  when it was driven out by British forces. When Emperor Haile Selassie was restored to power in 1942  Britain retained the administration of the Ogaden  recognizing that the area was a distinct entity separate from Ethiopia.175.	There was hope that the wrong which had been inflicted on the people would have been redressed and that they would be given their right to self-determination. In fact a proposal along these lines was made at the time. Regrettably  because of power politics and the prevailing insensibility to human aspirations  the wishes of the people of western Somalia were again ignored. They were betrayed  and in 1948 were once more compulsorily transferred to Ethiopian rule. This transfer was not without protest. Violent demonstrations took place throughout the region and there was active opposition to the imposition of Ethiopian rule. Repressive measures by the Ethiopian authorities included the public hanging of 15 prominent elders of the community as 3n act of intimidation.176.	The final act in the alienation of Somali territory came as late as 1954  when another portion of the Ogaden  officially known as the Reserved Areas  was handed over by Britain to the Ethiopians. This was again protested widely  though in vain  both by public demonstrations and by petitions to the United Nations and the British Government.177.	In the years that followed. Ethiopia war  able to maintain a military presence in the region. Through massive supplies of modern armaments it pursued at dispense of colonial policy. Through torture  arbitrary arrest  intimidation  the confiscation of properties and other inhuman methods  it endeavoured to farce the people’s submission. 178.	Over the past three years  ever since the present regime came to power  various humanitarian organizations have amassed a substantial body of evidence on human right violations in Ethiopia proper. The details of these violations have caused widespread horror and revulsion in the international community. Yet in terms of scale and intensity  those should not be compared to the atrocities that have been committed by the Ethiopian regime against the Somali population of the occupied territories. In whatever place the Ethiopians have set foot in Western Somalia they have left a trail of hate  and have unwittingly strengthened the resolve of the population to secure their freedom at any price.179.	Ethiopia continues to use every opportunity to exploit for its own purposes the principles of territorial integrity and the inviolability of frontiers. It would like the international community to ignore the fact that its political evolution is not that of a nation-State but that of an empire acquired through nefarious means.180.	In order to maintain and to keep that empire intact Ethiopia is trying to claim protection under principles which are inimical to the decolonization process. In other words  it is trying to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. Our Charter and the resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly enjoin respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples . The Charter sets out in paragraph 3 of its Article 1 as one of its objectives ""... encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all .. ."".181.	Ethiopia's position will continue to be in direct conflict with the provisions of the Charter if it refuses to allow the peoples under its colonial rule their right to self-determination. The United Nations must not allow itself to be misled simply because Ethiopia happens to be a black colonial empire and not a white European one.182.	Imagine what would have happened if the European colonial Powers had used the same arguments Ethiopia is advancing today and had succeeded! Very few countries would have been able to achieve their independence.183.	By political manipulation  Ethiopia continues to solicit legitimacy for the illegally acquired territories on the grounds that the boundaries of Ethiopia have the same legitimacy 3S others.155. Ethiopia is trying to convince the international community that  having ridden itself of an Emperor  the empire has automatically been transformed into a unitary State with all the rights and privileges of a State. It hopes by these means to incorporate the colonial territories and thereby pre-empt any demand for self-determination or any action which the international community may wish to make in this186.	My delegation wishes to make clear that it will not be deceived for these manoeuvres and that it v/ill actively support the people in western Somalia.187.	I hope that my intervention has provided the General Assembly with the necessary information enabling a clear understanding of the present situation in the Horn of Africa and of the historical developments that have led to that situation. The position of the Somali Democratic Republic is to seek a just and peaceful solution to the problem. In the past  we undertook several initiatives both at the bilateral level and through the OAU to achieve that end. Unfortunately  Ethiopia continues to be totally obsessed with its desire to hold on to its empire  and consequently has rejected any constructive proposal for a peaceful settlement.188.	In the wake of major victories that have been scored by the Western Somali Liberation Front  Ethiopia has been engaged in a plan to make Somalia a scapegoat for the failure of Ethiopia's colonial policies  and to this end has done everything to precipitate direct military conflict. A series of acts of aggression has been launched against my country by Ethiopia  with considerable loss of life and destruction of property. In spite of constant provocations  my Government continues to exercise maximum restraint. In the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government  held in Libreville in July of this year  and in other forums  we demonstrated that Somalia was not involved militarily in the present conflict. If aggression had been committed  it is Ethiopia which has transgressed against the people of western Somalia and continues to violate their rights.189.	These hostile acts on the part of Ethiopia  the severance of diplomatic relations and their refusal to acknowledge the existence of the Western Somali Liberation Front are a clear indication of Ethiopia's unwillingness to enter into meaningful negotiations and to come to grips with the political realities existing within its empire.190.	It is our belief that durable and lasting peace in the area can best be assured through a political solution that recognizes the right of the people of Western Somalia to self-determination. This can only be achieved if the parties to the conflict  namely  the Ethiopian authorities and the leaders of the Western Somali Liberation Front  are prepared to enter into direct negotiation. Somalia  for its part  »s prepared to offer its good offices to facilitate the holding of such negotiations.191.	There is one final point I wish to make: the conflict that is taking place in western Somalia is a war of liberation. Any interference by foreign Powers will exacerbate that situation and widen the area of conflict. "
"118",6397,"STP",32,1977,"﻿171.	 Once again we are afforded an opportunity to express the views of our Government before this Assembly of the United Nations.172.	This is an appropriate time to pay a deserved tribute to those who have more directly contributed  untiringly and with dedication  to the realization of the noble objectives of our Organization.173.	In fact  the struggle for peace  for justice  for security  for the exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples and for the development of international relations based on the principle of the equality of sovereign rights of nations  large and small  gives this Organization a universal dimension. That struggle also prompts the peoples of the world to place in the United Nations their hopes for the building of a better world for the whole of mankind.174.	In this context  we cannot therefore fail to express our profound satisfaction at the fact that the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly is held by a distinguished personality whose actions in support of the realization of the objectives of the United Nations Charter are well known and highly appreciated by all its Members.175.	The commitment of his country  Yugoslavia  side by side with peoples and nations aspiring to a world not divided into military blocs  is one of the pillars of the movement of non-aligned countries  and it undoubtedly plays a preponderant role in the area of detente in international relations.176.	The choice of Belgrade for the continuation of the Conference on Co-operation and Security in Europe is added proof of the positive role played by his country in the consolidation of relations between peoples. My delegation therefore pays him a sincere tribute  and is gratified to see him presiding over this session of the General Assembly.177.	May we also express our appreciation to Mr. Amerasinghe  the outgoing President  for the zeal and dedication that he showed throughout the last session.178.	We are convinced of the success of the work of the current session because we know that the President we have elected will find in the person of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  a collaborator who has given practical proof of his effectiveness and his dedication to the task of realizing the objectives of our Charter  in the form of efforts which are widely recognized. The work accomplished during his first term of office has made it possible to judge his merits and to entrust to him once again this high responsibility. On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  we reaffirm our confidence in him and in his exercise of the high functions entrusted to him and we wish him every success during his second term.179.	The presence of two new Members  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  has brought added strength to our Organization and has contributed to bringing it closer to universality and to giving it the character of a champion of just causes  which is in fact its vocation. We welcome most warmly the delegations of those two new Members and we reiterate our firm intention to strengthen our ties of friendship and co-operation  forged long ago during the hard days of our struggle for the right to be free and independent nations. The presence of a united Viet Nam symbolizes the efforts of that heroic people in its long and arduous struggle waged for the realization of the just and noble objectives of independence and national unification.180.	The people and Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe have followed carefully the countless efforts undertaken by the United Nations to endow mankind with a political and economic international framework in which the feelings of solidarity and justice and the combined efforts of all nations and countries aimed at a solution of problems capable of bringing man a better world and a better life should be the alternative to the policy of the strongest.181.	We acknowledge that the United Nations has already played a preponderant role in the solution of some problems affecting the world community  such as averting the risk of a generalized war  the consequences of which could well endanger the very existence of man on our planet. Its role was no less important in the realm of decolonization by reason of the support that our Organization gave to peoples struggling for their freedom. However  we must recognize that there is a yawning gulf between the realization of the objectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the results achieved to date.182.	The victories won in these past years by oppressed peoples are undeniable. Those victories are the fruits of the efforts of such peoples combined with the democratic and progressive forces of countries and the political and humanitarian institutions which understand and act to fulfil the aspirations of all men to live a life of justice.183.	The affirmation by our Organization of the rights of peoples to self-determination  and the efforts aimed at the progressive implementation of those rights and duties  the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration and Programme of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order are important steps towards the liberation of peoples and the creation of conditions conducive to ensuring the progress of all countries.184.	However  there still exist  both in Africa and in other regions of the earth  situations of flagrant injustice which are a permanent affront to the objectives pursued by the United Nations.185.	I shall begin by speaking more particularly of the situation in southern Africa  which is to date the most flagrant example of oppression and injustice. The statements by the representatives of the Member States at the two international conferences held in Maputo and Lagos respectively  like the statements by delegations that have spoken at this Assembly  reflect the unanimous condemnation of our international community of these hateful regimes based on racism and apartheid in Rhodesia and South Africa.186.	The two aforementioned international conferences -Maputo and Lagos-which were organized respectively in support of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe and against apartheid in South Africa  helped to enlighten world public opinion about the situation prevailing in the southern part of the African continent.187.	We are gratified to note this human solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa fighting to conquer their just and inalienable rights but we hope that concrete action can be taken to put an end to this unjust and oppressive situation. We reiterate here the appeal formulated in this regard during the Conferences of Maputo and Lagos.188.	That expression of solidarity should be translated into support for and specific implementation of the measures advocated in the Maputo and Lagos Declarations  so long as the rebels and racists of southern Africa persist in maintaining their systems of exploitation and domination of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.189.	We profoundly regret the death of yet another South African patriot  Steven Biko  who  having chosen the path of non-violence as a means of ensuring respect for the sacred rights of the people of South Africa to a free life without racial discrimination  was nevertheless the victim of the barbarous repression unleashed and pursued by the racists who have institutionalized violence. It is worth recalling on this occasion that thousands of patriots crowd the South African prisons  where they are tortured and murdered with impunity. Despite racist oppression in South Africa and the fact that the Sharpeville and Soweto petitions were put down with violence  they will go down in history as a torch of freedom which little by little will reach the whole of South Africa and will stop only when the injustices and exploitation committed by the South African regime disappear.190.	The Maputo and Lagos Declarations draw attention to the danger posed to world peace by the situation in southern Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa  which hinders the development of harmonious relations between the States comprising the United Nations. For this reason it is important that our actions should not be confined to mere verbal declarations condemning apartheid. Rather we should combine our efforts in order that specific measures may be taken to put an end to the illegal regime instituted by Ian Smith and his followers in Southern Rhodesia and to the system of apartheid and colonial domination of which the peoples of South Africa and Namibia are the victims.191.	Therefore it is essential that the States Members of our Organization apply rigorously the resolutions that have been adopted and that they do not supply any more weapons and other military equipment to the minority racist regimes in southern Africa.192.	In addition  the sanctions already adopted by the international community should be implemented rigorously against those oppressive regimes. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  immediately after the proclamation of its independence  took the necessary measures to prohibit South African aircraft from flying over or landing on our territory  as they were allowed to .do during the colonial regime:193.	It is in this context that we regret that  despite the United Nations resolutions and those of other bodies which love peace and freedom  certain Member States of our Organization continue to supply weapons—sometimes the most modern weapons-to the minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.194.	While we recognize that the legislation of each country may have more or less liberal aspects as regards the activities of its enterprises  we fail to understand that Member States should co-operate with the racist regimes to the extent of allowing some of their enterprises to operate in South Africa and to provide that country with the material  technical and scientific means for the manufacture of nuclear bombs.195.	It is undeniable that such a situation is a flagrant threat to the security of the African continent and endangers world peace and the development of friendly relations among States.196.	Our Government is following with keen interest the demarches undertaken just recently by the United Kingdom and the United States with a view to speeding up the decolonization of Southern Rhodesia. However  we hope that their actions will be guided by the principle of respect for the legitimate and just aspirations of a free and independent Zimbabwe  enjoying all the sovereign rights for which its people is fighting under the leadership of the Patriotic Front.197.	Namibia must accede to independence and its people must be able to exercise its sovereign rights to the full. Its territorial integrity must be respected  and that is why we condemn the steps taken by South Africa designed to separate from independent Namibia the territory of Walvis Bay  which is an integral part of that country.198.	The situation in the Middle East is a constant source of concern to us because  to date  the Palestinian people has been kept out of the land of its birth. On the other hand  part of the Arab territories is still under Israeli domination. It is obvious that neither peace nor stability can be established in the region as long as such an unjust situation persists. The Palestine Liberation Organization  which symbolizes the courageous struggle of that people to realize its aspirations to a free and sovereign homeland  can under no circumstances be dissociated from negotiations aimed at resolving the grave situation in the Middle East. It is with satisfaction that we follow the many demarches made by the Secretary-General of our Organization as well as those made by some Member States in order to bring the conflicting parties to the negotiating table. We believe  however  that it will not be possible to restore peace in the Middle East until the right of the Palestinian people to return to its homeland and to constitute a free  independent and sovereign State is clearly recognized. Israel must withdraw from all the Arab territories forcibly occupied since 1967. The efforts of the Arab countries in the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution of that problem and their will to achieve it are known to all. However  we note that Israel's attitude  threatening the sovereignty and integrity of Lebanon  refusing to accept participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in negotiations  and  finally  establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories  constitutes a major obstacle on the road to peace.199.	The presence of Viet Nam in the United Nations brings an added ray of hope to all peoples struggling for the achievement of their unity.200.	We hope that the Korean people  after long years of struggle to achieve its national unity  will soon see its ideal of peaceful reunification realized. We hope also that all foreign military forces will be withdrawn from its territory in order that the conditions may be created which will enable the people to attain peacefully and through negotiation its aspirations to unity.201.	The separation of the island of Mayotte  an integral part of the Republic of the Comoros  constitutes a violation of the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of Member States. That act serves merely to engender mistrust in relations between States  especially between the large and the small States. The island of Mayotte is part of the territory of the Comoros and was separated from it through dilatory tactics. That practice runs counter to the objectives of the OAU  which is struggling for the complete decolonization of our continent  and it is also in contradiction with the principles of the United Nations. This Organization  therefore  should take all the necessary measures to support the Comoros in its just claims and its aspirations to territorial integrity and national unity.202.	With respect to the problem of Cyprus  my Government hopes that the United Nations will continue all the necessary efforts to promote negotiations between the two communities in order to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Cypriot people to territorial integrity and national unity.203.	East Timor and Western Sahara continue to be unjustly occupied by foreign forces which seek to deprive the two peoples of their right to self-determination. TheUnited Nations must take all the necessary measures to enable the peoples of East Timor and Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. The forces which symbolize the struggle of those two peoples  FRETILIN and the Frente POLISARIO respectively  should be supported in their just struggle aimed at the realization of the legitimate rights of those peoples.204.	It is with great joy that we have taken note of the conclusion of the agreements between Panama and the United States on the Panama Canal situation. The settlement of that dispute between the two parties by peaceful means-and through fruitful negotiations is undoubtedly an important step forward towards the solution of international disputes and the recognition of the legitimate rights of peoples. We hope that the results arrived at by those two countries may serve as an example for the settlement of similar conflicts affecting relations between States.205.	As regards international economic relations  no one will question the need for trade in goods and services between the nations and States making up our international community.206.	We therefore believe that commercial  financial  technical and technological exchanges in different fields are forms of useful co-operation of interest to the international community and essential factors for progress.207.	However  what we call into question are the framework and the rules governing these international economic relations  which allow some to enjoy great advantages whereas for others the exchange of goods and services at the world level are so many factors giving rise to poverty for the masses of the population  economic stagnation and the perpetuation of economic under-development.208.	It is true that those relations were forged at a time when the peoples of countries that today benefit little or not at all from international economic relations were not able to defend their legitimate economic interests.209.	In a constructive spirit  we would say that it is not necessary to proceed to a historical investigation which would enable us to highlight the interests  forces and concerns that served as the basis for those relations that were established at a time when force was the preponderant element in the law governing international relations.210.	We are gratified to note that almost all the Members of our Organization  including those which are better able to create conditions for the rapid implementation of a new international economic order  have come out in its favour. That gives us reason to hope  but although we do not deny that the North-South dialogue produced some positive results  we cannot fail to emphasize that those results are in no way capable of freeing the economies of the developing countries from the deadlock in which they find themselves.211.	We regard as highly positive the conclusion that the debates and the negotiations for the establishment  of a new international economic order would be more productive if they were held in a framework in which all States could participate on democratic bases.212.	Economic relations and the general rules which should govern international trade  in particular in the field of primary commodities  trade in manufactures  the supply of energy in conditions offering guarantees of security to all  the transfer of techniques and technology  co-operation in the field of communications and the financial and monetary sectors  and  especially  the establishment of more suitable methods of payment and the maintenance of resources in the countries of origin—all these are problems to which a satisfactory solution cannot be found if they are confined within the limits of North-South relations.213.	In fact  it is necessary to create a new framework for international economic relations based on the principles of justice  efficiency and equality and on the recognition of the fact that in economic relations between States there are situations where one side or the other is at a disadvantage. That could serve as a basis for the creation of a framework for development and growth at the international level likely to eliminate  inter alia  poverty and insecurity on earth.214.	Thus we support the idea of convening a special session of the General Assembly in order to consider all questions relating to conditions of development at the international level  while taking the particular circumstances of individual countries into account  with a view to the establishment of a new international economic order acceptable to all.215.	On 12 July this year the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe commemorated the second anniversary of its independence. During those two years of free and independent life  all our efforts have been directed  on the one hand  towards giving our population the political  economic  social  cultural and material foundation and system that will enable all our citizens to enjoy a life of dignity. In this context constructive work is being done to enable our people democratically to elect and to depose its representatives in our political institutions both at the regional and central levels. First of all  elections were held for a constituent Assembly with the participation of the entire population  democratically and on the basis of universal suffrage. That Constituent Assembly drafted and adopted the first political Constitution of our country  which laid down the principles for the functioning of our State and 'the rights and duties of its citizens  as well as the means and mechanisms which should be placed at their disposal to allow them to fulfil their duties towards their homeland and towards the international and the national communities.216.	Furthermore  a National People's Assembly was established in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution. That People's Assembly  which comprises representatives from all the localities of our country  was elected democratically and is the sovereign power in our State.217.	Our struggle to eliminate under-development continues. It is manifest in the actions we have undertaken to increase the strength and capacity of our country by intensifying economic activity and mobilizing our population in women's  workers'  children's and youth groups for purposes of development and  hence  for its welfare.218.	Although we do not deny that international problems both of a political and an economic type have rather marked effects on our life  we rely above all for our national reconstruction on the work of our people and the sacrifices which it is ready to make to eliminate poverty  malnutrition  and economic stagnation inherited from the colonial regime.219.	To achieve these objectives  important internal changes and new international economic relations are needed. For that reason  when we tackled questions relating to present international economic relations  we expressed the hope that they would evolve towards the establishment of a new international economic order.220.	Indeed  fluctuations in the price of agricultural raw materials have repercussions on the value of the agricultural products of our country  which are the basis of our economy. Those repercussions are of great importance for the work and the very livelihood of our people.221.	During the two years of our independence our domestic efforts have been oriented towards the improvement of our productive machinery and the creation of better social and cultural conditions.222.	In the cultural and social spheres  our activity during those two years has been geared towards increasing the school enrolment of our population at every level and towards an intensive campaign to increase adult literacy.223.	We do not regard our work in the field of literacy and education as a simple matter of teaching people to read and write but  rather  as a way of enabling them to participate more and more intensively in the process of the material and spiritual transformation of their life.224.	Given the high infant mortality and the short life-expectancy of the population during the colonial period  my Government has been given special attention since independence to the improvement of health conditions and  in particular  to mother and child protection.225.	In the economic field  agriculture was selected as a priority factor for our development. For this reason  land and tax reform are under way essentially in order to increase the production of food  which our population lacks.226.	These reforms are also aimed at enhancing our country's export capacity through the treatment of plants  and the introduction of new agricultural techniques and new crops. We also recognize that in this sector our difficulties are enormous because the means available to us are insufficient to cover the intrinsic costs of such changes.227.	However  we are aware of the dynamism of our people and its will to agree to the necessary sacrifices in order to do away with our present poverty. We are also aware of the solidarity of the international community  whose effects are felt through the understanding and assistance that some members of our community have given us in order to help us to face some of our more immediate difficulties in these first years of our independence. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those countries that-have given us their support and assistance.228.	We are convinced that the support of the international community and of friendly countries is important because the problems we are struggling with are varied and in many cases exceed our material and human capacity  in particular in the agricultural  communications and telecommunications sectors.229.	We would not wish to conclude this statement without mentioning the question of armaments and military disarmament  which represent one of the fundamental preoccupations of the international community.230.	The importance of this question undoubtedly derives from the effects and repercussions that armaments and disarmament have on the relations between States on our planet  at both the political and economic level. In fact  actions aimed at the acquisition of weapons can only be an expression of the will for domination  political or economic  which rouses a defensive reaction on the part of other States  which then feel the need to arm themselves to ensure respect for the just aspirations of their peoples.231.	The holding of military arsenals dates from a period when international relations were essentially based on force  to the detriment of the legitimate rights of all peoples and countries  and we must therefore give pride of place to the problem of disarmament at this time  when peoples and nations are joining to establish a new political and international economic framework based on respect for the principles of justice  equality  peace and solidarity.232.	The disarmament question is  therefore  linked to international detente and to the implementation of resolutions already adopted concerning the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence  and the practical implementation of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the declarations of principle relating to the establishment of a new international economic order and to the non-use of the threat or use of force in international relations.233.	It is inconceivable that  while the greater part of mankind lives in abject poverty deprived of the minimum necessary for existence  enormous sums amounting to S300 billion a year are used to create the means of man's destruction.234.	We hope that the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament will mark a decisive stage for the future of mankind.235.	We have examined the most important problems and those with the most direct effects on the development of relations of co-operation and friendship among the peoples and States composing our world.236.	Some of those problems  such as those questions relating to southern Africa  the Middle East and other colonial situations  urgently require just solutions.237.	Others  equally important  are more complex and  for this reason  their solution requires that persevering efforts must be made both within each country and in the relations between States.238.	We hope  therefore  that the two future international conferences on disarmament and on the question of the establishment of a new international economic order will help to create new relations between men in which the spirit of co-operation and solidarity at the international level will be the alternative to the rule of the mighty and of those who possess military arsenals  especially nuclear arsenals  that are daily becoming more sophisticated and destructive."
"119",6429,"SUR",32,1977,"﻿ 1. Due to circumstances of national importance  the Prime Minister and Minister for General and Foreign Affairs  Mr. Henck Arron  has been prevented from personally attending this session of the General Assembly. On his behalf  however  and on behalf of my delegation  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over this session. Your election is not only a personal tribute  in view of your excellent record in the thorny field of international affairs  but it also reflects the high esteem in which your country is held by developing as well as developed nations. The outstanding role played by your country  Sir  and certainly by your President  Josip Broz Tito  in charting the course of the third world is and will always be a shining example for all of us.I should also like to express our deep appreciation for the work of the outgoing President  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  one of the senior statesmen in our midst who  with his lucid and profound understanding of international affairs  excelled once again in guiding the debates of the last session of the General Assembly.3.	I also extend the praise of my delegation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose relentless efforts and initiatives have contributed so much to increase the viability and international prestige of the United Nations.4.	My delegation wishes to convey its deeply felt sympathy and condolences to the people and the Government of Yemen on the tragic death of Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Mohamed Al-Hamdi  President of the Supreme Command Council and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Yemen Arab Republic.5.	I have already  in another capacity  welcomed the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations family. As the representative ofSurinam  however  I wish to state once again our deep conviction that the admission of these nations to membership in the United Nations will further the cause of peace and strengthen the universal role of the United Nations.6.	The Republic of Surinam is committed to the principles on which the United Nations was founded  and we see the world Organization as the main hope for mankind to achieve international peace  the protection of human rights and dignity and the furthering of the material well-being of all men  regardless of race  religion or political ideologies or governmental structures.7.	It nevertheless remains a fact of life that the results of the work of an organization  whatever its individual nature  depend on the manner in which it endeavours to realize its goals. It is a matter of growing concern—and I think that in this respect I am speaking for many of us—that the actual operations of the United Nations  and of its subsidiary and affiliated bodies  whose activities  admittedly  have become much more complicated since their inception  do not adequately meet today's requirements. The proliferation of committees and subcommittees  the adoption of a multiplicity of resolutions  the repetitions of statements made in general debates in subsequent conferences on the same subject and the consequent abridgement of the time left for meaningful negotiations  the initiating of over-ambitious programmes—all these are facts well-known to all of us.8.	The consequences of these phenomena are particularly felt by smaller developing countries like my own that are faced with the difficult task of taking part in relevant actions and of complying with the resolutions and decisions adopted by the United Nations and the aforementioned institutions. In many cases  high costs and a lack of manpower make participation in relevant conferences or meetings of committees and subcommittees almost prohibitive.9.	The adoption of over-zealous programmes and the establishment of an ever-growing number of committees and subcommittees—which are  ironically  often initiated or endorsed by developing nations—are aggravating the already heavy burden on the smaller Member nations. Furthermore  the adoption of a series of resolutions often involving the same subject matter  which such nations find it increasingly difficult to implement  could eventually  in case of non-compliance  seriously damage the prestige and credibility of those nations and that of the United Nations and its subsidiaries and affiliated organs.10.	The recent turn of events in the dispute between Panama and the United States over the Panama Canal  which resulted in the signing of the treaties between the two countries  indeed augurs well for future inter-American relations. On the occasion of the signing of those treaties the Government of the Republic of Surinam issued the following statement:""The Government of the Republic of Surinam expresses its satisfaction at the fact that an agreement concerning the Panama Canal has been reached between the Governments of the Republic of Panama and the United States of America. The Government of the Republic of Surinam has repeatedly called for the conclusion of a new arrangement concerning the Panama Canal that safeguards the sovereign rights of the people of Panama  and now congratulates the Governments of the Republic of Panama and the United States of America upon the successful outcome of their negotiations on this matter.""The agreement contained in the treaties to be signed by the two Governments involved constitutes a fact of historic significance. It will have an important influence on the development of relations between the American States  while at the same time setting an example to the world with regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.""My delegation expresses its hope that these treaties will enter into force as soon as possible.11.	The recent decision of the Government of Israel regarding the establishment of settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war and the statement of the Israeli Minister of Agriculture that Israel is planning to settle about 2 million Israelis in a so-called security belt over the next 20 years  as well as its move to extend social services to Arab inhabitants of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip  are certainly not encouraging for a peaceful solution of the Middle East conflict.12.	In view of the explosive situation  we do hope-that the ongoing consultations will enable the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East before the end of this year. The Surinam Government holds that any solution of the conflict should meet the following basic requirements: first  recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a State within agreed and secured boundaries; secondly  recognition of the right of the Palestinians to their own homeland; and thirdly  the withdrawal of all Israeli occupying forces from the territories captured in the 1967 war.13.	My delegation has in the past on several occasions expressed its hope for a peaceful solution of the conflict in the Korean peninsula. We are convinced that the efforts to reach a peaceful settlement will not be furthered by fruitless debates in the General Assembly and we are  therefore  very pleased that this question will not be dealt with during this Assembly. The Korean question  however  still contains all the elements for a serious threat to the maintenance of peace and security  not only in the area but indeed in the whole world. We would  consequently  welcome the resumption of the now suspended direct negotiations between South and North Korea  which could eventually lead to a peaceful reunification of Korea. Pending the fulfilment of that goal  my Government will support any proposal aimed at the admission of the Republic of South Korea and the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea to membership in our world Organization.14.	The Government of Surinam is deeply concerned about the situation in southern Africa. Peace in that region cannot prevail as long as the majority of the people in Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa are deprived of their legitimate and fundamental rights. As long as the white minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa resort to a policy of apartheid in defiance of universal condemnation  we can only expect turmoil and war in that area.15.	The situation in Rhodesia has worsened since the break-down of the constitutional talks in November 1976. Though the prospects for a solution along the lines of the recent Anglo-American plan are  admittedly  rather dim  we still hope that it may prove to be a basis for realistic negotiations.16.	With regard to Namibia  my Government firmly believes that no real solution of this problem can be found without the agreement of the South West African People's Organization which plays a foremost role in the struggle for the liberation of the Namibian people.17.	The proposals of the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference  in which SWAPO was not even represented and which is based on the system of tribal homelands and so-called white areas  cannot solve the problem. A conditio sine qua non for a peaceful solution is the immediate withdrawal of the South African armed forces from the Territory and the subsequent holding of general elections under the auspices of the United Nations.18.	In the meantime  my delegation is following with keen interest the ongoing consultations of the Western members of the Security Council with the South African Government on this matter. It goes without saying that my delegation would welcome any progress resulting from those consultations.19.	The continuation of the uprising of the non-white population in South Africa is a clear sign that the decaying process of the apartheid policy has started and that it will undoubtedly accelerate in the future.20.	The fact that the South African authorities reacted by intensifying their oppressive actions reminds us of the old saying that those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad. The only question now is  how can we  as States Members of the world Organization sharing a special responsibility towards the persecuted South African population  strengthen and shorten their struggle for human dignity and equality?21.	We all  of course  bear some of the responsibility  but the main burden rests squarely on those who  by maintaining economic links with South Africa  enable the South African Government to increase the means to continue and even intensify its racist policy. We agree with those who have always maintained that a stronger South African economy strengthens the Government of South Africa and not the victims of apartheid. Ii is imperative  therefore  that we isolate South Africa economically and politically from the world community until the struggle of its oppressed people has finally come to a successful end.22.	While the apartheid policy rightly deserves our most severe condemnation  being a blatant form of institutionalized racial discrimination  we are  however  painfully aware that racism is not confined to the Republic of South Africa. Throughout history  mankind has been plagued by the vicious sin of racism  the ugly consequences of which are  if possible  even more devastating than those caused by religious or ideological fanaticism. One is  indeed  inclined to conclude that the cancer of racism is even more terminal and dangerous than religious or ideological antagonisms  inasmuch as racism is perhaps an easier tool for power- thirsty politicians to use in inflaming the passions of innocent or naive people.23.	It is the considered opinion of the delegation of Surinam that the United Nations family  and in particular those organs charged with the investigation of discriminatory policies and actions  should closely watch racist actions wherever they may occur. It would indeed be very saddening for the moral values that we profess to uphold if we were to concentrate selectively on racial crimes perpetrated in certain specific areas while turning a blind eye to similar despicable and criminal acts in other countries.24.	I should like to underline once again the firm conviction of my Government that the unabated arms race not only menaces international peace and security  but should also be regarded as a regrettable waste of time  energy and resources in a world where poverty and hunger are still prevalent.25.	My Government has not only ratified the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America-the Treaty of Tlatelolco-and the Additional Protocol II relating to it  but will support all proposals aimed at the establishment of other denuclearized zones in the world.26.	It goes without saying that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  however useful they may be  is not an end in itself but only a step in the direction that my Government considers to be the only right one for the survival of mankind. The forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on disarmament is another step towards that goal  but it has to be made clear that the success of that special session will depend largely on the adoption of binding measures that will bring the arms race under effective international control.27.	The energy and the financial resources freed as a result of a slow-down in the arms race can be used very fruitfully for the implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.28.	As regards human rights  my Government notes with satisfaction that the Human Rights Committee started its work in March of this year by examining reports of States on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. My Government has ratified both the Covenant  its Optional Protocol  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore  Surinam has participated actively in the seminar on human rights and their promotion in the Caribbean area that was organized by the International Commission of Jurists and the Organization of Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Associations.29.	We regret that no satisfactory agreement could be reached at the final meetings of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly between the developed and the developing countries on the assessment of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.30.	Global economic growth and expanding populations have placed severe strains on the political institutions that were created after the Second World War and contributed so greatly to growth and progress. Output per person in the developing countries has doubled in both the agricultural and industrial sectors. However  many of those involved in the problems of the developing countries are still dissatisfied with their past performance and gloomy about the future. Their concern centres on the question as to why the indisputable relative growth and development has not resulted in a tangible rise in the living standards of their peoples. It is therefore encouraging to note that there is in the making an intensive rethinking of new development strategies that could be effective in alleviating poverty in the developing countries.31.	In the most seriously affected countries  the growth in food production continued to be disturbingly slow  and resulted in a decline in their per capita food production. We therefore support the resolution adopted recently by the Economic and Social Council in Geneva to convene a pledging conference in 1978 to support the World Food Programme's activities in 1979 and 1980.32.	The economic pattern of the developing countries  which  as we know  are mainly dependent on the production and export of primary goods and raw materials  is responsible to a great extent for their disadvantageous position in the world economy. The restructuring of the world economic order  by consolidating the position of countries producing raw materials and primary goods  was the main subject of the fourth session of UNCTAD  held in Nairobi last year. The Nairobi session indeed took a major step forward in the field of international economic policy by endorsing the concept of an Integrated Programme for Commodities and by establishing an extensive framework of negotiations with regard to the problem of commodities. We are pleased to note that the negotiations are taking place  not on an isolated  fragmented or piecemeal basis as was the case in the past  but as part of a single exercise  subject to a well-defined time frame.33.	The negotiations that took place in Geneva last March on a common fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities proved  however  to be inconclusive. Some of the major developed countries  which expressed reservations about the concept of the fund  have since indicated new and more positive approaches and attitudes. It is of the utmost importance that an agreement be achieved regarding the set-up and objectives of the common fund.34.	Issues such as whether the fund should be the central source for financing stocking arrangements and other measures under the Integrated Programme or whether it should be only one among many means for achieving the objectives of the Integrated Programme must be agreed upon. There is also the question of the financing of the fund and the role of the developing countries in the process of decision-making. These and other issues will be discussed during the forthcoming negotiations in Geneva  and we sincerely hope that they will be successfully concluded.35.	My Government is eager to strengthen the work of the Commission on Transnational Corporations. We feel that such corporations  must  without harming their effectiveness  be integrated into the economic and social framework of their host countries so that the development potential of their technology  capital and access to markets can be maximized and harnessed to the local economy.36.	In general  the various discussions set in motion in the past reflect the desire of developing countries to improve not only  the external environment in which their economies operate but also their status as participants in the process of international decision-making.37.	Parallel to these discussions with the developed countries  there have been intensive efforts to extend and intensify the degree of economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries themselves. Of course  not all the developing countries are at the same stage  of progress  and there are  in specific fields  obvious differences and gaps among them. These are precisely the differences which give rise to the possibility of complementarity in the fields  inter alia  of trade  finance  technology .and know-how. It is with great interest that we are looking forward to the forthcoming Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  which will be held in Buenos Aires next year.38.	Surinam regards it of the utmost importance that the efforts to conclude a comprehensive and universally acceptable convention on the law of the sea be pursued energetically. However  the avalanche of recent unilateral measures regarding coastal waters already proclaimed by other nations makes the proclamation of similar measures for the sea off our coast an unavoidable and urgent matter for Surinam with a view to protecting our interests in those waters. Legal measures to that effect have been submitted to Parliament and are awaiting the necessary adoption.39.	This certainly does not affect our political will to continue to contribute to and participate in the drafting of a convention on the law of the sea which will deal with the interests of the nations of the world on an equitable basis. On the contrary  the many unilateral measures have strengthened Surinam's conviction that rapid progress towards the conclusion of an acceptable convention is essential to prevent total chaos in the oceans. My delegation is deeply concerned that the absence of a strong and unified position among the smaller countries gives an open invitation to a small group of technically and financially privileged countries and to multinational corporations to establish a regime in the high seas even more rapacious than the colonial systems of the past.40.	This is the third time that my country has participated in the work of this Assembly. For Surinam the past two years have been marked by sustained efforts to broaden our economic base  by our steadfast belief in individual freedom  by our strict adherence to the rule of law  by our strong commitment to the basic principles of human rights and equality  and by our traditional sense of social justice. Our Government is determined to continue to follow this course  which has been the foundation upon which our country has been built.41.	Finally  Surinam will preserve and strengthen its friendship with the world community of nations  and I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the unswerving faith of the Government and people of Surinam in the United Nations."

Mr. President  it is a particular pleasure for me to extend to you our warm congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office is a tribute to you personally  to your vast diplomatic experience  and to the leading and constructive role played by Yugoslavia within the non-aligned movement and in the work of the United Nations.2.	I should also like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to Ambassador Amerasinghe  who presided over last year's session with such great distinction.3.	Our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  continues to serve the world community with total dedication  and I should like to express to him our deep gratitude and to assure him of Sweden's full support for his tireless efforts.4.	As this session of the General Assembly opens  it is also a particular satisfaction for us to be able to welcome two new Members to our Organization: the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose admission we have so strongly and actively supported  both in this Assembly and during our years in the Security Council.5.	When I addressed the General Assembly for the first time last year  I had special reasons to say a few words about the general guidelines of Swedish foreign policy. The foundation of that policy is neutrality. In our country we are united in the view that we should use our neutral position to pursue an active  independent and progressive foreign policy characterized by global solidarity and respect for the equal rights of all human beings. These are our guidelines as we face up to such problems as injustice insouthern Africa  the unequal relationship between rich and poor countries  or the plundering and misuse of the resources with which nature has provided us.6.	In Steven Biko the South African people has a new martyr whose death is yet another reminder that racism in southern Africa remains a festering sore in our international society. Developments in southern Africa are important -not only to those who live there. They are of crucial importance for the relations between free Africa and the rest of the world  as well as for international detente in general.7.	Apartheid is unique. It differs from other manifestations of evil and injustice in the world  for in South Africa oppression has been legalized; it is written into the country's constitution and permeates the entire fabric of society. A minority has created a system based on the idea of its own racial superiority serving to suppress the majority. Let us not forget that the United Nations was born in the struggle against a system which was obsessed by a similar idea. The undoing of apartheid must be a central obligation of the world community. To follow passively developments there is to become  in a sense  an accomplice of the present policy of an oppressive regime.8.	Every form of black African protest in South Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia has been brutally crushed. The majority of the people is denied every possibility of political expression and participation. It is understandable that the liberation movements of southern Africa  in their despair  finally have seen no alternative to armed struggle.9.	The United Nations was created to solve international conflicts by peaceful means. We must try to make it possible to achieve majority rule in southern Africa with a minimum of violence. Here the United Nations has a dual responsibility: one is to contribute to the abolishment of apartheid as soon as possible; the other is to try to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population which always follows a long liberation struggle.10.	We consider the present situation in South Africa to be a threat to international peace. The Security Council  therefore  should impose sanctions to eliminate that threat.' We have  as a first step  proposed that the recommendation already adopted by the Security Council calling for the discontinuation of all arms shipments to South Africa be broadened and transformed into a binding decision.     Sweden has also proposed further steps  including measures against new foreign investments in South Africa and Namibia. Measures of this kind have already been unilaterally taken by the Swedish Government  and plans are being considered for their reinforcement.11.	Another reason for the international tension in the area is South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its support of the rebel regime in Rhodesia. Negotiations are under way regarding both these Territories and we note with satisfaction the commitment made by a number of leading States in this matter.12.	The task in Namibia is to make possible the free elections under United Nations supervision and control envisaged in resolution 385 (1976) of the Security Council. Although the parties would seem to have come closer to an agreement as to how this process of liberation is to be carried out  South Africa is still utilizing its illegal rule in an attempt to retain influence. The Pretoria regime must realize that the only alternative to giving up control through a negotiated settlement is international sanctions and an escalation of the armed liberation struggle. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] is playing a leading part in the efforts to secure an independent and unified Namibia  and any agreement must be supported by that movement. SWAPO must also be given full opportunities of working freely in the country and of mobilizing its extensive popular following there. The United Nations will have an important and difficult task to perform during the transition to independence. We have declared our readiness to offer our services within the framework of the United Nations with a view to facilitating a peaceful transition.13.	The Anglo-American efforts to negotiate a settlement on Rhodesia encounter great difficulties  due above all to the vain hopes entertained by the leaders in Salisbury of perpetuating their minority rule by means of such tricks as a so-called  internal solution . The Smith regime's hard- headed resistance to real majority rule  backed up by South Africa  should be met with broadened international sanctions. At the same time it should be quite clear that a solution in Namibia and Zimbabwe will in no way lead to a relaxation of the world community's attitude towards apartheid in South Africa. International pressures on the apartheid regime must be maintained and intensified.14.	In the Middle East  efforts are again under way to achieve a peaceful and lasting settlement. As so often before  progress is frustratingly slow. The Swedish Government maintains the view that a solution must be based on resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. Israel and all other States in the area are entitled to their existence and integrity within secure and recognized borders. The principle that acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible must be respected. Furthermore  provision has to be made for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian Arabs  including the right to establish a State of their own which lives in peace side by side with Israel. It is essential that negotiations for a peaceful solution be opened as soon as possible. The Palestinians should be assured of participation in those negotiations.15.	Israel's policy in regard to settlements in occupied territories has added to the difficulties in the search for a solution. Sweden has consistently opposed that policy as being illegal and as complicating withdrawal from occupied territories. I appeal to the Government of Israel to abandon these measures  which are contrary to the principles of the Security Council's resolutions and which place additional obstacles in the way of a negotiated peace. Another prerequisite for a solution is a clear recognition by the representatives of the Palestinians of Israel's right to exist. Unless agreement is reached we risk a new war with terrible suffering to the peoples concerned. A new war would also threaten to involve the great Powers and thus jeopardize international peace and security.16.	The nuclear arms race continues. The accelerating development of military technology causes the superpowers to seek mutual security at a steadily rising and increasingly dangerous level of armaments. There is a risk that results achieved in the disarmament negotiations will be overtaken by the creation of new weapons systems. The super-Powers  themselves  have been among the first to claim that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) are a vital component of the process of detente. I wish to underline the importance which the Swedish Government attaches to rapid concrete progress towards an agreement at the second round of SALT talks and the subsequent opening of the third round with a view to reaching mutual security at a lower level of armaments.17.	In this context  I want to recall the present international debate on the neutron weapon  which is the latest example of the consequences of the development of technical weapons carried out by the super-Powers. The Swedish Government is deeply concerned by every development in the armaments field that could constitute a directly destabilizing factor. It is also obvious that a reversal of the present trend in the arms race of the super-Powers is a basic condition for progress in disarmament efforts. The neutron weapon is unacceptable to us. So are all other nuclear weapons.18.	International negotiating efforts in the field of disarmament have been intensified as a result of the decision to convene next spring a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. That session will present a unique opportunity to open a new and fruitful phase in the work of disarmament. It is an opportunity that we must not miss.19.	Questions concerning nuclear weapons should  of course  be given the highest priority at the session. The Swedish Government expects significant and concrete results concerning a comprehensive test ban treaty. It is important that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva should begin negotiations on this matter as soon as possible.20.	A comprehensive nuclear test ban would be a sign that the super-Powers had begun a process towards nuclear disarmament. A comprehensive test ban is at the same time an important element in the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to new States. It affects the security of both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States  of developing as well as industrialized countries. All have a common interest in co-operating in order to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear devices  the consequences of which could be truly disastrous. The Swedish Government will continue to work hard to this end.21.	Nuclear power as a source of energy raises special problems. One of them is the risk that the dissemination of nuclear technology can facilitate nuclear-weapons development. This problem is receiving increasing international recognition. The Swedish Government therefore continues to work for broader support for the Treaty on theNuclear Weapons and for the strengthening of the IAEA system of safeguards.22.	The rapid technological development in conventional armaments and the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated weapons is alarming. Sufficient attention must be given to this question during the special session to be held in 1978 on disarmament.23.	According to conservative estimates  military expenditures amounted to between $350 billion and $400 billion in 1976. This is a grotesque misuse of human and material resources. It can be compared with the $15 billion that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries provided for development assistance during that same year. The Nordic countries have proposed that the special session initiate an urgent and in-depth study of the possibility of transferring the resources released through disarmament measures to economic and social development programmes  primarily in the developing countries. Our objective is that this work should result in international as well as national action.24.	It is imperative that the special session achieve real progress towards disarmament. The results must be lasting and be followed by further steps. Sweden is in favour of a second special session being convened after a period of three to five years. The United Nations must be given sufficient means to enable it effectively to play its important role in the continued efforts towards disarmament.25.	The Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts was concluded in June this year after making important progress. It is now essential to redouble our efforts in this field. The aim must be a definite prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons that are excessively injurious.26.	Our efforts to achieve peace and security must also comprise action against all kinds of internal oppression We strongly condemn all forms of persecution of people on account of their political or religious convictions  race or ethnic identity  wherever this persecution may be practised During the past year we have had occasion in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  in government statements and in bilateral contacts  to denounce the policies of a number of Governments in this respect Sweden will continue to give unrelenting support to the struggle for human rights.27.	We have all seen how terror can be used by individuals Acts such as those that have recently taken place in the Federal Republic of Germany must be met with the condemnation of the world community. These outrageous manifestations of distorted minds demonstrate the importance of the work being carried out in the United Nations to prevent terrorism.28.	Several important tasks await the General Assembly this autumn. We must increase our efforts to strengthen safeguards against torture. The 1975 declaration on this subject was a step forward  although its practical consequences have as yet not been very significant. A legally binding convention must be our goal.29.	At the last session of the General Assembly Sweden raised the question of the treatment of persons imprisoned for their political convictions.  Our proposal  which has gamed widespread support  will be considered at this session. We shall work to have a resolution adopted now30.	Ever since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Sweden has worked to convert separate articles of the Declaration into binding international conventions. Thus  we find it encouraging that the two International Covenants on Human Rights-one on civil and political rights and its Optional Protocol  the other on economic  social and cultural rights have entered into force. However  to attain the objectives of the Covenants  efficient implementation machinery is necessary. So far  only a small number of countries have accepted the competence of the Human Rights Committee to consider allegations by an individual or a country that a State has violated his or her human rights. We strongly urge all countries that have not already done so to accept the competence of the Human Rights Committee in this field.	 31. The right of all human beings to meaningful employment and the satisfaction of their basic material needs are other human rights. We are aware that these rights are also still denied to a large segment of the world population. The number of unemployed and underemployed is continuously increasing. More than 1 billion people now live in conditions below the subsistence level. The possibilities to secure reasonable material living conditions for all depend on the capacity of our earth to provide the resources needed  and on our own ability to distribute those resources equitably The future supply of a large number of primary products which play a key -role in our economic life is in question We have become acutely aware that oil  one of our most important primary products  will already become increasingly scarce within only a decade or two. Nuclear power entails special problems and risks and is also based on a primary product of limited existence. The fertility of the earth cannot meet ever-growing demands. If we permit continued land erosion and continue polluting air  water and soil  the situation will rapidly become even more serious. It is therefore necessary that we-primarily the rich countries-learn to economize resources and to take into account the ecological consequences of our activities. We must learn to use without using up  to recycle raw materials instead of piling up growing mountains of waste products.32.	At the same time  the poor countries must be given scope for increased consumption.33.	One of the most important tasks of the United Nations in the period to come is  as I see it  to engage Member States in safeguarding the environment  in improving management of the earth's resources  in developing a resource-preserving technology based on renewable resources and in achieving their reasonable and equitable distribution. A part of this task must be the development of global co-operation on energy.34.	The problems which spring from the inequitable relations between North and South  between industrial and developing countries  have formed the subject of several important negotiations during the past years. Important international negotiations are now in progress or are pending in many vital sectors. These include the trade sector  with major multilateral trade talks under the aegis of GATT. As to raw materials  the main focus of attention is on negotiations concerning UNICTAD's Integrated Programme for Commodities. The United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for. Commodities will be reconvened in November. Negotiations are being held in New York on an international code of conduct for transnational corporations.35.	We want to see practical results from those negotiations. A means must be found of stabilizing the commodity markets. We must join in assuming responsibility for developments in the energy sector  with due regard to the interests of all concerned. The United Nations target for official assistance—0.7 per cent of gross national product- must be achieved before the close of this decade. Here those industrial countries which are now lagging far behind have a special responsibility. The trade of the developing countries must be boosted. Means must urgently be found to ease the debt burden of developing countries  particularly the public debts of the least developed countries.36.	The outcome of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation can by no means be termed satisfactory as measured against development needs. No agreement was reached regarding several important problems  nor was it possible to bring about important structural changes aiming at a new international economic order. Still  it is our view that the Conference did achieve some positive results.37.	Our task will now be to consolidate those results and search for new ways to solve the remaining problems. Sweden will press for vigorous initiatives from the United Nations in this respect. This becomes even more urgent against the depressing background of the impending failure of the most important parts of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade . So far  the 1970s have brought no substantial improvements in the living standards of the poorest groups. Inequality within many countries has also increased. It is therefore of particular importance to bring about concrete measures to satisfy the basic needs as regards food  housing  work  education and health. The Nordic Foreign Ministers at their recent meeting emphasized how important it was that the work for the new development strategy now be started. The present session of the General Assembly must seize the opportunity to set about these tasks.38.	In all of these sectors  decisions will have to be taken which bring substantial benefits to the developing countries.39.	An essential aspect of the new international economic order concerns the utilization of the tremendous potential for development that exists in the developing countries themselves. Collective and individual self-reliance are concepts that have emerged during our discussions. Sweden supports these ideas and stands ready to contribute to their implementation. Building up domestic technological and production capability adapted to the particular requirements in each country is an important element of self- reliance. This process should also create the necessary conditions and facilities to meet the needs of the great majority of the population.40.	The ultimate aim of the new international economic order is to create a just and equitable world. This is also the ultimate aim of our struggle for human rights. In planning for change we must be mindful of the needs of all people  irrespective of colour  sex and age. When old traditions are abandoned  when established structures are broken up  there is a risk that vulnerable groups become even more underprivileged. Women constitute one such group. The statements from the United Nations women's Conference must therefore be translated into practical action as we now press on towards the realization of the new international economic order. When planning for change we must also pay greater attention to children in our development efforts. The International Year of the Child in 1979 should  among other things  help to make us realize this.41.	It is easy to lapse into pessimism when we survey the problems that beset our world. I believe  however  that it would be wrong to concentrate on the gloomy side of the picture. It is  after all  not violence and poverty which distinguish our own age from other periods of history. Both these phenomena are as old as humanity itself. What is new in today's world is that  in spite of everything  efforts are being made across national boundaries to tackle these problems on a common international basis.42.	True  the progress that has so far been made may seem small compared to the vast dimensions of the problems. We would do well to bear in mind that global co-operation has only existed for a brief moment in the many thousand years of human history. It is my firm belief that this co-operation will steadily grow in importance and scope  if only for the simple reason that our problems will sooner or later force us to find global solutions. The world we live in has become too small for national egoism. Global solidarity is the only possible base for a future solution of world problems. The existence of the United Nations and the open debate which we are able to conduct here testify to a growing awareness of this fact. Our task at this Assembly session is now to do our utmost to live up to this challenge. 	"
"121",6566,"SWZ",32,1977,"﻿76.	Mr. President  I wish to express my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of this historic session of the United Nations General Assembly. I bring with me to you  Mr. President  cordial greetings from my Head of State  His Majesty  King Sobhuza II and the Government and people of Swaziland. Your election symbolizes the recognition of your stature as a statesman  and we have complete confidence that a man of your wide experience and calibre will successfully guide our deliberations.77.	In congratulating you  Mr. President  we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing President  Ambassador Amerasinghe  the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka and able President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  for the efficient and wise leadership which he demonstrated during the thirty- first session of this Assembly.78.	My delegation warmly welcomes the admission of the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to an. Organization founded to harmonize the actions of nations in maintaining international peace and security  and in encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.79.	My delegation has confidence  hope and faith that in such an august gathering substantial and significant progress towards removing the obstacles that lie in the way of freedom  peace  justice  and the pursuit of happiness and international understanding can be achieved at this  our thirty-second  session.80.	Our experience over the last nine years since we regained our independence  has been that social and economic growth  social justice and democracy are legitimate aspirations on this planet if the international community displays the necessary political will.81.	It is in this context that His Majesty's Government has continued to support and to work for the achievement of a new international economic order in which the world's resources will be equitably distributed among its peoples.82.	We should spare no effort to accelerate the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world. At present  world trade and development are controlled and dominated by a small group of privileged countries. The economic fortunes of those nations determined the fortunes of the rest of the world. Growth prospects for the non-oil-producing developing world have worsened  their per capita incomes have fallen and the gap between rich and poor has widened.83.	It is for those reasons that my Government appreciates the efforts made by all the participants in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation towards the establishment of more equitable relations between the developed and the developing countries. The dialogue process itself did in some degree contribute to an understanding of the complex problems of international economic co-operation and to the need for bold decisions to effect structural adjustments in the present system.84.	My Government regrets that the Conference failed to reach decisions on a wide number of issues of importance to us developing countries and that it did not achieve the expected break-through. That Conference fell too far short of its objective  and no meaningful progress was made towards the restructuring of the new international economic order.85.	In spite of the differences over the assessment of the Paris Conference which were manifested during the 108th and 109th meetings of the Assembly's thirty-first session  my delegation was none the less encouraged to detect a spirit of determination on both sides to continue the dialogue in a purposeful manner with a view to arriving at tangible and meaningful results.86.	On the brighter side of the North-South dialogue  my delegation was pleased to note that the concept of promoting economic co-operation among developing countries was given • attention. Due to our need for larger markets to overcome the constraints of critical minimum- size operations and to make economies of scale  my country attaches great importance to efforts to strengthen regional co-operation and integration.87.	The promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries is based on the realization of the heed to rely first on ourselves for achieving social and economic development. It emphasizes the importance of depending on our own efforts to develop ourselves. The spirit of self-reliance and the determination needed to advance ourselves is a necessary and decisive factor in overcoming the heavy odds that we face as developing nations.88.	Concrete results have yet to be achieved in the North-South dialogue  and until such time as the developing world can be united in common action to achieve a common ""goal conference and talks will have little effect. Until such time as it is possible for the developing world to confront the developed world on more equal terms  theGovernment of Swaziland will continue to work relentlessly for vital reforms of the international economic and financial system. Trade flows must be increased  debt must be rescheduled and schemes must be introduced to stabilize commodity prices. We shall strive to achieve those ends through the years ahead.89.	Swaziland believes that if people have no stake in the community of man they become a threat to that community. Peace and stability are threatened by a divided community; yet all of us are very much aware that the division continues to introduce into the modern world unnecessary disharmony and conflicts of interest which disastrously divide mankind at a time when unity of purpose and action is so vital for peace  order and progress in the service of mankind.90.	Swaziland's policy remains strongly that of a non- racial democracy based on non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  good neighbourliness  non-alignment and respect for peace  justice and equality. We practise and cherish those concepts as principles enshrined in both the Charter of the United Nations and in the Charter of the OAU. Swaziland is most decidedly against any form of denial of human rights or fundamental freedoms which results in the degradation of the human person. In this regard  my country is greatly distressed and perturbed by the situation across our borders in the Republic of South Africa  where the tragic death of innocent people  including defenceless children  and a total contempt and disregard for the rule of law have become a way of life.91.	As representatives may know  in the recent past Swaziland has given material assistance to some of the students who had fled from South Africa because of the Soweto tragedy.92.	We remain more strongly convinced than ever before that the racially discriminatory apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa militate against the essential dignity and equality of all human beings  and hope' that efforts to arrive at a peaceful solution to the grave problems of that beleaguered country will be found.93.	Namibia is an international Territory under illegal occupation  in defiance of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and decisions of the International Court of Justice. Its people  like all other peoples  have the right to self-determination to enable them freely to exercise their right to complete freedom and national independence so that they can  with speed  take their rightful place in this Assembly.94.	With respect to Zimbabwe  speaking from this very podium  my delegation has expressed the view that so long as the privileged white minority in Rhodesia was allowed to exercise the monopoly of political power  the illegal regime of Ian Smith would not voluntarily relinquish that power. Today  however  the very efficacy of the freedom movement has forced upon Smith the realization that Zimbabwe is on the threshold of freedom and independence. We believe that it is the indigenous people of Zimbabwe themselves who must together work out their salvation and shape their destiny in an atmosphere of dedication. It is in that context that Swaziland welcomes the Anglo-American proposals as constituting a basis for further negotiations for the restoration of legality in Zimbabwe.95.	In the Middle East  the attainment of a just and lasting peace remains a matter of major concern to the international community. A viable peace settlement of the Middle East conflict is of vital importance to the world as a whole. A just and lasting peace settlement must  taking Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) as starting- points  take account of the following principles: first  the right of all States in the region must be respected  including Israel's right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; secondly  Israel should withdraw from all the territories it has occupied since 1967; thirdly  the legitimate right of the Palestinian people must be reaffirmed; and fourthly  the Palestinian people must have a right to a secure homeland.96.	It is the earnest hope of my delegation that the renewed peace efforts now under way will lead to a durable and lasting peace settlement and that all the parties concerned will refrain from any action that would constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of peace.97.	The past history of Africa reveals that it has been a continent of drama and tragedy. The scars of slavery and the wounds of imperialism and exploitation are all too fresh to have been forgotten. But the future is different. It is a future of hope  a future of a socio-political evolution towards the larger community of a united Africa  a future ultimately to banish any patronizing by big Powers in a continent that is being rebuilt from the ashes of colonialism  a future without racial discrimination and  indeed  a future of inspiration that we shall for certain triumph and regain our glory as a free continent.98.	It is for those reasons of hope that my country  together with the non-aligned countries of the third world  has consistently demanded the withdrawal of any naval and military presence from the Indian Ocean by great Powers  because we who rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on our doorstep also regard it as a zone of peace.99.	I turn now to the establishment of a new international economic order over the oceans  which encompass two- thirds of our planet. Swaziland as a land-locked  developing country  has a vital stake in the successful outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.100.	It is indeed regrettable that a lack of political will has so far prevented the making of hard negotiating choices. There must be a recognition that the future law of the sea must be comprehensive and acceptable to all segments of the international community.101.	Such recognition would necessarily imply that the concept of the common heritage of mankind must be so interpreted as to result in preferential treatment being accorded to geographically disadvantaged developing States. Likewise  the acceptance by land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States of the ""economic zone concept"" must be necessarily dependent on their guaranteed right of participation in the exploitation of the resources of such zones.102.	Compromise and a pragmatic approach are therefore essential prerequisites for a successful outcome of the Conference. We believe that the informal composite negotiating text  despite its many short-comings  contains some of the elements for a constructive outcome at the forthcoming Geneva session of the Conference in March 1978.103.	Swaziland has served as a model of racial tolerance  where black and white live in peace and harmony. We have continued to set an example and to demonstrate that national peace and harmony can be achieved by showing respect for human dignity and equality  and by giving every individual an opportunity to play a positive role in shaping the destiny of his country.104.	Before I conclude my statement I should like to pay  on behalf of my delegation  a special tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and the dedicated members of his. staff  to whom we convey our deeply felt gratitude and appreciation for their ceaseless energy and dedication to the cause of peace and to the promotion of international co-operation.105.	In conclusion  may I once again pledge my country's commitment to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to abide by all United Nations resolutions. "
"122",6601,"SYC",32,1977,"﻿228. First of all  Mr. President  allow me to extend to you the felicitations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. I must also congratulate you on your distinguished career as a diplomat in the service of your country  especially in advancing and promoting the principle and practice of non-alignment.229.	To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  we address a sincere tribute for his initiatives in pursuance of the cause of peace.230.	Although new ourselves as a Member of the United Nations  we welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  which are now Members of this world Organization  and to them we offer and extend the assurance of our co-operation.231.	This is the second occasion in which a Seychelles delegation has attended a General Assembly session  but the first at which the new Government of Seychelles  which was formed on 5 June this year  has been represented. This occasion  therefore  provides my delegation with the opportunity to make known the views and policies of my Government on a number of important matters. However  before I pass to consideration of the international scene  it is necessary to correct any misapprehension that may have gained currency as a result of the speech made by the then President of Seychelles on the occasion of Seychelles' admission as a Member of the United Nations in September last year. Mr. Mancham stated then:""Britain  which took over from the French  has guided us with an attitude of friendly enlightenment over the years  and in this spirit readily and unreservedly granted us independence on 29 June this year.""This is simply not true  as it gives the very definite and wrong impression that the people of Seychelles did not have to struggle for their independence. Even if there was no bloodshed  the Seychelles did have to battle over a period of many years for independence. Individuals were sent to prison for their political beliefs or party affiliation in support of independence. Even in April 1974  at the time of the last general election in my country  public meetings and processions were prohibited for a month under the Public Order Act. And when there were gatherings of workers and others at this time  these gatherings were dispersed with tear gas. A number of persons were injured and  indeed  some of them are still suffering as a result of the injuries sustained then. Quite a number were imprisoned.232.	That those actions were taken was not the immediate result of British Government decisions  but they did occur under the British Administration at that time in Seychelles  and certain British officials on the spot were responsible for them.233.	As I mentioned earlier and as  I believe  is widely known  there was a change of Government in my country just a little under a year after independence. Those responsible for toppling the previous Government were prompted to do so by a number of reasons; but the principal one was the proposal by the then President that the general election due in June 1979 at the latest  should be postponed for five years beyond that date. That proposal was considered to be a threat to democracy and a step along the path to dictatorship. The new Government  which assumed office after the coup  is pledged to hold a general election within the next two years under a new constitution which is currently the subject of consultations with the people throughout the country. Indeed a constitutional council will be set up in the near future to draft the new constitution  taking into account the views of the people.234.	Now that Seychelles' has been finally and truly liberated  my Government wishes to express its deep and sincere gratitude to the OAU in particular  but also to all those who individually assisted  for the part they played and the contribution they made. It is also appropriate and right that in this forum my delegation should record the appreciation of the new Seychelles Government for the aid of all kinds that the country received  both prior to independence and since  on a bilateral and multilateral basis. Without this aid  our political independence could not be properly consolidated and made meaningful.235.	Turning to international affairs  my delegation would like to mention that it is our Government's intention that Seychelles should be completely non-aligned  so that we do not immediately and automatically line up with one State or bloc irrespective of the rights or wrongs of any particular international issue. Small though we are  we reserve the right to make our own assessment of each question and  without fear or favour  to criticize when we consider criticism is due and to praise when praise is merited. But we shall make no attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.236.	The present Government accepts and will honour all the international agreements made by its predecessor in office and  indeed  all agreements that the country inherited at the time of its independence on 29 June last year.237.	In a spirit of friendly neighbourliness and a belief in regional co-operation  we shall endeavour to promote and strengthen links with our neighbours in Africa and around the Indian Ocean.238.	There are a number of international questions of perhaps more immediate concern to Seychelles  given its geographical location and its membership in the OAU.239.	Let me first make reference to the question of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  which  of course  has already been the subject of United Nations resolutions  but which continues to be of considerable concern to countries in and around the Indian Ocean. Seychelles subscribes whole-heartedly to the concept of the Indian Ocean zone of peace. While the countries of the Indian Ocean have a legitimate right to guard and to provide for their own interests  for us the concept of the Indian Ocean zone of peace means that there should be no super-Power military bases or facilities there—indeed  no permanent super-Power presence of a military nature of any kind. The sooner this can be achieved  the better. Neither should the superpowers arm certain countries in the area in order to use them as pawns in their own power struggle.240.	I must also mention two matters which have been raised by many representatives in their addresses and which are at the moment being discussed in different forums of the United Nations. They are the new international economic order and the law of the sea.241.	The major economic problem facing the world today is the wide gap between the standard of living of the advanced industrial countries and that of the developing countries. It is also a political problem  because the disparity between developed and developing countries transcends political ideologies. As a third-world country  Seychelles joins other developing countries in the urgent demand for a new international economic order. We believe that there must be fundamental changes in the structure of economic dominance and inequality. We also believe that such changes must proceed and apply universality  and not sectorally. Whatever changes are finally agreed upon must depend on human needs and conditions.242.	As regards the law of the sea  we in the Republic of Seychelles attach very great importance to the formulation of a new law  of the sea. The sea is one area which we will exploit for our resources. We hope that at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea a satisfactory conclusion can be reached.243.	Turning now to the question of southern Africa  which has three constituent elements—namely  Namibia  Zimbabwe  and the apartheid system in South Africa—the Seychelles delegation wishes to make its Government's position quite clear and unequivocal. Firstly  Namibia should become an independent State as soon as possible. Participants in all talks leading to independence and on the future constitution of the country must include a delegation from SWAPO  which is the one organization really representative of the people of Namibia. There can be no conditions attaching to this country's independence. Like all other countries  and as provided in the United Nations Charter  Namibia has the right to self-determination. Constitutional talks must be held and must result in agreement on a constitution and on the election of a parliament on the basis of universal adult franchise  under the supervision of the United Nations or OAU to ensure no undue pressure is applied by anyone.244.	As regards Zimbabwe  Seychelles adheres fully to the OAU resolution adopted at the recent summit in Libreville  in which it is stated that there should be full support for the Patriotic Front in its efforts to liberate the country; that the people of Zimbabwe should be afforded political   material and financial assistance to regain their rights to self-determination and independence; and that the question of the political leadership of the country  after the ouster of the Smith regime and the attainment of independence  must be left to the people of Zimbabwe to decide on the basis of universal adult suffrage.245.	There is little to be said about apartheid that has not been said before in condemnation of that odious and inhuman system  except that it has to be ended just as soon as possible  and to that end all right-thinking Members of the United Nations must lend all their support and efforts.246.	As regards the Palestinian cause  we believe that the Palestinians should have a right to a homeland of their own and that the Israelis should withdraw immediately from the occupied Arab territories.247.	As to Western Sahara  my Government yesterday officially recognized the Frente POLISARIO in its attempt to liberate the people of that region. I shall now read the text of a telegram the President of the Republic of Seychelles has sent to Mr. Mohamed Abdelaziz  President of the Revolutionary Command and Secretary-General of the Frente POLISARIO  the movement which is currently engaged in an armed struggle:""It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Seychelles and on my own behalf formally to extend our official recognition of Sahawri Arab Democratic Republic. We have followed with great interest the valiant campaign being carried out by the Polisario Front in its attempt to liberate the people of Saguiet el Hamra and Rio de Oro and will endeavour to assist you in every way possible on the diplomatic front and in international forums to free your country from foreign occupation.""248.	The official recognition of the Government of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic coincides with the date originally set for an OAU summit meeting that was to have been held in Lusaka  Zambia  to discuss the question of Western Sahara. That meeting was unfortunately postponed on account of the security situation in Zambia. And once again the future of the Sahawan people was shelved for an indefinite period. My Government's decision is a demonstration of its solidarity with legitimate liberation movements on the African mainland and of its sympathy with the ideals of the Frente POLISARIO  which coincide with the aims of the Seychelles People's United Party  as manifested during its own liberation struggle against colonialism.249.	We hopefully wish that much of the world unrest will be solved at this thirty-second session of the General Assembly."
"123",6636,"SYR",32,1977,"﻿181.	Mr. President  may I first of all warmly congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. The universal confidence placed in you by delegations of the entire world is clear evidence of the high esteem that the world community has for your people and country  which was one of the pioneers of the non-aligned movement. Your great experience in international affairs  as well as your wisdom and knowledge  give promise that you will contribute considerably to the success of the work of this session.182.	I should also wish to praise the constructive role played by Mr. Amerasinghe  the outgoing President  who conducted the work of the previous session with flexibility and insight and in a manner that confirmed the excellent traits of character for which he is renowned.183.	A few days ago  our Assembly enthusiastically received two new Members. They are the Republic of Djibouti  which won its independence recently following a bitter struggle for freedom and self-determination  and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose people fought for over 30 years to achieve independence and the unity of their homeland and made enormous sacrifices in their struggle against the fiercest colonialist and imperialist forces. We hail Arab Djibouti and friendly Viet Nam  whose admission to membership in the Untied Nations will undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the role of the international community and the consolidation of its universality.184.	By placing our issues and attitudes before the General Assembly  we are affirming our belief that the world Organization must be the effective instrument to strengthen international peace and security and to establish equal and equitable relations among nations. Despite the achievements already realized by this Organization in all domains  we find it imperative to express our deep concern over the non-implementation of many resolutions adopted by the various United Nations organs  and over the persistent violations of the principles of the Charter and the abu3e of some of the privileges defined in it. We have all witnessed the unfair use of the veto in the Security Council in certain cases. The nations of the world do not wish problems to be merely pinpointed. Rather do they demand that we seek solutions  which they want to see carried out. This can be done only through showing due respect for the United Nations Charter and for the will of the world community.185.	The one-year interval between the present session and the previous one revealed some major changes in  and facts about  the world of today. Some steps were taken to eliminate tension and to strengthen the concept of international detente. In contrast  peace and stability are still remote and beyond the reach of some peoples and regions. Attempts continue to be made to impose new forms of subservience on those peoples. Such attempts occur from time to time  in Africa  Asia and Latin America.186.	A major and most essential global issue faced by our Organization today is the economic relations prevailing in the contemporary world. The problem is represented by the sharp contrast between the will of the international community  which has defined the bases of the new economic order  and; the attempts made by certain forces to obstruct the solution of problems that are worsening every day. The current crisis of the world economic order is being aggravated with the passing of time  and the developing nations have become victims of this chronic disease.187.	This situation  which has never been witnessed before by the world  is a natural outcome of the crisis dominating current economic relations. It is a crisis that was engendered in the old colonialism era and kept active and growing in the era of imperialism and neocolonialism.188.	All this prompts us to stress the need to change the present economic order  it is here that the role of our international Organization should be conspicuous  and in particular that of the General Assembly  which must contribute seriously and effectively to the removal of the obstacles and difficulties that are blocking the way to the establishment of a new order  towards the application of whose principles no progress whatsoever Ins been made.189.	The maintenance of international peace and security  the easing of tensions and the safeguarding of the world from the holocaust of war and from various forms of armed conflicts are all directly linked to finding the solution of a number of issues and problems which the United Nations has for so many years been tackling at each of its regular sessions.190.	The decolonization process which has taken successful steps within the framework of the United Nations at times stumbles in certain areas because of the obstinacy and manoeuvres of some colonialist Powers. Racism in all its manifestations persists in its oppression and its defiance of the world to the extent that it is extending me limits of its aggressions to the neighbouring independent nations. The racist regimes in Africa could not survive and persist in their oppression and aggression were it not for the political  military and economic support they are receiving from some Western countries  and were it not for the identity of fate that links those regimes with the Zionist racist entity in occupied Palestine. We are certain that victory will be achieved by those peoples still labouring under the yoke of racism  and that the peoples of South Africa  Zimbabwe and Namibia will be liberated.191.	The situation in Korea remains a cause of dangerous tension. This prompts us to stress again the need to have all foreign troops withdrawn from Korea  to have the military Armistice Agreement replaced by a peace agreement and to start a dialogue between the two parts of Korea with a view to peaceful reunification of the country.192.	The Cyprus issue is still fraught with tension and a possible heightening of such tension-especially following the demise of President Makarios. Hence  it has become necessary to expedite the search for a solution based on negotiations between the two communities on the island under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  on the principles of resolution 3212  adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session  and with due respect for the sovereignty of Cyprus  its independence  territorial integrity and unity  as well as its non-alignment.193.	The actions taken by the United Nations in the field of disarmament and the progress realize  so far have been meagre and unsatisfactory. We appreciate the significance of the role which the United Nations could play in this domain  since international peace and security cannot be maintained without total and comprehensive disarmament. This can be achieved only when ail peoples and nations are able to enjoy security based on justice and to sense respect for their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and their right to choose the system they wish to adopt  and only if all forms of aggression  exploitation  colonialism and racism are eliminated.194.	We attach great importance to the guaranteeing of freedom and the basic rights of r. an which represent a substantial factor for liberation and the elimination of subservience  exploitation and foreign domination. In this connexion  it is imperative to stress that human rights cannot be enforced under conditions allowing the exercise of force  oppression and suppression  the persistence of all forms of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination  and where human beings are deprived of their country  their land and their homes. Such conditions are clearly seen in the sufferings of the Africans living under racist regimes in South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia. They are also clearly shown in the sufferings of the Palestinians living under Zionist racism in occupied Palestine-; or in exile outside Palestine.195.	The explosive situation in the Middle East is certainly foremost among the issues that engage the attention of the international community  which is striving to seek a solution to that situation because of the sure relationship between peace and security	region and peace and security in the world at large.196.	The existing situation is the result of Israel's intransigence and continuing aggression against the rights of the people of Palestine and against the occupied Arab territories.' Israel is thereby violating the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations. The recent Israeli measures aimed at applying Israeli laws to the Arab inhabitants of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  and at establishing new settlements in the occupied Palestinian and Arab lands as a prelude to their annexation to Israel  are aggravating the situation.197.	The impact of an explosion of the situation in the Middle East might not be limited to the countries of that region: rather  it would imperil the whole world. We all remember that the 1973 October war brought the world to the verge of nuclear war because of conflicting international interests in the Middle East region. That region has 70 per cent of the world's oil reserves  and through it pass the routes of international communications between east and west. Hence  all talk about peace in the world is incomplete if peace is not achieved in the Middle East.198.	We  the Arabs  realize this fact. We are part of the world. The attainment of world peace concerns us as much as it concerns the other nations of the world. Through peace we can ensure the prosperity and welfare of our peoples. We have repeatedly and on all occasions declared our sincere desire for peace. However  Israel has always reacted by further intransigence. Every step we took towards peace was met by Israeli steps escalating actions conducive to the obstruction of peace.199.	Ever since its creation  Israel has been pursuing a constant policy based on expansion and the acquisition of more Arab territories. It is persisting in implementing this policy  heedless of the wishes of the international community and disregarding the lessons of the 1973 October war. The statements made by Menachem Begin since the first day after the Likud won the elections prove the validity of my assertion. It would take me some time to list all those statements. However  I shall refer to a few of them in order to give you an idea of the course the Israeli leaders are pursuing.200.	On 17 May 1977 Menachem Begin declared that the West Bank was an integral part of what he termed Israel's  historical homeland .201.	On 18 May 1977 Begin declared that the new Israeli Government would call upon Israeli youth to settle in the occupied territories since they were part of the  land of Israel. He added that there was no need to annex the West Bank because  no one would annex what is his. He also stated that his Government would not call the West Bank  an occupied territory  but  rather   a liberated territory   and that Israel would not withdraw from the West Bank since it was  an integral part of Israel. He added that the Arab leaders must become aware of that fact.202.	On 23 May 1977  in a declaration published by the French weekly L'Express  Begin  in reply to a question as to whether his Government intended to annex the West Bank to Israel  said that only foreign territories were usually annexed  while the West Bank was  a liberated territory .203.	On 7 September 1977  Begin declared that  every Jew has the right to settle in the land of Israel  and that the West Bank fell within the  historical boundaries of the land of Israel . He has also made other similar declarations and statements which you must have read when they were made.204.	Nevertheless  I find it imperative at this point to refer to the statement made on 9 September 1977 by General Ariel Sharon  Israel's Minister of Agriculture  when he disclosed that Israel had secretly established 10 settlements during last August. Sharon said:  The United States must understand that the settlement of Jews in Arab territories is more important than peace .205.	That statement alone is  I believe  sufficient to shed light on Israel's expansionist intentions and on the extent of its adherence to peace. I must also refer to the plan announced by General Sharon to double Israel's population so as to bring it up to 6 million. I would like to ask  How can Israel  within its small area  assimilate that many people  and how could such a plan be carried out other than through plans aimed at the occupation of more Arab territories?206.	Begin has implemented his ideas about the  historical  homeland . He has taken a series of measures aimed at annexing the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to Israel by applying Israeli laws to the population of those areas. The timing chosen by Israel to announce those measures is significant  as they were announced only a few days after the last visit of the United States Secretary of State to the countries of the region. Israel's intention is explicit and clear: to undermine the efforts exerted by the United States Secretary of State to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference.207.	Israel was established on aggression and it cannot survive without aggression. Peace is indeed incompatible with its aggressive and expansionist plans aimed at annexing Arab lands and expanding at the expense of the Arabs. Therefore  it has always resorted to placing obstacles in the way of peace and worked to undermine efforts at achieving peace. It is within this context that we can interpret Israel's attitudes and policies from its inception to the present time.208.	Just one glance at Israel's proposals for peace in the Middle East confirms what I have just said. Those proposals are  in fact  no more than attempts to undermine the efforts which are being exerted to solve the conflict in the Middle East. Moreover  they are attempts to perpetuate the present situation and to confront the world with a fait accompli  which is in line with Israel's traditional policy. Those proposals do not have the remotest chance of achieving peace  for the following reasons.209.	First  those proposals ignore the fact that the Palestine issue is the origin of the Middle East conflict  and disregard the rights of the Palestinian people. They misrepresent the situation as an issue of refugees who can settle in the neighbouring Arab countries  and ignore the fact that the problem is one of a people that was expelled from its land and homeland  to which it wishes to return to determine its own fate there. This right to self-determination has been recognized by the United Nations.210.	Secondly  Israel refuses to withdraw to the borders of 4 June 1967  and affirms its intention of retaining part of those territories-foremost among which are Jerusalem  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip—thereby violating the United Nations Charter and the relevant United Nations resolutions.211.	Thirdly  Israel is laying down pre-conditions for convening any peace conference. It refuses to allow the participation in such a conference of the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is regarded by the world community as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine. Israel also denies that people the right to establish its State in Palestine  as is stipulated in General Assembly resolution 323.212.	This having been said  allow me to put this question to you. If Israel insists on retaining the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem  if it refuses to withdraw from all the territories belonging to Syria and Egypt which were occupied in 1967 and if it also refuses to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people  how do the Israelis conceive of the possibility of the establishment of peace in such conditions?213.	On numerous occasions we have declared our genuine and sincere desire to attain peace in this region of the world. It is this desire that prompts us to welcome any effort exerted to establish peace in our region. We have declared that the peace we desire and strive for is the peace that would lead  first  to Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  and secondly to securing the national rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their own independent State  their right to self-determination and their right to return  in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions  to their lands from which they have been excluded since 1948. The acceptance of these two conditions is the key to a just and durable peace in the Middle East.214.	Israel would be very much mistaken were it to believe that it could impose its will on the Arabs and perpetuate the present situation  or if it believed for a single second that the Arabs would cede one inch of their territories or any of their rights. The hysterical military threats recently reiterated by the Israeli military leaders will not frighten or alarm us. History has taught us that the party that makes threats is not always the winner. The history of nazism is not so remote as to be forgotten; nor is the October war. Throughout history our people have made enormous sacrifices and have endured many sufferings to defend their rights. Today they stand ready to make more sacrifices for their land  their rights  their freedom and their dignity.215.	Never in the history of this international Organization has a Member State flouted the United Nations as Israel has done. Israel has violated the Charter  disregarded United Nations resolutions and defied the will of the international community. I need not list all such violations now since they have become a daily occurrence and members are quite familiar with them.216.	We all know that Israel was admitted to the United Nations under resolution 273 (III). Moreover  we all know that Israel's admission under the said resolution was conditional upon the fulfilment of the following two conditions: first  that it undertake to comply fully with the United Nations Charter from the first day of its admission to membership; and secondly  that it carry out the provisions of resolution 181 (II)  on partition  and of resolution 194(111) by permitting the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. The then Foreign Minister of Israel undertook at the time to accept the two conditions. Needless to say the undertaking was dishonest. Israel has not honoured either of the two conditions. Resolution 194(111) remains a dead letter and the same applies to resolution 181 (II)  since Israel has occupied territories four times as large as the territories allotted to it under the partition resolution.217.	Israel is practicing a policy contrary to the aims of the United Nations Charter  the rules of international law  the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity  human rights and basic human freedoms. Accordingly Israel is not worthy to be a Member of the United Nations  We call upon the international community to apply against Israel those sanctions provided for in the Charter  and to reconsider resolution 273  under which Israel was admitted to United Nations membership.218.	The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned Israel for violating the fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Arab territories. The Commission considered those violations to be war crimes and an affront to mankind.219.	It is regrettable and unfortunate to see certain big Powers  instead of dealing with Israel on the above basis  extending to it all sorts of military and economic aid and assistance and supplying it with the most up-to-date lethal weapons  as if Israel were the victim of aggression  as if it had not perpetrated a brutal aggression against an entire people by expelling them from their homes and lands  and as if it were not occupying territories of three States Members of the United Nations. Such military and economic assistance increases Israel's greed and ravenous appetite for expansion and aggression  as well as heightening its intransigence and its defiance of United Nations resolutions. Had those Powers sided with right and justice and had they stood firmly against Israeli intransigence and arrogance  Israel would not have dared to pursue a policy which is in direct contravention of the United Nations Charter and resolutions.220.	We appeal to all States to cease extending any economic or military aid to Israel and to refrain from giving it any form of help  since such help would inevitably lead to perpetuating the present situation and would encourage Israel to continue its aggressive action against the rights of the people of Palestine and against the occupied Arab territories.221.	Given the responsibilities entrusted by the United Nations Charter to the Security Council regarding the maintenance of world peace  and in view of the fact that Israeli practices and policies constitute a grave danger to that peace and threaten the gravest consequences  we request the Security Council to put an end to such practices and to take the necessary steps to cancel all Israeli measures imposed in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  notably those relating to annexation  colonization and Judaization.222.	I have outlined the situation in the Middle East with all its gravity and dangers. Peace in our region depends upon your sincere desire to enforce the provisions of the United Nations Charter as well as on the help you give us and the support you lend to our just struggle. We look forward to your help and backing since thereby you would strengthen the United Nations and its power and consolidate world peace  which is our common objective."
"124",6681,"TCD",32,1977,"﻿43.	 The adoption in 1945 of the Charter of the United Nations marked a step forward towards the establishment of the rule of the law that should govern relations among nations. The respect for and observance of the universal principles stated in that important document should facilitate the maintenance of international peace and security  which are the fundamental goals of our Organization. My country remains deeply dedicated to the sacred principles of the Charter; in particular the principles of non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States; strict respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State; non-recourse to force in international relations  and the peaceful settlement of disputes through negotiation  mediation  conciliation or arbitration. Unfortunately  we note that these principles are flouted by certain States.44.	The thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly is taking place at a crucial moment in the history of my country. Chad has been subjected to serious aggression on the part of Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi's Libya  which has  since 1973  placed the Aozou Strip in the north under military occupation  and to his constant interference in our internal affairs."" This interference is designed to overthrow the lawful Government of Chad through Chad traitors and mercenaries  to perpetuate the occupation of the Aozou Strip and to break up the State of Chad with a view to satisfying expansionist designs  on the one hand and  on the other  to set up a puppet State  which would give its allegiance to Tripoli.45.	At this very moment when I am addressing the Assembly  the uranium-rich region of Aozou is being ruled with an iron rod by the Libyan army and police. The Libyan authorities have established there the various branches of their administration  while an air base is being built with the help of foreign technicians.46.	This new phenomenon in relations between neighbouring States is taking place at a time when independence and open co-operation should encourage rapprochement between the peoples of Chad and Libya  who have been living in brotherhood and harmony for thousands of years. Our people  who have shared the same destiny in the past and are today facing the same tasks in fighting against the enemies of Africa  should understand each other  come together and unite their efforts for their better future.47.	The most serious thing is that this aggression and interference by Libya  supported and encouraged by certain Powers in the form of military aid  seriously threaten peace and security in our region  cause needless loss of human lives  and obstruct our economic and social development. We believe that in behaving as they do  sparing no thought for a peaceful country such as Chad  these Powers are assuming a grave international responsibility. We then ask ourselves why it is that here they preach detente  disarmament and the elimination of conflicts  when elsewhere they are creating hotbeds of war. As for Libya  does it believe it can start a revolution by interfering in the internal affairs of its neighbour or by squandering petrodollars which could be used for the benefit of its own people.48.	For its part  the Supreme Military Council  the highest body in the Chad nation  has  since the events of 13 April 1975  consistently advocated dialogue as the method for settling disputes with neighbouring and friendly countries  in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity. I therefore feel that I ought to inform this Assembly of the various attempts which the Council has made to secure the restoration of the rights of the Chad people.49.	In 1971  rumours were circulating at N'Djamena concerning the Libyan military presence in the northern part of the country. While for political reasons—which still  remain to be made clear-the then Government of Chad thought that it need not immediately denounce this serious situation  it nevertheless remains true that some patriots attempted to do so as early as 1972 because they felt that a blow was being struck against Chad's independence and sovereignty. In 1973  Libya installed itself at Aozou without further ado  invoking the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935  the so-called Mussolini-Laval Agreement. Now  that agreement never met the full requirements of existing international law and was even denounced by Italy and France.50.	Thus  true to the line of conduct laid down by the Supreme Military Council  the leaders of Chad have sent several missions to Tripoli  with a view to a friendly settlement of the problem of the occupation of the Aozou strip  and the aid which Libya has been giving to the opponents of the regime.51.	The most recent mission to Tripoli was led by the Vice-President of the Supreme Military Council. The mission failed because of Libya's claim that Aozou formed a part of southern Libya under the Mussolini-Laval Agreement and on the basis of lines traced on some maps. It was  however  agreed that the two parties should meet again at N'Djamena  as early as possible  in a technical commission  to discuss the border problem. The meeting  which was postponed several times  took place on 23 June 1977 at N'Djamena.52.	This new meeting again failed  since the Libyan representatives insisted on speaking rather of the implementation of the agreements concluded between our two countries in the economic  trade  cultural and technical fields. According to them  the frontier problem was a political one and had no place in a technical discussion. Nevertheless they indicated in this connexion that  in their view  the Mussolini-Laval Agreement still remained valid and even said that the Treaty signed between France and Libya in 1955  which recalled all the agreements and conventions on the present frontiers of Chad  in no way bound their country. That Treaty  ""full of hypocrisy  with confused articles""-to use their own words-had apparently been signed by a non-independent Libya because of the American and British presence on its territory and the French colonial presence in Chad. In their view too  Libya's desire would be ""to triumph over colonialism  which had created ideological and psychological separation between the north and the south and between the blacks and the other races of the continent by drawing up artificial frontiers which in no way corresponded to reality  to customs  or to races"".53.	But to our horror  at the very moment when the Chad and Libyan delegations were beginning these talks  unprecedented attacks instigated by Libya were launched by the rebels against the Chad military posts of Ounianga- Kebir  Zouar and Bardai'  situated in areas close to Aozou  with heavy arms weapons and rockets causing many deaths and casualties. The clear aim of these attacks was to influence the course of those talks.54.	As we have seen  all the negotiations between Chad and Libya have failed. The Chad Government therefore thought it appropriate to bring this matter before the OAU at the time of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government  -which was held at Libreville  Gabon  at the beginning of last July. President Malloum there stated Chad's position without any ambiguity. After having listened carefully to the parties concerned  the Heads of State and Government unanimously decided to set up a six-member committee of mediation and arbitration charged with finding a solution to the problem and reporting back to the Assembly. Thus the Committee  which met at Libreville on 10 August 1977  adopted a recommendation creating a sub-Committee of experts to study the frontier problem in all its aspects and to report back to it as quickly as possible.55.	Now  it should be noted that the former colonial Power  France  stated on 3 August 1977  after a meeting between President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and General Joseph Garba  Commissioner for External Affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  specifically on the frontier dispute between Chad and Libya  that ""the only frontier of Chad recognized by France  by virtue of the responsibilities that it exercised there  is the frontier which marked the boundaries of territory of Chad at the time of its independence on 11 August 1960"". By this statement Paris stated by implication that it did not recognize the occupation since 1973 of the Aozou Strip in the north of Chad by the forces of Tripoli.56.	I reaffirm that the people of Chad are asking only for recognition of its independence and sovereignty  the inviolability of its territory and non-interference in its internal affairs.•57.	Thus  faced with the Libyan threat  which is becoming increasingly serious  the masses of the people held enormous demonstrations throughout the country from the month of July on  to demand from the Government that the Aozou Strip be immediately restored.58.	The Government of Chad hopes  however  that a just and peaceful settlement is still possible  since the problem has been laid before the OAU in clear terms. We have full confidence in the wisdom of the African Heads of State or Government and we express the firm conviction that they will be able to find an urgent solution to the dispute between Chad and Libya.59.	The specific problem of Chad which I have just described has not caused me to lose sight of the topics which are a source of international concern.60.	At the present time southern Africa is going through a period of crisis  and we should make the necessary effort to find a just solution in favour of the Africans  who have been stripped of their rights by a white racist minority.61.	In Zimbabwe  all the plans aimed at permitting the transfer of power to the black majority have failed. We firmly support  on the one hand  the effort made by the leaders of the Patriotic Front as well as by the five front-line countries and  on the other  the recent Anglo- American plan for power to be transferred to the genuine representatives of the people of that country.62.	In South Africa  with the recent bloody events at Soweto  apartheid constitutes a true scourge which should be fought with the appropriate weapons. Many combatants have fallen in the struggle against apartheid. We pay a tribute to all those who  like Steven Biko  have fallen in the cause of justice  freedom and peace.63.	Independence must be granted to Namibia without any conditions. The extremely clear situation of this country has been lost sight of because of the egotistical designs of certain States.64.	It was through the complicity of the great Powers that a territory in Palestine was granted to Israel. For 30 years now the United Nations and  in particular  the Security Council have been considering the problems of this part of the world. We believe that the principles for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East contained in Security Council resolution 242(1967) remain the basis for any negotiation. However  we think that that resolution should be supplemented to take into account the legitimate claims of the Palestinians  in particular concerning their return to their homeland and their recovery of the property stolen from them.65.	We vigorously condemn the Israeli practices in the occupied Arab territories. The expansionist policy of Israel is a flagrant violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions-in particular the Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War-and the principles of non-transfer and non-immigration of the nationals of the occupying country to the occupied territory and respect  for the laws and regulations governing the territory before its occupation.66.	In our opinion  it is essential to reach a final settlement of this problem. Thus  there would be benefit to be derived from working for the early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  in which all the parties concerned would take part  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.67.	Chad cannot fail to express its indignation at the ceaselessly renewed designs on Mayotte  Cyprus and East Timor.68.	Mayotte should once more be included in the Comorian nation  of which it is an integral part.69.	The independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus should be respected.70.	With regard to East Timor  like the other former colonies  it should attain sovereignty.71.	Disarmament is a problem which concerns the survival of mankind. The world community is seeking international peace and security  and we are convinced that they can only be attained by means of general and complete disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament under international control.72.	The delegation of Chad cannot fail to stress its disappointment at the failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and to express its disapproval of the negative attitude of the developed countries at the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly.73.	Indeed  after 18 months of discussion at Paris  we really wonder whether Governments  particularly those of the industrialized countries  have genuinely taken into account the economic problems that arise at the international level  although they have recognized that interdependence is a reality and that solutions can be found to issues only in an atmosphere of co-operation and compromise.74.	The lack of imagination and of political will to seek daring initiatives leads us to note these nationalist  even protectionist  attitudes and makes us think that the economic prospects for the future are grave  both for the developed countries and for the developing countries.75.	The stubbornness of the developed countries in protecting their privileges  as well as their refusal to give the necessary support with regard to the concerns of the disadvantaged peoples  are causing economic relations  which are already bad enough  to deteriorate still further.76.	This is a humanitarian question and we think it is unjust and abnormal that a tiny part of the world should live in abundance  while millions of men  women and children are reduced to poverty  unemployment  sickness and ignorance.77.	So as to avoid confrontation  the third world appeals to the international community and to the conscience of mankind to put an end to exploitation and poverty. Today more than ever before  international co-operation is necessary and the industrialized countries must reconsider their positions and take the opportunities which are offered us to ensure that the future will be better for everyone.78.	To enable the third world to satisfy its aspirations  it is necessary for it to receive just payment for its products; for its economies  harmed by inflation  to be rebuilt  and for it to enjoy relief from its debt and effective participation in the world economic process  particularly in the monetary field.79.	As my delegation has repeatedly done from this very rostrum  we again appeal to the rich countries to show greater understanding in alleviating the disastrous economic situation of the third world.80.	Mr. President  in conclusion  I should like to discharge a pleasant duty  that of offering you  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.81.	I should also like to say how grateful we are to Mr Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe. Because of his impartiality  objectivity and understanding  he was able to direct the work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly in an outstanding manner.82.	To Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our eminent and tireless Secretary-General  who devotes himself daily to the cause of peace in the world and  particularly  in Africa  I wish to express the gratitude of the Republic of Chad.83.	My country's delegation welcomes the admission to membership in the world Organization of the sister Republic of Djibouti  a State whose accession to independence demonstrates once again that the process leading to the complete elimination of all the vestiges of colonialism in the world which has already begun cannot be stopped. We appeal to the conscience of all States  in particular to that of Djibouti's immediate neighbours  to respect its independence and territorial integrity scrupulously and to give it friendly and disinterested assistance in consolidating its economy.84.	Finally  we welcome the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which has just taken up its rightful place in our Organization. The admission of that country to the United Nations is both a victory for the Vietnamese people and a just application of the principle of universality of the United Nations. "
"125",6727,"TGO",32,1977,"﻿255.	 Our world is falling apart! In the chaotic convulsion of repeated crises  in the sudden outbursts of latent rivalries  in the deadly degeneration of deep-rooted antagonisms  a world made precarious by our impotence which rejects our thirst for new designs-a world rent with stubborn contradictions and acute dissatisfactions  alternately atopical and atypical—is exploding into ruins. Never before has the cry uttered a few years ago by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe   Our world is falling apart!   so relevant. A world is falling apart-a world which we must none the less rebuild based on the measures of new data and new principles.256.	.Once again we are assembled here in this Areopagus  the destiny of peoples as our horizon  and with the spurring of our consciences as our guiding hope in the face of the tremendous task awaiting us-the hope of undertaking the great change  of surveying new truths and of attaining virtue.257.	But may I first of all  before continuing my line of thought  discharge the agreeable duty of conveying to the President the warm congratulations of the Togolese delegation upon the unanimous confidence which has just been placed in him by his election to preside over the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly.258.	He belongs to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  a country which we hold in the highest esteem for having achieved that subtle mixture of accelerated but authentic development and an ever outward-looking policy through the promotion of the principles of non-alignment  peace and solidarity among peoples.259.	Steeped in these precepts which live in perfect symbiosis with the general principles of our Charter  and as an enlightened disciple of the school which has made a success of this kind of  marriage of character and worth   he has acquired well-tried competence which has inspired both respect and esteem. Hence we do not entertain even the slightest shadow of a doubt as to the way in which he will conduct our proceedings or as to their eventual success.260.	I cannot fail to mention the outgoing President  Mr. Amerasinghe  to whom I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute for his constant readiness to serve the sacred causes of. our Organization  and for his equally constant concern about easing  by his exemplary determination  the tragedies and crises afflicting our upside-down world  thus giving our Organization a new lease of tranquillity  greater vigor and an extra element of spirit.261.	My warm congratulations go also to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose renewed term of office permits him to preside once again over the destiny of the United Nations. The re-election of the Secretary-General  the apostle of peace  the ardent champion of oppressed peoples and just causes  amply demonstrates how judiciously we were inspired in voting for him. In offering him our best wishes for success  we hope that his second term of office will be an opportunity for him to give further vent to his creative imagination in the attainment of even more striking successes for the benefit of the international community as a whole.262.	Welcoming to the United Nations new Members always gives rise to intense emotion  though often restrained. I should like to make ours manifest by greeting whole-heartedly the Republic of Djibouti  whose presence among us is the happy outcome of a long process of decolonization. We welcome also Viet Nam  whose valiant people  rejecting subjugation in all its forms  has earned its place among us at the cost of much suffering and hardship  struggle and victory  which in the end made it free and made it great. The admission as a full-fledged Member of the United Nations of this country which has known consummate success and exemplary misfortune is an act of reason which gives practical effect to one of the fundamental principles of our Charter  the principle of universality.263.	There can be no doubt that these new States will bring to us the freshness of their generosity  the warmth of their feelings and the ardour of their convictions so as to galvanize a community which is in the grip of its spectres of disenchantment and disillusion.264.	I have spoken of virtue  and this is indeed the issue-virtue for a world on the look-out for other certainties  a world concerned to reduce  barbarism with a human face   which today is an indelible feature of it  in order to succeed through the raging tide of various conflicts to overcome the recurrent bouts of fever  to attain finally the human being. It is perhaps what is described by a word that is singularly worn out  an idea which is gently evaporating and becoming ephemeral—the new international order.265.	The world which is questioning itself and seeking itself  because it is leaking at all seams  this world of which a thinker recently said that it was  a disaster of which man is the culmination   is today going through currents that are contradictory because they are clearly antithetical.266.	On the one hand  those who find in it their ends by any means available  forgetful of the fundamental precept which is that  the means are the incipient end and the ideal about to be brought about  are guided by iniquity and fulfil themselves by hatred. On the political level  they have forged blunt instruments of discrimination  domination and subjection. On the economic level  they trample upon the ideals of justice  solidarity and fraternity for the benefit of the pursuit of their uneven short-sighted interests. To the problems of our time they wish to apply their therapy: to apply a plaster cast to a wooden leg.267.	On the other hand are those who have the task of resisting the new heights of unreason  of deciphering the secret language of. the future by lucid reflection on aims and objectives  a crystal-clear definition of a society for tomorrow and voluntary action to guide the course of events towards the great inversion.268.	In the face of these positions in the form of challenges  there remains a clear responsibility of the international community. Endorsed by the basic principles of our Charter' strengthened by the growing outcry of men all over the world who have made themselves the apostles of elementary rights for human beings and call with all their strength for the triumph of a  society for all  the international community must step up its efforts to master the evolution and impose everywhere the advent of the sacred principles which enlighten and guide us.269.	First of all it must do so in the field of human rights and decolonization. Here we are on the very threshold of the  kingdom of the shadows . Here  again  the spectacle is one of horror. The progress recorded  the effort made by the international community  should not make us forget that no bargaining is permitted here  no compromises are tolerated  no detour is permissible. We are dealing here with the liberty of peoples. Situations do have particular feat area  but the underlying reality is always the same everywhere: That is  overwhelming oppression on the part of a group that is invariably in the minority  a group which is entrenched in power through cunning complicities  loud of speech and quick to act  forgetful of all rules and scornful of all rights. The result is always a remarkable equipollence. Those who have worn out their vision because they have seen too much horror we now see on their feet  with weapons in their hands  rejecting their status  a status in which man becomes a creature obeying another creature who imposes his will. Now violence is gaining the upper hand and is becoming established. Violence is sharpening insatiably its cannibalistic teeth for the distant future. Thus it is in South Africa  in Namibia  in Zimbabwe and also in the Middle East.270.	In southern Africa  we must above all greet the efforts made to seek acceptable solutions. We must encourage them. After all  the longest journey must begin with a first step.271.	However  in duty to the truth  we must also say that nothing useful will be done in Zimbabwe if Ian Smith continues to prevaricate  cherishing stubborn illusions that he can use certain dissident elements in the liberation movements in order to bring about a so-called internal solution to the detriment of the militants of the Patriotic Front. Without doubt the Patriotic Front itself  overcoming its reluctance  should open itself up to all trends  to all the sons of Zimbabwe fighting and suffering  as suggested by the Conference of the Heads of State and Government of OAU in Libreville in July. But it remains nevertheless clear that the manoeuvres and masquerades of the Salisbury rebel mislead no one  and the time is at hand when we shall see him repent.272.	Similarly  nothing useful will be accomplished in Namibia if resolution 385 (1976) of the Security  Council is not applied fully  if the impenitent Vorster does not cease to defy the whole international community with his acts of proven provocation like the appointment of a General Administrator in Namibia or the shameless claim to Walvis Bay. In any case  in regard to this last point  Walvis Bay is Namibian and Walvis Bay will remain Namibian.273.	Now  in South Africa the supporters of apartheid continue cynically to flout the most elementary human rights. Let us beware here of any kind of Pontius Pilate attitude  which would be short-sighted  and let us by no means share the assertion that hell is other people. In the face of this regime of fact and of force which is on its way to becoming a nuclear Power  let us shed our garb of indifference to eradicate once and for all the horror of the African continent and collaborate in the advent of the majority regime  one of liberty and justice.274.	In this regard  we cannot but be gratified at the unprecedented success of the United Nations International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo  and the Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid. We hope for the wholehearted implementation by the international community of the recommendations adopted there to alleviate the sufferings of those who live in the shadow of death  segregated in the kraals of misery.275.	Contempt for fundamental human rights comes together with a classic type of colonial situation in the Middle East. The problem of Palestine and of the occupied Arab territories has taken a serious turn with the coming to power of a new administration in Israel. The intransigence of Israel  its obstinate refusal to free the occupied Arab territories in accordance with United Nations resolutions  its drive to power which prompts it to create settlements on the West Bank  continue to pose-a threat of imminent war in that region.276.	The Government of General of the Army Gnassingbe Eyadema is convinced that any solution to the crisis must necessarily be brought about through recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and its right to a homeland. Therefore it is urgent for the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to resume  with the effective participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on the basis of acceptable arrangements  and that there should be an immediate implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council relating to this subject.277.	We trust that the Israeli Government will associate itself with the efforts of goodwill undertaken by certain States and by our Organization itself to bring about a happy ending to the crisis and to establish just and lasting peace in that area which has been so sorely tried.278.	But here and there  there remain other sources of tension where delicate situations of conflict are of concern to men of goodwill.279.	In Cyprus  in the Comorian island of Mayotte  in Lebanon  there is still hope  however  that the international community will be able to control the causes of explosion and conflict  in the interests of peace  of a universal and profound peace.280.	The same applies in Korea where the reunification of the country  which has had such a distressing past  must come about once all foreign troops have been withdrawn and a lasting peace agreement has been concluded.281.	The fact remains that the international community  in its efforts to limit conflicts  has come up against the anguishing problem of the proliferation of arms of all kinds.282.	In this regard  it is our profound conviction that peace  if it is to be lasting  must be based upon judiciously managed disarmament This disarmament should embrace the immediate cessation of all nuclear tests and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction  while making it possible for all to have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We therefore unswervingly support the World Disarmament Conference  the primary task of which will be to adopt a coherent programme in the hope that all or part of the $350 billion at present devoted throughout the world to armaments will be devoted to the development effort.283.	Thus  humanity is at the cross-roads. A profound undercurrent is being felt drawing us towards liberty  equality and fraternity  freedom for the peoples  and the safeguarding of their fundamental rights. The international community  while preventing the rearguard action of those who want to undermine this process  must define the lofty designs that it has in mind and contemplate broader horizons.284.	It must struggle together with all those who believe that when political liberty is restored this must mean liberty for the humblest people and respect for their fundamental rights.285.	But it must also guarantee to its members the satisfaction of a need that is just as important: the need for equality  so that we may fulfil the moral requirement of greater justice in the distribution not only of goods but also the power of decision.286.	In this regard  freedom in the economic sense will only be the prelude to or the consequence of a fruitful cultural emancipation within the framework of the indispensable interchange of civilizations.287.	But here  as elsewhere  there is resistance.288.	To speak of the economic field: the new international economic order has become a subject of discussion. Those who advocate the kind of therapy of putting plaster casts on wooden legs are legion. Plans for stabilization and overcoming stagnation and governmental programmes aimed at ensuring a resumption of production and the establishment of essential balances simply aim at- reorganizing the old order.289.	We reflect  we ponder  we try to reduce the ill effects and we come back to the attractions of subtle applications of budgetary policy and monetary policy. The ultimate aim is for each of the nations to safeguard the advantages it has to avoid social problems and domestic tragedies. Who could be surprised  therefore  at the recrudescence of the old protectionist demons? As they weather the crisis and prepare for the unforeseeable  governments feel a deep nostalgia for the old expansionism. Is not their desire to return to a golden age that is all the more attractive because it is over and done with?290.	Thus  the North-South dialogue  instead of unifying diverse aspirations into an integrated whole  has curiously resulted only in empty words and unrelated monologues.291.	That is why  in spite of certain positive signs emerging from the talks which have been held recently  the contradictions between the two groups of countries grow ceaselessly more acute  and the essential still remains to be done.292.	The North refuses to endorse Aristotle's belief that wealth resided far more in use than in possession.293.	It also disregards these wise words of Mahatma Gandhi: Civilization perhaps does not mean the multiplication of needs  but rather the conscious and voluntary restraint of those needs. To wish to create an unlimited number of needs in order to have  subsequently  to satisfy them is to pursue the wind. 294.	The fact is that the North wants to preserve  as long as possible  its acquired privileges. Unguibus et rostro  tooth and nail  it is defending its advantages and is shoring up its positions. The aim surely is to plaster over the old order  where those at the centre prosper to the detriment of those on the periphery. There is no question of re-forging the whole system in order to bring about a collective development which will be coherent and harmonious.295.	It is easy  therefore  to understand the reasons why the North-South Conference was unable to overcome the difficulties  to transcend the contradictions and to fulfil the hopes which it had aroused at the beginning. The last session of our Assembly forthrightly admitted as much.296.	Of course  there were results  we must admit  if not in the field of energy  at least in so far as concerns primary commodities  trade and development assistance.297.	But we are left with the weighty handicap of the 21 points on which no agreement was reached; there remains the fundamental problem of the indebtedness of third- world countries. There also remain the endless debates on the common fund for the stabilization of primary commodities. On the strength of the experience of the Lome Convention  some people are tending towards a generalization of the system of the stabilization of export earnings; others are aiming higher  and are not only seeking guarantees of income stabilization but also optimistically contemplating even more far-reaching plans.298.	In view of these steps  the third world is clearly defining its positions: it calls for effective growth for all within the framework of a new organization of the world economic system  with  as elements of this system  the effective stabilization of earnings; better management and dissemination of technology; and the settlement of the problem of indebtedness in a way which would take account of the interests of all-and I repeat   all -of the countries of the Group of 77.299.	Economic revival and policies of reinvigoration in the northern countries and their success would merely mean the immediate re-emergence of selfishness  the suave mari magno  while the payments deficits of the third world pose and will continue to pose ever more inextricable problems of balance and financing. In this regard the new  Witteveen facilities  of $10 billion  handled by IMF  are an important step forward. 300.	But the third world is getting organized. The Arab- African dialogue  which culminated in Cairo at the beginning of this year  is the most striking example of this. Thus in Africa and elsewhere we have witnessed the birth of regional economic unions  which are the touchstones of collective self-reliance and horizontal co-operation. The progress of the Economic Community of West African States is further proof of this.301.	 Reach for your ideal a thousand times and if you fail a thousand times  try once again.  That is the thinking of a contemporary sage.302.	In a world which has now been cast adrift  where confusion has overwhelmed our minds and hearts  this ideal may seem somewhat obscured. But it is needful for all because of its blinding simplicity. It can be summed up in these three words: justice  peace  solidarity.303.	Beyond the abstruse debates and the rigid positions  there remains an absolute need to ensure justice by making the application of human rights general and by bringing about the general liberation of all those who were  born free but [are] everywhere in chains . This is the condition for peace. This peace must be accompanied by an active solidarity which will guarantee mankind collective advancement  with respect for different cultures and the indispensable interchange between them.304.	The world which is breaking apart is a world of contempt for the culture of other people and for their intrinsic values. Now that reason has reached its limits and civilization is at bay  regeneration will come from the depths of the heart and the imagination.305.	Let us liberate  therefore  men who are today despised  who are demeaned and who are trodden under foot  because tomorrow they will help us to live. We still have time to live. "
"126",6773,"THA",32,1977,"﻿150.	Mr. President  allow me at the outset to offer my warmest congratulations to you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in your undertaking  and I should like to pledge my delegation's full co-operation in your performance of the duties entrusted to you by the world community.151.	I wish to pay a high tribute to Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka  a distinguished son of Asia  for the statesmanlike manner in which he presided over the thirty- first session of the General Assembly in the past year. We all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his tireless efforts and his sincere dedication to his task.152.	I wish also to extend a cordial welcome to the two new Members of the Organization  Djibouti and Viet Nam.The latter is a neighbour of ours  and we were pleased to be one of the sponsors of the resolution on its admission to the United Nations  Thailand looks forward to co-operating closely with both the new Members in the General Assembly and in other forums of the United Nations. My delegation is particularly heartened by the reiteration by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam [3rd meeting] of its policy of peace towards its South-East Asian neighbours  which augurs well for the peace and stability as well as the progress and prosperity of South-East Asia.153.	Now that all the countries of South-East Asia have been admitted as peace-loving Members of this Organization a unique opportunity offers itself for more productive pursuits and beneficial undertakings among countries of the region  regardless of differences in their political  economic or social systems.154.	The five Heads of Government of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  met recently in Kuala Lumpur  on 4 and 5 August 1977  to celebrate ASEAN tenth anniversary and to review the development and progress of the organization during its first decade. In assessing political developments affecting the ASEAN region the five Heads of Government reaffirmed their Governments' desire to develop peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with all countries in the region  including the three countries of Indo-China.155.	My Government is of the view that full efforts should be made to enhance the prospect of better understanding among all South-East Asian countries and that every avenue of peaceful and constructive co-operation should be explored on the basis of equality and mutuality of interests. Thailand has accordingly been encouraged by recent progress towards the establishment of an interim committee with Laos and Viet Nam on the United Nations-sponsored Lower Mekong Basin Project under the aegis of ESCAP. The reactivation of that scheme will pave the way for co-operation among the riparian States concerned. In this connexion  it is hoped that in due course Democratic Kampuchea will also resume its participation in that beneficial regional project. In this regard  Thailand has been actively engaged in that co-operative endeavour in order to help to improve the over-all political climate in the region.156.	It is regrettable that  although Thailand was the first among the ASEAN nations to re-establish diplomatic relations with Democratic Kampuchea at the end of 1975  border problems between the two countries have continued  resulting in much loss of life and damage to property. My Government had hoped that  given the desire to avoid bloodshed and sincere efforts on both sides to arrive at a good understanding with each other  the difficulties could be surmounted by diplomatic negotiations.157.	Unfortunately  the border situation has become worse. None the less  the Thai Government has made repeated efforts to hold talks with Democratic Kampuchea on border questions  as well as on other matters affecting the relations between our two countries  through the liaison officers appointed by the two Governments in November 1975. To our regret  our repeated attempts to make contact with the Cambodian liaison officer have been ignored. Moreover  our efforts to initiate a dialogue with Democratic Kampuchea in a few capital cities where both Governments are represented have thus far been unsuccessful. However  my Government is determined to continue in our quest to have the border problems with Democratic Kampuchea settled peacefully in accordance with our basic policy of peaceful coexistence with all our neighbours. My delegation wishes to reiterate here that Thailand entertains no aggressive design against any of its neighbours  including Democratic Kampuchea  nor has it any ambition for territorial gain from them. In respect of Democratic Kampuchea  Thailand still strictly abides by the joint communiqué of 31 October 1975 between the two countries.158.	My delegation listened with interest to the statement of the Chairman of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic of 3 October 1977 in this same hail. Since Thailand consistently advocates and maintains its policy of reciprocal friendship with all its neighbours—and indeed with all countries—irrespective of differences in political  economic or social systems and on the basis of both mutual respect of each other's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs  it is patently clear  therefore  that the Lao statement referring to Thailand's policy as being ""unfriendly"" is not born out by the facts. In respect of Laos  the Thai people and the Lao people share close ethnic and cultural affinities which have  through the centuries  cemented the bonds of friendship between them and will  I feel sure  contribute to the attainment of Thailand's worthy objectives—namely  to live in peace  brotherhood and close  neighbourly co-operation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic. For its part  the Royal Thai Government will continue its endeavour to improve Thai-Lao relations in accordance with the joint communiqué of 3 August 1976 between the two countries.159.	As regards another of Thailand's neighbours  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  my Government will continue to abide by the Thai-Vietnamese joint communiqué of 6 August 1976  which enumerates four principles for the promotion of better relations between the two countries. It is hoped that  in the. not-too-distant future  an exchange of ambassadors will be effected  as envisaged by the said communiqué. It is accordingly gratifying that both sides have shown a willingness to hold discussions on bilateral issues  which Thailand hopes will bring about good-neighbourly understanding  as well as regional stability and harmony.160.	My delegation believes that the United Nations continues to provide the only truly world-wide forum for all of us to put our minds together in the common search for global solutions to global problems. And even if solutions adopted in the past have sometimes fallen short of public expectations  international debates in the United Nations have generated world-wide interest in global problems and have prepared a climate of opinion favourable to their solution and evolved guidelines for future remedial international action.161.	The above is certainly true of the disarmament discussions held in recent years  which have yielded little in the way of tangible results. The arms race among the major Powers still continues at an alarming rate  and such developments as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the search for detente between the two super-Powers have yet to make a discernible impact on the world disarmament situation. However  we must persevere in our pursuit of disarmament and arms control  particularly in nuclear and thermonuclear weapons  so that the scarce resources now being wasted in the manufacture of increasingly sophisticated weapons of mass destruction can be diverted to peaceful development projects for the benefit of all peoples. My Government accordingly welcomes the initiative to hold a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in May and June 1978. However  thorough preparations by the Conference on the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva and in other forums will be necessary to ensure the success of that special session.162.	In the Middle East  though the United Nations peace-keeping presence has been extended until 1978 by agreements with the States concerned and the cease-fire remains in effect  the situation there is highly volatile on account of the continued occupation of Arab territories seized during the 1967 war and the establishment of Israeli settlements in those territories in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. It is the view of my delegation that all parties involved should work together towards an amicable and lasting settlement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and on principles which will enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate right of self-determination and return to their homeland  while at the same time assuring Israel of its sovereign independence and security as a State. Meanwhile  none of the parties involved should make a unilateral move which would jeopardize the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East and its successful outcome. In the light of the foregoing  my delegation welcomes the Soviet- American statement on the Middle East of 1 October 1977  which indicates the seriousness of the efforts on the part of the two Co-Chairmen to reconvene the Geneva Conference by the end of this year.163.	The question of Cyprus  which has remained for a long time on the agenda of this Assembly  continues unsolved. Despite the tireless efforts of the Secretary- General and his Special Representative in Cyprus  the negotiations between the representatives of the two Cypriot communities held in Vienna in late March this year ended inconclusively. The continuing presence of the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force there has helped to maintain a precarious peace on the island. My delegation hopes that  with the resumption of the intercommunal talks  a solution acceptable to both sides could be reached which would preserve intact the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. In the meantime  no action should be taken that would tend to decrease the prospects of such a settlement.164.	The human rights issue  now being given added prominence by some world leaders  has become a highly sensitive issue  especially since sharp divergences exist concerning the definition of that term and the extent of its applicator in actual practice. While there exists the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights as the only instrument agreed to be most Member States  the industrialized nations tend to stress the political and civil liberties contained in the first half of the Declaration  but the developing countries tend to point to the wide-ranging economic and social rights contained in the second half of the Declaration.165.	However  the principal thrust of the reawakened interest in humanitarian affairs is in a direction that will strengthen the moral fibre of the world community to the benefit of individuals at large. My Government welcomes such efforts  for the principles concerning human rights are based on the most noble of ideas. In this respect  my delegation agrees with the Secretary-General  who states in his report on the work of the Organization:""The basic aim of United Nations actions in this field is not to accuse or to provoke acrimonious debate  but to develop a common consciousness in the international community and to encourage improvement in respect for individual dignity and fundamental freedoms"". It is also the view of my delegation  however  that for advocator of human rights to be credible there must be only one standard for judging whether or not basic human rights are violated  and that the criteria employed must be the same in all cases and not be selectively applied. Furthermore  multilateralization of the issue  on the basis of objective and non-discriminating criteria  will tend to avoid possible exacerbation of bilateral conflicts.166.	In Thailand a humanitarian tradition has existed from time immemorial. The present Government is conscious of the need to ensure the basic human rights and requirements of all its citizens. Accordingly  it has carried out such essential projects is land reform and integrated rural development  which have received wide popular support. It has also succeeded in maintaining law and order and in restoring public confidence in honest government. Such efforts to ensure basic human rights and needs for our people would be futile without the security and stability that form the bedrock of economic development and national progress.167.	We in Thailand have a humanitarian tradition in respect not only of our own people but also of others. That is why  out- of our own humanitarian feelings  we have allowed over 130 000 Indo-Chinese displaced persons to enter Thailand and have provided them with temporary relief in the form of shelter  food and medical care. This has imposed a heavy financial and administrative burden on my country as well as a security problem. As the influx grew and related problems increased  the Thai Government  already preoccupied with the task of assisting a large number of displaced persons who had come to Thailand in the wake of the 1945 Franco-Indo-Chinese conflict  sought and obtained international assistance  mainly from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  as well as from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other voluntary agencies.168.	Responding to the Thai Government's appeal  the Office of The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees extended prompt assistance by means of large- scale relief in co-operation with the Thai Government and various other countries  international organizations and voluntary agencies. After the first agreement of December 1975 had expired  my Government and the High Commissioner concluded a new agreement on 22 July of this year on the basis of the latest appeal in which the High Commissioner has set the target of $12.35 million for further relief efforts. I should like  therefore  to take this opportunity to place on record my Government's gratitude and appreciation to the High Commissioner for his effective response and continued support  as well as to his dedicated representative and staff for their invaluable work in Thailand. The World Food Programme  which has given food aid to the displaced persons  and other organizations such as the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration and the International Committee of the Red Cross  as well as the many religious and voluntary agencies involved  also deserve our grateful appreciation for their assistance.169.	It is hoped that the other United Nations specialized agencies and bodies concerned will be urged by this General Assembly to render the fullest support to the High Commissioner in providing the necessary assistance to these displaced persons  whose plight constitutes .an urgent international humanitarian problem.170.	I should also like to express my Government's sincere appreciation to those countries which have not only contributed to but have further increased their support for the current relief assistance programme in Thailand  including those countries which continue to accept a significant number of the displaced persons for resettlement  thereby enabling them to begin new lives. We earnestly hope that those countries  as well as others in a position to do so  will translate their humanitarian concerns into concrete actions to help to alleviate the plight of people who are much less fortunate than their own.171.	Another major problem that gravely affects the public health  welfare and quality of life of the world population is the problem of narcotic drugs.172.	The Thai Government is deeply concerned at the growth in drug abuse and drug addiction now taking place in many parts of the world. For a number of years now  it has been generally agreed that this problem calls for urgent steps by the world community to eliminate the production  trafficking and smuggling of illicit narcotics and to control the spread of addiction. But today all these goals remain elusive.173.	My Government is currently making every possible effort to suppress trafficking through our territory in co-operation with the law enforcement agencies of interested Governments as well as with the United Nations. These crack-downs on drug traffickers h* e so far produced encouraging results. We are  at the same time  vigorously promoting an educational campaign against illicit drugs throughout the country.174.	Early this year  the present Thai Government established a. new office  the Narcotics Control Board  to improve the co-ordination of the efforts and arrangements of Government agencies entrusted with the various tasks involved in suppressing drug abuse and trafficking. Efforts to persuade hill tribes to cease growing the opium poppy in the northern border areas have made substantial progress under the joint United Nations-Thai Programme for Drug Abuse Control. Although we have encountered many difficulties in obtaining accessible markets with fair prices for substitute crops  Thailand is determined to proceed with the current project.175.	I should like to reaffirm my Government's commitment to bilateral  regional and multilateral co-operation in the campaign against drug abuse and against the drug traffic. Each and every nation should do its utmost to contribute  in a spirit of co-operation  to the combined efforts being made within and outside the United Nations framework  until our common objective of eradicating this evil from the world and of achieving freedom from drug abuse is realized.176.	Discrimination against a person on racial grounds constitutes a violation of basic human rights. The Thai policy on this matter is clear and unequivocal. Racism and racial discrimination in any form or guise  including apartheid  are abhorrent to the Thai Government and people. The policy of apartheid as practised in South Africa is offensive to human dignity and contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. My Government took part in the World Conference for Action against Apartheid held in Lagos last August and joined with other participants in demonstrating the serious concern of the international community over the inhumane policy of apartheid. My delegation wishes to reiterate once again its whole-hearted support for and solidarity with all those who are currently striving to eliminate apartheid and racial discrimination from Africa and the rest of the world.177.	The problems of southern Africa have today become the centre of the attention of the international community as never before. The United Nations has played a crucial role in informing us of the plight of the people in Zimbabwe and Namibia. The International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held at Maputo in May"" this year  highlighted the grave problems existing there and reminded each of us of our obligation to work for an early end to minority rule and the inhumane policy of racial segregation.178.	It is tragic that in Zimbabwe the illegal minority regime continues to be intransigent and has stepped up the campaign of. brutal repression against the people of Zimbabwe. Thailand joins the overwhelming majority of Member States in extending support to the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle to achieve independence based on the principle of majority rule achieved through the system of ""one man  one vote"".179.	My delegation associates itself fully with the efforts of the United Nations to put an end to South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. Free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations should be held as soon as possible for the whole of Namibia  as one political entity  in accordance with Security Council resolution 385 (1976). The Namibian people  with SWAPO acting as their spearhead  must be allowed to attain self-determination and independence within a united Namibia  and we deplore any deceitful action on the part ofSouth Africa to perpetuate its colonial exploitation of the Namibian people and further obstruct their progress towards independence. My delegation hopes  however  that the present joint diplomatic efforts by the United Kingdom and the United States will help to persuade the leaders of the two regimes concerned to be less intransigent  so that progress towards full independence for both Namibia and Zimbabwe may be hastened and further bloodshed avoided.180.	The international economic system created after the Second World War has proved to be inadequate in view of the changing patterns of economic growth and the increasing interdependence of nations. Many developed and developing countries have thus concluded that there is a real need for a major overhaul of the existing international economic system. This process of negotiation to create the new international economic order is already under way in a variety of forums  both within and outside the United Nations  where developing nations have been seeking a greater role in global economic decision-making. The new international economic order represents the only hope for the future of the developing nations because it aims essentially at redressing for the good of all the imbalances which have for too long existed in the relationship between the rich and the poor nations. What we as a member of the community of developing nations aspire to is the institutionalisation of measures that will ensure: first  the stabilization of the prices of primary commodities especially relative to manufactured products; secondly  an increase in the share of the developing countries in world exports of manufactured goods; thirdly  a larger flow of development assistance in real terms; fourthly  an increase in capital investment in areas most relevant to the domestic economic needs of the developing nations; and fifthly  a decrease in the dependence of the developing countries on imports of manufactured goods.181.	As a producer and exporter of primary commodities Thailand also shares the desire of the developing countries  as manifested in the various forums of negotiations  that commitments should be forthcoming from the industrialized countries to import from them increased quantities of commodities in all forms. Furthermore  constraints on trade arising from tariff and non-tariff barriers in developed countries should be reduced or  better still  eliminated.182.	The crucial weakness in the present mechanism of international trade which is of immediate interest to Thailand and other developing countries has been the instability of the prices of primary commodities. Price fluctuations militate against a stable rate of economic growth by their effects on export earnings. The importance of this problem cannot be overstated for most of us in the developing world. As an illustration  the 18 commodities initially identified at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi as being of export interest primarily to the developing countries11 account for about one third of the total export earnings of Thailand. Any adverse price fluctuation in these commodities would have unfavourable effects on a developing economy such as ours. It is for this reason that Thailand welcomes the modest achievement of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  resulting in concrete steps leading to the establishment of a common fund aimed at improving the structure of international commodity markets  which are essential to the long-term growth and development of the developing countries.183.	The foregoing remarks reflect not only the views of Thailand but also those of our partners in ASEAN as embodied in the joint communiqué issued after the 2nd meeting early in August this year of the Heads of Government of the ASEAN countries in Kuala Lumpur. The concerns and the efforts of the ASEAN group of developing countries are thus identical with those which the developing countries as a whole have consistently expressed in the forums of the United Nations since the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.184.	The Conference on International Economic Cooperation in Paris produced some positive results in reaching limited agreements in certain fields where follow- up negotiations between North and South are clearly needed. Nevertheless its over-all results fell short of agreed objectives  and no real progress was made towards the restructuring of the international economic system or the solution of the most pressing problems facing the developing countries today. It is to be regretted that during the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly  for want of time  no mutually satisfactory conclusion was reached regarding the assessment of the Paris Conference. But we must not lose hope. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation should now be placed in its proper perspective—as only one phase in the long process of the North-South dialogue. Since much valuable time has already been lost  both developed and developing nations should put their heads together and intensify their efforts within the United Nations system to review their respective positions on unresolved issues  especially those relating to the establishment of the new international economic order. The Thai delegation supports the proposal put forward by the Group of 77 during the resumed thirty-first session to convene a special session of the General Assembly at the ministerial level by early 1980 at the latest in order to assess the progress made in the various forums of the United Nations system in the establishment of the new international economic order.185.	As a food producing and exporting country  Thailand was honoured to be elected last year to the World Food Council. We also noted with satisfaction that some basic agreements were reached in regard to food and agriculture at the Paris Conference. There can be no doubt that solutions to the pressing world food problems  including malnutrition and the improvement of agriculture in developing countries  must be regarded as matters of primary concern and as the responsibility of the international community as a whole. Nor can it be overemphasized that there exists in the developing countries a vital link between agriculture and food production on the one hand and rural development on the other and  hence  the long-term economic stability and growth of those countries. In this context  therefore  Thailand  which participated in the third ministerial session of the World Food Council in Manila in June this year  wishes to express once again its full support for the decisions emanating from that session aimed primarily at increasing world food production to help alleviate the problem of food shortage in the world.186.	With regard to food aid policies and programmes  however  Thailand wishes to express again its concern that care must be taken to avoid disincentives not only to production in recipient countries but also to food-exporting developing countries. We fully endorse the principle of the triangular transaction in any programme of food aid and urge that such a principle be applied  to the maximum extent possible  by the donor countries and agencies.187.	My delegation wishes to express its gratification that the target of SI billion has been achieved by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We wish to place on record our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the Executive Director of the World Food Council for their invaluable efforts to bring the Fund into being. The early commencement of the operations of the Fund is clearly fundamental to the solution of the world's food problems.188.	The year 1976 was a critical one for both UNDP and its partners in the sense that  apart from being the last year of the first programming cycle  it was also the year in which UNDP  as the financing agency of the United Nations on a broad range of developmental activities  was beset with severe financial and administrative problems. There were some extremely difficult decisions which the Administrator had to make to restore confidence in this regard  and he took the necessary steps with dispatch  courage and farsightedness. Therefore  my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to him and to his colleagues in UNDP for the useful efforts they have so far made to overcome the difficulties facing them and to put UNDP once again on the right track.189.	The importance and usefulness of UNDP do not lie only in the fact that it embodies  on a global scale  the international commitment to pool resources and expertise in a vast variety of fields for the purpose of assisting the developing countries in their national and regional developmental needs; equally significant is its role as a catalyst and innovator in the employment of modern approaches and techniques to technical co-operation and developmental technology aimed at helping the developing countries acquire the capabilities they need for self-reliance  both individually and among themselves. It is thus that this United Nations body can truly serve the long-term needs of the majority of the world and in so doing transform itself into a truly valuable instrument for world economic and social advancement. As a member of the Governing Council of UNDP  Thailand will do all it can to strengthen such a role for UNDP and pledges its full support and co-operation in the common task of rendering UNDP even more useful and effective.190.	I wish to turn now to the role of ESCAP. On the occasion of the opening of the thirty-third session of ESCAP in Bangkok  my Prime Minister spoke of ESCAP's invaluable role not only as an honest broker between developed and developing countries in the region but also in the promotion of co-operation among the developing countries themselves. In this regard  my delegation wishes to note the significant progress made in both economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries. While the results of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  held at Mexico City in September 1976  were relatively inconclusive  a useful beginning was made which we hope will pave the way towards tangible accomplishments in this important field. With regard to technical co-operation among developing countries  I wish to reiterate here our appreciation for the positive efforts which ESCAP and the United Nations agencies concerned have made not only in the promotion of projects relating to technical co-operation among developing countries but  more importantly  in the promotion of the very concept of technical co-operation among developing countries  a concept crucial to the establishment of the new international economic order.191.	International agreement on the law of the sea has long been overdue. Although certain progress has been made during the sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  there still remain many fundamental issues to be further negotiated at the next session in Geneva. One example of substantive progress was the issuance of the informal composite negotiating text  which combined all the chapters in one single document. A high degree of political will and mutual trust must prevail if the next session of the Conference is to be successful; and my delegation wishes to appeal to all parties involved to strive even harder to arrive at an agreement on this highly important issue in the spirit of mutual accommodation.192.	The United Nations is-now 32 years old. During those years  the system and practices governing international relations have undergone profound changes and some of the key assumptions of recent decades no longer hold true. Some issues which have dominated world events are now receding  while new ones have become prominent on the international agenda. Interdependence has become the hallmark of international relations and the distinction between the political and the economic aspects of international affairs is being rapidly narrowed. The Organization  too  has changed. Not only have many new States been admitted to the Organization  but also  increasingly  varied matters are being subjected to international scrutiny  as witnessed by the current cycle of thematic conferences being held under the aegis of the United Nations.193.	In the face of these significant changes  all Member States should endeavour  through good sense and foresight  to find ways and means of making the United Nations more effective in meeting the new challenges.194.	Though the founders of the United Nations have proved unusually prescient and the instrumentalities they employed to reach and to implement decisions have proved remarkably adaptable  many aspects of the existing concepts  principles and machinery have become inadequate to cope with the ever-expanding requirements confronting the Organization. My delegation noted that the General Assembly  at its twenty-ninth session  established an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations. We also have before us recommendations of the 13 wise men concerning the restructuring of the United Nations  in particular the reorganization of the economic sector. All these recommendations should be studied seriously with a view to taking action to correct inadequacies and to improve our Organization further.195.	Above all  it must be recognized that one principal source of the world Organization's strength is that it expresses some of the deepest and most fundamental aspirations of mankind. It is this moral authority which constitutes a vital asset of the Organization. All Member States have therefore an interest in protecting and preserving the Organization's moral authority and in not dissipating it  for instance  by adopting inconsistent and contradictory resolutions  which only serve to compromise the authority and the effectiveness of the very instruments in which we place our hopes and abiding faith.196.	Finally  I should like to pay a warm and sincere tribute to our able and indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  upon whose shoulders falls the heavy task of heading this world Organization. For his industry and his dedication to the cause of peace  freedom  justice and human progress  he clearly earns and deserves our continued full support in the performance of his important and often very difficult and delicate tasks.197.	The well-being of nations and men are today irrevocably linked. Many common challenges are now facing us: how to solve existing political conflicts; to progress towards disarmament; to eliminate all vestiges of colonialism; to work towards achieving the new international economic order; to protect the global environment and to preserve existing non-renewable resources; and to ensure world-wide respect for human rights and social justice. Let us resolve to meet these challenges together  and let each resolve to fulfil his share of responsibility so as to make this planet Earth a better place in which to live for all mankind. "
"127",6890,"TTO",32,1977,"﻿1.	It gives me great pleasure and satisfaction to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and on my own behalf  congratulations and best wishes on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. My delegation pledges to you its full co-operation and is assured that the deliberations of the Assembly could not have been placed in more experienced and capable hands.2.	I should like at this point to express my appreciation and that of my delegation to Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka for the skill and tact which he  in his capacity as President  brought to bear on the conduct of affairs of the thirty-first session.3.	One of the guiding principles of the United Nations has been its essential universality. It has been the view of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that the acceptance of that principle is a sine qua non of international peace and security. It is a principle which contributes to the maintenance of the balance between sovereignty and national interest  cm the one hand  and international order and responsibility  on the other. The growth of this Organization is ample evidence  if that were needed  of the fact that there need not be conflict between the desire of States for freedom of action and the necessity for order and predictability in world affairs. It is in the context of that conviction that the Government of Trinidad and Tobago warmly welcomes the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti to membership in the United Nations.4.	Our esteemed Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization has made reference to global problems facing the international community— among them the arms race  the proliferation of nuclear weapons  population pressures  shortages and the inequitable distribution of food  chronic poverty  the control of marine resources  the question of energy  unemployment  commodity prices and instability  in the world financial markets.. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's view regarding the need for early action on those and other problems which face the international community.5.	Trinidad and Tobago notes the initiative of the Secretary-General in respect of his call for the establishment of a United Nations energy institute The Government of Trinidad and Tobago agrees that energy is one of the critical factors in the establishment of any new international economic order. My delegation interprets that call as one which it hopes will lead to the economic transformation of the economies of the developing countries-one that will change the position of third-world countries from that of perpetual dependence to self-reliance and partnership. For a small developing country like Trinidad and Tobago those are fundamental objectives.6.	Within the last decade we have witnessed a heightened awareness on the part of the international community of the urgent need to create a more just and equitable system of international economic relations. The economic crisis of 1973 has served to highlight the element of interdependence in relations between States: The sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  the fourth session of UNCTAD and the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation—misnamed the North-South dialogue—were all responses of the international community to that awareness. Unfortunately  those conferences have failed to live up to the reasonable expectations of mankind  particularly those of us in the developing world. They have produced little in the way of concrete action. What we are left with now are mere promises for the future.7.	This unhappy situation cannot be allowed to persist. My delegation is  however  not entirely pessimistic. We look forward to positive results from the negotiations that lie ahead. Positive results can  in our view  be best achieved if all nations accept the need for a fundamental restructuring in existing economic relationships.8.	The negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities' and on a common fund are crucial for us. Trinidad and Tobago  like so many other developing countries  produces a number of primary products upon which the health of its economy depends  particularly in respect of employment and foreign exchange earnings. The prices of those commodities continue to be subject to violent fluctuations in the world market with consequent disastrous effects on our economies. It is this common experience which prompts the countries of the developing world to seek an Integrated Programme for Commodities. If such a Programme is to have any impact  it must be supported by adequate and effective financing mechanisms which would facilitate the downstream processing of raw materials in developing countries. To deny developing countries all the necessary facilities and assistance in this process is to perpetuate the traditional colonial pattern of economic relations. We can no longer acquiesce in a system whereby developing countries are restricted to primary production  with all secondary and tertiary activities reserved for metropolitan centres. In short  no longer can we in the Caribbean be expected merely to produce unrefined brown sugar for export. To put it in another way  not only must developing countries produce bauxite and iron ore; they must also manufacture aluminium and finished steel products.9.	The multilateral trade negotiations within GATT and the negotiations within UNCTAD represent continuing efforts by the world community to come to grips with the chronic economic crises which have their most adverse effects in the developing countries. My delegation had hoped that the multilateral trade negotiations would have resulted in the granting of meaningful concessions in favour of the exports of the developing countries  on a non- reciprocal basis  as prescribed in the Tokyo Declaration. In the negotiations under way within UNCTAD on the Integrated Programme for Commodities  although there seems to be agreement in principle on the need for action of the type envisaged in the Integrated Programme  the actual negotiations on individual products and on the common fund have as yet failed to produce agreed programmes of action that would significantly improve prices and market conditions for commodities of export interest to developing countries. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 have spoken eloquently on this point and have expressed their deep concern with the renewed trend towards protectionism in the developed countries because of its negative impact on the export earnings of developing countries and their terms of trade  employment policies and development efforts.10.	Serious -problems exist in respect of debt and the availability of adequate operating credit. At present  the volume of credit available through IMF is not adequate and it is offered on terms which do not necessarily assist development objectives. The modifications to the articles and procedures of IMF agreed to in Jamaica in 1976 have therefore failed so far to recognize the qualitative change in the balance-of-payments problems of developing countries. Those modifications failed further to address themselves to the restrictive conditionality criteria for access to the resources of IMF. The problems involved in ensuring the adequacy of credit  both short-term and long-term  are enormous. All this points to the urgent need to re-examine the structure  functioning and orientation of the existing institutional framework.11.	I come now to the question of science and technology as it relates to development. We have followed closely the discussions and negotiations on the code of conduct for transnational corporations  the code of conduct for the transfer of technology and the preparatory work for the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. These discussions and negotiations are not merely academic for us. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that science and technology lie at the very heart of the development syndrome and at the heart of much of the progress in economic performance and social conditions in the third world. We in Trinidad and Tobago have given full recognition to the important role that science and technology can and should play in economic and social development. The application of science and technology to development will lead to the creation of employment opportunities  the improvement and deepening of the manufacturing sector  the modernization of agriculture  the maintenance of a healthy balance of payments  the improvement in the quality of life  and the preservation of the human environment.12.	We in the third world can effectively benefit from the development in science and technology only through the meaningful transfer of existing and future technology and its adaptation to local needs. We see this transfer of technology as including also the establishment of advanced research facilities and training institutions within the developing countries themselves. We require at this time  also  access to finance  to expertise and machinery and  above all  to markets for our finished products.13.	Conscious of the need to maximize the benefits to be derived from its hydrocarbon resources  Trinidad and Tobago has embarked on a long-term development programme which places paramount emphasis on energy-based industries such as iron and steel  aluminium and fertilizers.14.	It is the intention of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago radically to transform the economy and to diversify the structure and content of production. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago expects that these efforts aimed at its industrial development and informed by a spirit of self-reliance will receive the support and co-operation of the developed countries. It is our reasonable hope that these efforts will not be deliberately thwarted.15.	Trinidad and Tobago sees tremendous advantages to be obtained by developing countries from the application of science and technology to the development process. It is for this reason that we look forward with some optimism to the 1979 United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. That Conference is seen by us as a major watershed in international relations  for it will provide the real test for partnership and co-operation between nations.16.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is committed to co-operation with all States  developed as well as developing  and to the pursuance of new forms and methods for such co-operation. It has over the years played a responsible role in the affairs of the Caribbean and has indicated its willingness to contribute to the economic stability and development of the region. We have undertaken new initiatives in the field of economic and financial co-operation and we have kept the Secretary-General of the United Nations informed of our efforts. It is our hope *hat States with interests in the development of the region will respond positively to those initiatives.17.	Such a positive response will assist States in the region and will go some small way towards arresting what seems to be a trend towards greater polarization of nations. As recently as 24 September 1977  the first anniversary of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  the Prime Minister  the Honourable Eric Williams  in the course of his inaugural address to the first Islamic Conference of South America and the Caribbean which was held in Trinidad and Tobago  remarked on this trend:.. Humanity now finds itself facing another world crisis. It is the crisis of a polarization between the affluent developed societies and the under-developed societies on the verge of famine; the one literate  with a virtual monopoly of industrial development and high energy consumption; the other illiterate  begging that 25 per cent of the world's industrial development be reserved for it  with low energy consumption; the one discriminating against  the other discriminated against..."".18.	I have tried to give expression to our aspirations in respect of the economic development process. I have sought to indicate some of the main policy objectives of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago as it attempts to make its leap forward. I have underlined the need for self- reliance  co-operation and partnership in that development process. We realize  however  that development can take place only in an ordered and peaceful world. We see grave threats to this peace and order in the situation in southern Africa. In Zimbabwe  Ian Smith refuses in rude and obstinate fashion to accept majority rule as the basis for constitutional government in that territory. In Namibia  South Africa refuses to cease its illegal occupation-and in South Africa itself the system of apartheid continues to be practised with all the repressive turn that racist regime can command. In the Middle East and Cyprus the situation continues to smoulder.19.	The concern of Trinidad and Tobago with these developments has found expression in our continued condemnation of apartheid  our support for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe to achieve majority rule and independence  and for the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination.20.	Trinidad and Tobago has affirmed its support for the principles of the non-use of force in international relations  of the non-acquisition of territory by force  of respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of all States  and of the right of all States to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. In this respect  my delegation supports the efforts under way to reconvene the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  but holds the view that the situation cannot be resolved without the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.21.	Trinidad and Tobago  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  has always supported the right of all people still under colonial rule to self- determination  and here my delegation wishes to express once more its solidarity with the people of Belize  whose legitimate right to freedom  independence and territorial integrity have too long been frustrated. Those Members of the United Nations family that have the facilities should provide credible guarantees to the people of Belize for the enjoyment of that right.22.	The Secretary-General of the United Nations in reviewing the work of the Organization over the past year  was optimistic about the ability of the United Nations to help to create the kind of environment in which international peace and security can be maintained  and in which economic and social development can keep pace with rising expectations. We are happy to share his optimism. We recognize however  that the serious problems which face the Organization must be resolved if it is to continue to maintain its contribution to world order.23.	Trinidad and Tobago will continue to give its full support to the United Nations in the pursuit of its laudable objectives. We perceive those objectives to include the establishment of a world order which is just and equitable and the creation of peaceful and stable conditions in which mankind can achieve its economic  social and cultural well-being. We are of the firm conviction that those objectives can be achieved only if Member nations accept the basic imperatives of self-reliance  partnership and co-operation. "
"128",6935,"TUN",32,1977,"﻿107.	 It is a pleasure for me  first of all  to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Tunisia and on my own behalf  warm congratulations on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly.108.	We are doubly pleased by that election: first because of your experience acquired in this Organization  your thorough knowledge of international problems  your sensitivity and your adherence to the opinion of the overwhelming majority of delegation on major problems. Those qualities assure us that you will conduct our work with wisdom and competence and that you will guide our discussions towards results that will have the most fortunate consequences for the development of international affairs. We are also pleased that the man occupying that post is the representative of a country which is dear to us and to which we are linked by bonds of an- old friendship and by the close relations that were established between our President Habib Bourguiba and Marshall Tito and derive from a common struggle for independence  the strengthening of national sovereignty and the triumph of law everywhere where it has been ignored. Furthermore  there is nothing more natural than to see those two men  after having accomplished their domestic missions  meet again to promote the policy of non-alignment which they have guided side by side until it has acquired the authority it has today.109.	I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the enormous efforts unceasingly made by marshal Tito to strengthen the policy of non-alignment and we wish him long life and all success in his task.110.	I should also like to express my thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Amerasinghe  who presided over our last session with an exemplary skill  which can be a source of pride not only to his country but to all non-aligned States.111.	I also wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his good work in strengthening the foundations of our Organization and for his serenity in meeting the difficulties he encounters in the service of peace and security with good grace  dedication and devotion.112.	This year the United Nations has admitted two new Members. We warmly welcome that major event and we rejoice at the happy tradition adopted by the United Nations of welcoming new Members to the international family in succeeding years. That tradition allows us to foster the firm hope that the efforts of peoples fighting for their independence will inevitably be crowned by success and that year after year we will welcome new Members in our midst. Thus  in a few years the remaining peoples who are struggling will be freed and colonialism will have disappeared from the surface of the globe.113.	On behalf of the Government of Tunisia I address a welcome to the delegation of Djibouti  a brother country. We express the hope that the accession to international responsibility will herald for the people of Djibouti a new era in which it will realize its hopes of dignity and development. I assure that country on behalf of the Government and people of Tunisia of our solidarity and our support in strengthening the basis of Djibouti's sovereignty and guaranteeing its invulnerability.114.	I bid a most warm welcome also to the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and on behalf of President Bourguiba and of the Tunisian Government I greet the great people of Viet Nam and the memory of its immortal leader  President Ho Chi Minh. That people has given the noblest example of heroism and we hope that its admission to membership in the United Nations will strengthen this Organization and will enable it to extend its basis of universality and solve the problems it is called upon to consider.115.	Every year we meet on this occasion in order to take stock of our actions and to assess  the progress we have made in the service of international peace and solidarity. To judge by the extent of that progress  we can hardly claim that there is cause for satisfaction or that we can feel reassured. The present situation is particularly obscure  and it gives rise to doubts and apprehensions of all kinds. The international political situation reveals no more substantial progress than the economic and social situation since last year. Thus we begin this new session facing the same problems we considered at the last session. However  these problems have become worse  and this situation constitutes a serious danger for peace.116.	We are among those who firmly believe that the United Nations is the best body available to mankind as a forum where opposing views can be voiced and appropriate solutions sought. We believe also that there is a need to consolidate the foundations of this Organization and to guard against its adopting positions contrary to its principles117.	The agenda for this session is full of irrelevant items and I do not intend to go into them all in detail. That would take up too much time. I shall simply refer to the most important questions and define the position of my Government on them.118.	First of all  we have the question of Palestine and the question of the Middle East. It is undeniable that last year these two problems were subjects of increasing interest to world opinion and world leaders. But that interest  in our view  has not been commensurate with the danger that those two problems entail. In fact we in the twentieth century are facing the greatest test for mankind  which squarely confronts the United Nations. In such circumstances we cannot give way to inertia or despair  especially when we realize the dimensions of the problem and when everyone recognizes today that the guilty party in this situation and the party responsible for its deterioration is not the victim  a people expelled from its home  robbed of its property and forced into exile  but  on the contrary  the party which has despoiled the land of another  disregarded all the rules of morality and has had the effrontery to deny the truth of history and of the real facts.119.	The problem we face today has gone beyond all ordinary political criteria and all normally admitted moral rules. More than ever we must ask ourselves whether or not the fundamental ideals of the United Nations can inspire it to act with the same rigour towards all its Members. Are we to believe that some Members have formed the unbreakable habit of not complying with the rules and of responding to events with inertia and indifference? If that is so  what recourse is left for the victim of aggression? How can we ask the victim to be patient  to prefer political solutions  and to be realistic  while the aggressor hardens his position further  closes the door and invents all sorts of excuses to close the way to any sincere and frank negotiation  and while the aggressor denies the victim the right even to a normal life of human dignity.120.	For a year now both problems have gone through a difficult stage. The General Assembly last year was not able to reach positive resolutions likely to open up the way to settlement of the problems. The reason was that the last Israeli Government refused to undertake any action on the grounds that Israeli legislative elections were near  and that we heeded the recommendations of those who wanted us to observe restraint  to wait for the elections to take place  and for a Labour Government to emerge from the elections which would have been strongly supported by the voters and which would be sure to take matters seriously in hand and to heed the voice of reason. We were in no way convinced that the future Government would in any way change the attitude of the Israeli State. On the contrary we were certain that that was simply a manoeuvre to gain time  and to get through a difficult political moment when world opinion was becoming increasingly concerned.121.	The world is a witness to the fact that the Arabs have shown flexibility and patience  that no Arab State has taken any measure which could in any way be regarded as chilling the climate or worsening the crisis. On the contrary  the Arab Governments and the PLO itself have tirelessly explored every avenue in seeking means to open the way to a positive solution.122.	The elections have now been held  and events have justified our apprehensions. The Begin Government has come to power; it threatens  it orders  it implements projects about which the least one can say is that they have led to a further deterioration of the situation by carrying aggression and provocation even further and by constantly challenging world public opinion.123.	The entire world  including the friends and supporters of Israel  recognizes that the question of the Middle East can be resolved only by setting the Palestinian problem and allowing the Palestinian people to exercise its rights  that is  to take form as a political entity and regain its sovereignty. But the Israeli Government denies the existence of a Palestinian entity or Palestinian sovereignty  going only so far as to offer the Palestinians only the prospect of absorption within the Israeli or Jordan entities or other Arab entities.124.	Political experience and sound reasoning have taught us that discussion will be effective only if it takes place between the two belligerents represented respectively by their delegations. But the Israeli Government would keep away the organization which is at war with Israel and which is the genuine representative of the Palestinian people—the PLO-and will consent to discussions only with partners of its own choosing.125.	The United Nations has recommended to the parties concerned  and Israel's friends have earnestly counselled  that no step be taken that is likely to impede the search for peaceful solutions or further complicate the situation. Israel has not heeded this call; it has increased the number of new settlements in the hope of altering the demographic structure of the occupied regions. It is committing aggression against an independent neighbour country  Lebanon  for the purpose of facing the world with a fait accompli likely to strengthen its position in future bargaining and to create a new problem so as to distract world public opinion from the fundamental problem.126.	The conscience of the world proclaims the illegitimacy of the occupation of foreign territories by force and the need for Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories occupied since 1967. The Israeli Government responds with various devices. At one time it claims that if a territory was occupied and settled it was not with a view to subsequent withdrawal and surrender of that territory; at another it claims that withdrawal from a territory is a negotiable principle.127.	Thus we find ourselves  with regard to the Palestinian problem as well as with regard to the question of the Middle East  in a situation more tense than before.128.	Of course  laudable efforts are being made to bring the matter out of the confusion with which Israel is busily beclouding the issue. Complete knowledge of the question and of the basic facts is becoming more general and taking hold. The Tunisian Government wishes to pay a tribute to these efforts and to any sincere and honest initiative to that end. However  the Tunisian Government believes that such efforts must stem from the following essential considerations.129.	First  the Palestinian question and the question of the Middle East are complementary and inseparable elements of the same whole.130.	Secondly  the Palestinian problem will find a final and lasting solution only with the participation of the sons of the country and the participation  on their behalf  of those whom they themselves have chosen to that end  excluding all other imposed representatives. The Tunisian Government believes that at present there is no one speaking on behalf of Palestine with more credit  more representative character and more authority than the PLO.131.	Thirdly  the discussion must start with the recognition of the right of. the Palestinians to form an independent Palestinian entity in conformity with the United Nations resolution of 1947  as President Bourguiba has frequently recommended.132.	Fourthly  the fait accompli which emerged from the war of 1967 is null and void. The withdrawal from occupied territories is therefore not subject to discussion but is a matter of compliance under international law and relevant United Nations resolutions.133.	Fifthly  coexistence can be established only if Israel renounces its expansionist policy  and its wish to impose its hegemony on the region and if the right of the peoples of the region to make the choice of their destinies is recognized.134.	In any event  like other speakers who preceded me to this rostrum  I wish once again to appeal to the conscience of the countries represented here  and to ask them to join in active and deep solidarity so that  going beyond the stage of words  we may undertake positive action. We have spoken for a quarter of a century  we have adopted tens of resolutions. Israel has become familiar with that method of work  and has become used to it. To every resolution we have adopted  Israel has responded by an active challenge ranging from the increased torture and harassment of our fellow Arabs to the multiplication of settlements to give it a better hold on the area. Our task at this session is to adopt firm resolutions to halt Israel in its tracks and prevent it from pursuing its arrogant challenge. We cannot permit that challenge  for it carries with it the seed of a war which could go beyond the region of the Middle East and present the gravest dangers to world peace.135.	There is another region which arouses our concern and deep anxiety. In this region  the situation in principle is not different from that prevailing in occupied Palestine  because public order there is based on racism and racial segregation. I am referring to southern Africa. Although we thought that the independence of the countries neighbouring South Africa and Rhodesia would lead these two countries to change their view of things and to take into account the inescapable evolution of mankind  we note that their regime is increasingly turning inward and persisting in its excesses and obstinacy. I need not recall the various resolutions adopted by the Organization over the years  which have been made dead letters by the South African Government. Nor shall I recall the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe and Namibia. The events of Soweto are still present in our minds and remind us of the horror of the tragedy  and of the executions and sufferings which have become the lot of the indigenous population of the area. In addition  the racist South African Government has made Namibia a base from which to launch acts of aggression against Zambia  Angola and Mozambique  thus endangering the security of those African countries.136.	It is perhaps futile to propose new resolutions on the subject  for we know that their fate will be the same as that of previous resolutions. Nevertheless  Tunisia calls upon the Security Council to ensure the implementation of its resolution 385 (1976) requiring that free elections be held in Namibia under the supervision and control of the United Nations.137.	The Tunisian Government  furthermore  appeals to the great Powers and the African States to adopt a firm position in that regard and to impose political  economic  military and cultural isolation upon the Governments of South Africa and Rhodesia in order to exercise pressure which would place both regimes under the obligation of complying with resolutions of the United Nations.138.	The most recent news we have received indicates that the Rhodesian question may be moving towards a settlement. The proposals made by the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom  while not responding entirely to legitimate African aspirations  are in fact a negotiable basis for action and can serve as a new point of departure for treatment of the problem.139.	What is important in our view is to get things moving and once and for all to cease treating the problem in a colonialist spirit. There is no longer any question of resorting to manoeuvres  to procrastination or to delaying tactics to gain a few weeks or a few months. While giving its full backing to African liberation  my Government supports every laudable effort aimed at facilitating peaceful solutions and in bringing closer the period of security and peace.140.	During our statement at the previous session of the General Assembly  we stressed our concern over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Our apprehensions are not less today  in view of the trends which we see in the world and which indicate an increase in the quantity of weapons in their accumulation and in proliferation. What gives rise to even greater concern on our part is the probable existence of those weapons in some countries  such as Israel or South Africa  that would not be prevented by international morality and law from committing aggression against others.141.	Many resolutions of the United Nations adopted on this subject have remained a dead letter. As an example  I would mention the resolution which appeals to militarily and economically developed countries to reduce their military budgets and to devote some of the funds thus freed to assistance to developing countries.142.	We deplore the fact that no progress has been made so far along that road  although there have been abundant contacts and discussions and the means to overcome present difficulties are not lacking. While we are pleased that a special session of the United Nations on the question of disarmament will be held in May and June of 1978  my Government hopes that at the present session the Assembly may overcome the obstacles to a conclusion of an international agreement on the prohibition of the use of force in international relations.143.	This leads me to refer to international economic relations and to present the position of my country on that subject. Tunisia  as the entire world knows  is as a matter of principle in complete solidarity with the positions adopted by the Group of 77 and defined in the many conferences of the non-aligned countries.144.	The international economic situation continues to be characterized by disorder and disequilibrium which give rise to what the Secretary-General in his report has wisely described as  an uncertainty more pervasive than at any time since the end of the Second World War.145.	It is increasingly obvious that this situation is the result especially of the economic policies followed in industrialized countries  which  by concentrating on solving their immediate national problems  neglect the search for lasting solutions which would benefit the international community as a whole.146.	The protectionist measures recently adopted by some developed countries with regard to the textile exports of a large number of developing countries  including Tunisia  is proof of that regrettable trend. Those measures and other similar ones  by limiting the scope of action of international co-operation and in dangerously limiting the expansion of world trade  especially that of developing countries  not only further retard the economic development and social progress of the latter countries  but also hamper recovery in the developed countries themselves.147.	Let us not be mistaken. The concept of the interdependence of economies proclaimed here and there is more than a mere slogan. It cannot be interpreted in any restricted sense. Non-compliance with the obligations of interdependence can have nefarious consequences for all.148.	The need to establish a new international economic order arose out of the desire to shield the economies of all countries from upheavals of that nature and to provide the international community with the conditions for harmonious development with justice and loyal co-operation. Now  while we applaud the decision adopted recently by some Powers to remove their objections of principle to the pursuit of that objective  we can only regret the obstinacy which persists in refusing to implement the measures needed for its implementation.149.	While the hopes we had with regard to the seventh special session remain unfulfilled  we see that the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation has concluded with results which fall well short of the most reasonable aspirations. However  it would be wrong not to recognize that the action of the North-South dialogue made possible a break-through towards the establishment of a new international economic order.150.	Is it not comforting to note that  despite all the difficulties  developed countries and developing countries have declared that they wish to pursue the dialogue? Countries members of the Group of 77  for their part  have reaffirmed their favourable disposition in this respect in the declaration which their Ministers for Foreign Affairs adopted on 29 September.151.	Now we must give new momentum to global economic negotiations and place them within their normal framework  which is that of the United Nations system under the continuous political supervision of the General Assembly.152.	Those  global negotiations naturally can be supplemented by regional and interregional negotiations which  in their appropriate forums  can contribute to the dialogue and to efforts at establishing a new international economic order. Euro-Arab discussions and Afro-Arab discussions which have already produced concrete results are part of those efforts. Tunisia for its part is making its contribution to the initiation and pursuit of such discussions.153.	Global negotiations should continue to be based mainly on the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations  and in particular on the resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions and on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. It should  however  be possible to includein the over-all process of the establishment of a new international economic order any specific decisions adopted at the prior Paris Conference that Member countries of our Organization as a whole consider to be positive.154.	The agenda of this session makes it possible to start  on a solid footing  the process whose progress has to be reassessed in the coming two or three years so that it may be taken account of in connexion with the adoption of the new international development strategy planned for the beginning of the next development decade. Furthermore  it would be tragic to think that what was expected of the dialogue would be attained by placing developing countries in categories or by deciding to benefit one group of countries or another through limited or ephemeral measures that would be contrary to general measures aimed at the basic restructuring of international economic relations and the solution of the problems  especially structural problems  of all the third-world countries  such as those of indebtedness  industrialization  food production and  naturally  access to the markets of the developed countries.155.	For its part  Tunisia  in beginning this year its fifth development plan  has once more as its central objective control of the problem of unemployment by trying to satisfy all of the additional demand for jobs for the period 1977-1981. We believe that is an objective that is in accordance with the hope that several speakers have expressed here  namely  the hope of ensuring  through employment  a better distribution of income within each country  and so meeting the essential needs of all members of society. In this  my country relies mainly on the efforts of its people and on its national resources. Those resources are  however  as limited as those of many countries which receive particular attention from the international community. We should like to hope that such aid and understanding will not be lacking.156.	All the questions that we are discussing at present are being dealt with only at the official government level. It is rare for them to be made the subject of the dissemination of information as they deserve or to be brought to the attention of public opinion in order that public opinion may participate  even though indirectly  in the search for the solutions they call for. In fact  public opinion is no longer satisfied with incomplete information and does not easily accept facts transmitted to it which are molded according to the views of those who publish or disseminate them. There is certainly no need to add that any political  economic or social project could not easily succeed unless accurate and objective information were available concerning it. Aware of the importance of this problem  the developing countries  proceeding with the context of non-alignment  have taken it up and are seeking appropriate solutions at the international level. This effort has not escaped the notice of the United Nations  which  through UNESCO has begun to compile information. At the General Conference of that organization  held at Nairobi in 1976  very important resolutions were adopted. However  those decisions are but a first stage which must be followed by others.157.	In accepting the presidency of the intergovernmental council for the co-ordination of information among non- aligned countries  my country has assumed a heavy responsibility in the field of information within that group. More than once  Tunisia has taken the initiative of entering into a dialogue with Europe directed towards the aim in view  namely  that of compiling information more in keeping with the new type of relations desired by the international community. I would recall here  in particular  the many meetings of African  Arab or non-aligned countries held during the last two years.158.	It was thus that the idea was born of establishing a new world order in the field of information  on the lines of the new international economic order to which we aspire. This new order of information should be aimed at providing world public opinion with more objective and better information able to serve the cause of peace  justice and co-operation among all nations.159.	We hope that this question will attract the interest it deserves in the United Nations so that we may discuss it among the subjects included in the agenda of the thirty- third session of the General Assembly. "
"129",6982,"TUR",32,1977,"﻿149.	 Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of my Government  to congratulate you warmly upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election should be considered a tribute to your country  whose contributions to the United Nations  to the cause of international co-operation and to efforts aimed at strengthening peace are unanimously appreciated.150.	We are particularly pleased that the choice has fallen upon you. In the past you have given ample evidence of your personal qualities and diplomatic skills. We are confident that you will guide the work and the deliberations of the Assembly towards balanced  objective and fruitful conclusions.151.	Speaking on behalf of Turkey  I should like also to express our satisfaction at seeing as President a representative of a country with which Turkey has traditionally enjoyed excellent relations based on a common desire to safeguard and develop understanding  harmony and cooperation in the Balkan region.152.	Allow me also to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Amerasinghe  who presided over the thirty-first session of the General Assembly  distinguishing himself by his diligence and competence.153.	I should also like to reiterate the appreciation of my Government to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our Secretary-General  for all his efforts to promote the principles and ideals of the United Nations.154.	At this session the United Nations family has expanded with the admission of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. A new and very important step has thus been taken in the field of decolonization towards the ultimate objective of the universality of the United Nations and the consecration of the ideals and principles of the Charter.155.	I should like to welcome with joy the representatives of these countries. The road which has led to the independence and unity of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has been marked by countless trials and tragic sufferings. We wish the people of Viet Nam every success in its task of reconstruction  which it has already begun.156.	We look forward to establishing close relations with Djibouti  which will surely be facilitated by the cultural affinities existing between our two countries.157.	It is always difficult to make a global evaluation in the field of human activities. In reviewing the problems which confront us  in reflecting on the situation which exists at this particular time and on the prospects for the future and in evoking the recent history on which today's world has been modelled  one cannot help being perplexed by the developments which inspire optimism and those which give rise to apprehension and even distress. The changes and developments which have taken place over the last quarter of a century  particularly the progress in science and technology  the intensification of international and regional co-operation  the absence of a generalized conflagration  the achievements in the economic and social fields in certain parts of the world  detente between the major Powers  and the moral and political force  exercised by the third world in favour of peace and an international order in keeping with the principles of justice  have certainly brought immense benefits to mankind. But the greatest danger  that of the destruction of the whole world as a result of nuclear war  has not yet vanished. The objective of an international order guaranteeing the harmonization of the interests of the members of the international community still seems to be very remote. The problems on a world scale seem to multiply with the increase of the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  the allocation of enormous resources to the ever accelerating arms race  the increasing urgency of energy problems  the depletion of non-renewable resources  the persistence of under-development and poverty  and the accentuation of the disparities between the industrialized countries and those countries which are developing. To all these problems  one should add the continuation of the acute conflicts and tensions in several regions of the world.158.	Each year we gather in this universal forum to discuss these pending problems and to attempt to provide a substantial contribution to their solution. At this session our attention will be concentrated in particular on issues concerning southern Africa  the Middle East  disarmament  human rights and international economic co-operation.159.	For several years now  southern Africa has been a focal-point for the preoccupations of the United Nations. But the situation there has never been as critical as it is at this time  nor has it ever presented a greater danger to the peace and security of the world. It is both urgent and imperative that a peaceful solution be found for the problems of southern Africa. The International Conference  in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and of Namibia in their struggle for liberation  which convened in Maputo in May  and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  which met in Lagos in August  have emphasized the need for urgent and appropriate action concerning problems of southern Africa. Those two Conferences constitute important steps towards the mobilization of international action for the support of the peoples of southern Africa. We are of the opinion that the international campaign against the minority regimes of southern Africa should be conducted with vigour and perseverance.160.	Despite the deplorable tension which exists in southern Africa today  we still maintain our hope for a peaceful solution. We are following  with special interest  the efforts made with a view to achieving independence for the peoples of Namibia and of Zimbabwe through negotiations. We hope that those efforts will be crowned with success and will lead to just and early results.161.	In this context  it should be emphasized that any solution to the problem of Namibia should take into account the basic principles contained in Security Council resolution 385 (1976). In Southern Rhodesia the entire international community demands a constitutional government based on majority rule.162.	The peaceful return to legality in Southern Rhodesia must involve the restoration of peace in the first instance  so that thereafter there could be further steps towards decolonizing that Territory. We  therefore  support the Security Council's latest resolution which aims at facilitating and accelerating the transition to majority rule in Southern Rhodesia. It should be emphasized that no lasting solution can be found to the questions of Namibia and Southern Rhodesia without the active participation of SWAPO and the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe.163.	In South Africa there can be no solution to the problem of apartheid as long as the Government of that country maintains its policy of excluding the majority of the population from the political life of the country and as long as it imprisons or exiles the acknowledged and respected leaders of that majority. Such a policy can only create increasing internal strife "" provoke international outrage and diminish the chances of a peaceful evolution towards majority rule.164.	The Middle East conflict still constitutes the most serious source of danger for peace. We observe  with increasing anxiety  that the fundamental causes of that crisis have not yet been eliminated  that the principal elements are still unresolved  that the occupation of Arab territories continues  and that the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine are still ignored.165.	The position of my country on this problem remains unchanged. Turkey firmly opposes the acquisition of territory by force. It believes that a solution will have to be based on a restoration by Israel to their rightful owners of all the territories occupied during the war of 1967. We also believe that the solution to the problem should safeguard the independence  sovereignty and the security of the recognized frontiers of all the countries of the region. Such a solution should take into account the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine  including their right to establish a State of their own.166.	The ratification of the rights of the Palestinians is an essential element of any negotiating process. The proposed Geneva Conference will have to be open to the participation of all parties directly concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization. In this context  we welcome with satisfaction the joint statement on the Middle East issued by the United States and the Soviet Union on 1 October. We hope that the initiatives taken with a view to convening the Geneva Conference as quickly as possible v/ill be successful and that rapid and substantial progress will be made towards a just and equitable solution very soon.»167.	Without a solution to the problem as a whole that would establish a durable peace  there is a risk that that region will once again be dragged into a crisis that might well be more devastating and dangerous than ever. On the way to substantial negotiations  the parties should refrain from all action that might exacerbate the existing situation. In this context  the establishment of settlements on the left bank of the Jordan River clearly constitutes an obstacle to the search for peace.168.	More than 30 years have elapsed since the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted its first resolution concerning disarmament. During the period since then  despite regular appeals by the international community for disarmament  occasional intensive negotiations and a number of international agreements  the arms race continues at an increased speed  threatening the peace and security of all countries and absorbing the resources urgently needed by the developing countries. This arms race is incompatible with efforts aimed at establishing a new international economic order and is also in contradiction with the policy of detente. Indeed  in a world where peace is essentially based on a balance of forces the distrust which results from divergent evaluations of that balance will render detente precarious  and there will always be the danger of a greater intensification of the armament efforts. The dangers involved in the proliferation of nuclear arms and the development of new techniques-to say nothing of the accumulation of conventional weapons -could render the present balance uncontrollable and could lead to rapid and dangerous upheavals.169.	Despite these disturbing developments  it is nevertheless encouraging that the world is becoming more and more aware of the dangers of the universal arms race. The decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament comes at a propitious moment. My Government hopes that that special session will give a strong impetus to negotiations on disarmament.170.	The Charter itself urges the United Nations to undertake the task of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The constitutional and political system of Turkey is based on the concept that economic and social rights  on the one hand  and civil and political rights  on the other  are inseparable and interdependent. We are also convinced that a world order based on peace  justice and equality cannot be conceived without the respect and effective protection of human rights.171.	Mankind should be protected not only against oppression and injustice but also against terror and violence. My country  which has recently been the victim of several attacks against the lives of its diplomatic representatives  is ready to contribute to initiatives taken to combat effectively international violence.172.	The North-South dialogue on the establishment of a new international economic order will  no doubt  occupy a very important place in our deliberations. During this session we will have the opportunity to review the results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation  a task that was carried over from the thirty-first session.173.	Despite the fact that some agreements-although limited in scope and nature-were reached in the Conference  it is clearly understood that the global issues comprised in the process of reshaping the new economic order can best be dealt with in the United Nations system. We believe  in fact  that negotiations within a larger framework will facilitate the consensus and prevent repetition of discussions made in other forums.174.	In the negotiations on the establishment of a new international economic order it would be wrong to think that where one party gains the other must necessarily lose. Such aw assumption could have been understandable to a certain extent in the short term; however  in the medium and long terms it will definitely be possible to deal with the problems in such a way as to converge and maximize the interests of all the parties concerned.175.	The new international economic order cannot be established overnight. But concrete measures should be taken to start the negotiating process within a reasonable period and according to a specified time-table. Those negotiations should concentrate on non-discriminatory and preferential treatment for the manufactures of the developing countries  more stable and higher prices for their raw materials  a code of conduct for transnational companies  greater access to technology  a greater voice for the developing countries in decisions on international monetary affairs and increasing financial flows towards the developing world.176.	On the other hand  the negotiations on those problems must not make us lose sight of the urgent problems faced by the developing countries. Those problems cannot await the establishment of the new international economic order. The balance-of-payments difficulties of the least developed countries as well as the middle-income countries call for urgent remedies. The international financial institutions cannot lose sight of the particular characteristics of the economies of the developing countries. In a world dominated by injustice and social and economic disparity those countries could hardly be called upon to restrict their growth perspectives for the sake of strict internal financial stability; on the contrary  emphasis should be laid on increasing the flow of external savings to them.177.	In the field of long-term measures aimed at restructuring the world economic order  a fundamental fact imposes itself. The present economic order which was established in the post-war era enables the transfer of resources to the developing countries only in ratio to the growth rate in the industrialized countries. If this concept remains unchanged  all serious efforts would be stalled until the end of the recession. But under existing conditions  it is most probable that the medium-term growth performance of the industrialized countries will fall far short of that recorded during the 1960s. Does this mean that throughout this period we should follow a policy that would delay the growth in the developing countries?178.	It becomes more and more evident that  in the final analysis  economic growth in the industrialized countries depends upon their economic and trade relations with the developing- world. Increasing industrial exports to the developing countries constitutes a very significant indicator in this respect. It is evident that the transfer of real resources to the developing countries not only will help increase the supply of raw materials to the industrialized countries  but also will enable the developing countries to import more from the former.179.	It is more or less an established fact that the transformation the world economy is undergoing and the adoption of new methods of approach to development problems  should lead the United Nations to embark on a new strategy  which ought-to take into account the present situation and the international economic negotiating process  as well as the. concept of a new economic order.180.	The Cyprus question is once again on the agenda of the General Assembly. We regret that this conflict  which has lasted since 1963  has not as yet found a just and equitable solution which would allow the two Cypriot communities to coexist and co-operate in their common interest. It is quite apparent that it is only through negotiations that a comprehensive solution to the problem can be reached and that the most effective contribution of the General Assembly to this end should be looked for within this context. Unfortunately  the procedural decision adopted at the beginning of this session cannot contribute to meaningful debate. There exists a fundamental contradiction between the resolutions of the General Assembly  which call on the two communities to continue the negotiations  and a procedure which prevents the participation of one of the parties to the dispute in those very deliberations. It can very well be said that this attitude is without precedent. In these circumstances  the Assembly cannot hold to a valid debate on the question of Cyprus as long as the Turkish Cypriot community has not been given the right to participate in the debate to the fullest extent permitted by the rules of procedure. Any decision contrary to this principle can only be detrimental to the negotiations.181.	I would not like to refer to the question of Cyprus in a manner which would provoke controversy.182.	I am  rather  of the opinion that we should rigorously refrain from attributing the responsibility for the existing situation in Cyprus to one or the other of the parties. The other day mention was made here of an invasion  of the non-observance by Turkey of the United Nations resolutions  of the presence of Turkish military units on the island. But the reasons for which Turkey was compelled to intervene in July of 1974 have not been explained. Neither has there been any mention of the military coup d'etat instigated at that time by Greece for the purpose of annexing Cyprus. Nor has anything been said about the presence of the Greek army in Cyprus  at times officially and at other times in disguise  ever since 1964. We are quite familiar with the usual litany  according to which Greece was governed by a military junta at the time of the coup of 1974  and that the present Government is not responsible for the crime perpetrated by that junta. This argument cannot be considered as valid. Every State is responsible for the actions of its Governments and has to bear their consequences.183.	The Turkish Cypriots are accused of being intransigent. I do not wish to enter into the details of these questions. It would be enlightening to compare the previous statements of those who used to enjoy military superiority with the declarations they now make  now that the balance of forces has changed. The striking contradiction between these two attitudes is clear evidence of the value of expressions of goodwill and sincerity so generously put forward.184.	The intercommunal talks will certainly continue one way or another. It would therefore be not only useless but also extremely harmful to try to put the blame on one party or the other for the lack of results. Let us not try to be the judge  but  rather  let us try  by all means at our disposal  to encourage negotiation and agreement.185.	The negotiating process cannot be divided. Its scope is the entirety of questions to which a solution has to be found in order to reach a settlement within the framework fixed by Archbishop Makarios and President Denktas at their meeting last February  with the participation of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. It would be useless to prejudge the result of the intercommunal talks.186.	The position of Turkey regarding the Cyprus question has frequently been explained from this rostrum. In our opinion  the future solution should be based on the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. Even though Turkey is not a non-aligned country  it believes that a policy of non-alignment would be desirable for Cyprus and would contribute to the peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean.187.	The events precipitated by the Greek military intervention in 1974 have inevitably produced a regrouping of the two communities. Sixty thousand Turkish Cypriots have found refuge in the north of the island after abandoning their homes and properties in the south. A movement in the opposite direction has taken place for the Greek Cypriot population of the north of the island. An agreement between the two communities has completed this exchange of population various problems that have emanated from these movements can be settled only within the framework of an over-all solution.188.	The Turkish forces that are in Cyprus have been sent there in conformity with the obligations undertaken by Turkey. However  Turkey does not have the least intention of keeping its forces in Cyprus. It has already substantially reduced its forces on the island The totality of troops sent to Cyprus after the events of July 1974 will be withdrawn as soon as a lasting political solution is reached. However  a complete withdrawal of Turkish troops in the absence of such a solution and in the present' atmosphere of distrust and political tension is unthinkable. One cannot ask Turkey to abandon the Turkish Cypriot community to the mercy of a majority demanding vehemently and fanatically the return of the status quo ante  which  for the Turkish Cypriots  was but a regime of tyranny and oppression.189.	To conclude with the Cyprus question  I should like to reiterate that Turkey will continue by every possible means to encourage the intercommunal talks with a view to reaching a just and equitable solution as rapidly as possible.190.	This same desire is true also for the bilateral issues that exist between Turkey and Greece. We are ready to continue the negotiations already undertaken on these questions more than two years ago.191.	By the terms of the Charter ail Member States have undertaken the responsibility for promoting international co-operation and safeguarding peace and security. The principles enshrined in the Charter must always guide our actions in our bilateral and multilateral relations.192.	It is here in this universal forum that all Governments should deploy all their efforts in order to realize the aspirations of their peoples to bequeath to future generations a world that is more just  more equitable and more prosperous. It is in this spirit that I should like to end my statement by reiterating our most sincere wishes for the success of the work of the thirty-second session and by assuring the Assembly that my delegation will be ready to contribute its utmost to that end.

"130",7044,"TZA",32,1977,"﻿23.	 Mr. President  the Tanzanian delegation is very happy to see you preside over the deliberations of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We consider your elevation to the high post of President to be a mark of recognition of your personal qualities and your notable role in the efforts of the United Nations to attain its goals  as well as a recognition of the outstanding role played by your country  Yugoslavia  in mankind's quest for a better  just and more secure world order. We are confident that you will discharge your heavy responsibilities with skill and distinction.24.	Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for his remarkable leadership of the thirty-first session.25.	It is a matter of particular satisfaction to us that two eminent representatives of the non-aligned movement have  in succession  occupied the highest office of our Assembly.26.	The admission to the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti are great landmarks in the history of the United Nations. Their admission comes as the culmination of long struggles against colonial and imperialist domination in their respective territories  struggles with which the United Nations was closely identified.27.	The independence of Djibouti and its subsequent membership in both the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations constitute yet another victory in the rapid process of the liquidation of colonialism in Africa.28.	The presence in our midst of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is in many ways a source of special satisfaction. Viet Nam's legendary struggle against foreign domination and imperialist aggression and its triumph against incredible odds will always be considered one of the most brilliant and inspiring chapters of man's resistance to domination and injustice. There is no doubt that Viet Nam's rich experience in the struggle for national liberation and the defence of freedom will be an invaluable asset to our Organization. The Tanzanian delegation is privileged to have sponsored the membership of both Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in the United Nations and we look forward to an era of close co-operation with their respective delegations.29.	In his report on the work of the United Nations over the past year the Secretary-General has been as frank as his sense of realism has permitted. Hopes that 1977 might see a more earnest search for international peace were short-lived. The list of global problems this year is intimidating for  while old problems continue to elude solutions and threaten to worsen  new ones  no less grave and equally pressing  have cropped up.30.	The problems of the Middle East  southern Africa  Cyprus and Korea  some of which are as old as the United Nations itself  have almost become part of our normal life. The prospects for disarmament are rendered ludicrous by the inconsistency between sanctimonious rhetoric and the feverish pursuit of nuclear-weapons superiority. Large populations suffer mass starvation while a few wallow in crass  conspicuous consumption. We witness a deteriorating human environment and the threat of conflicts spilling on to the oceans. All these problems are still on the waiting list for solution  while others join and lengthen the queue.31.	Whether we admit it or not  the world is today engulfed in forebodings of a great upheaval. No amount of dramatization is enough to describe the perilous nature of the circumstances in which we exist today. The behaviour man displays in this situation through action and inaction simply defies comprehension.32.	Yet in reality it is not so much the absence of solutions to these problems as the lack of will to apply the solutions to the problems that is responsible for their continued existence. This situation is both a cause of frustration and a basis for hope. It is a cause of frustration because the human mind is and has proved itself ingenious enough to be able to solve the most complex problems if man decides so to do. It is a basis for hope because we continue to believe that man's instinct for survival  if not his desire for life  has not disappeared and that one day he will act to prevent his extinction.33.	It is  for example  this lack of will that constitutes a stumbling-block to the creation of a new international economic order. The way in which the Conference on International Economic Co-operation ended in Paris this year and the subsequent assessment exercise at the resumed thirty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly demonstrated that.34.	No one who is honest with himself can today deny the fact that the current international economic situation is in a state of crisis. Nobody  therefore  can pretend that far- reaching changes are not called for if that trend is to be reversed.35.	The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly in 1974  and 3202  were the first collective attempt by the international community towards the establishment of a new international economic order. The seventh special session of the General Assembly on development and international economic co-operation  which followed in September 1975  adopted concrete guidelines for further negotiations intended to lead to the establishment of a new partnership between the developed and the developing countries. So the framework for the solution of the problems of which we are at present seized has already been laid down. The Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the resolutions of the seventh special session on development and international economic co-operation together constitute the foundation for a new type of relationship among nations based on sovereign equality  justice and interdependence.36.	To suggest  therefore  at this stage that the solution to world economic problems should be more charity— euphemistically called ""aid""— for the developing countries  in whatever form the suggestion is presented  is simply to side-track the central issue.37.	The events which followed the seventh special session revealed a persistent lack of political will  particularly on the part of some Western developed countries  to translate the decisions taken at that session into practical action. It was that lack of political will for change which prevented the fourth session of UNCTAD  held in Nairobi  from taking definitive decisions on the crucial issues related to the debt problems of the developing countries  the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the common fund. The UNCTAD Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  held in Geneva in March of this year  broke down without agreement-again because of the negative attitude displayed by some Western developed countries.38.	For example  the Integrated Programme for Commodities  one of the major reforms being proposed for international trade on commodities  seeks to ensure stable prices for the primary commodities and raw materials exported by the developing countries. Stable prices would also ensure reasonable security of supplies  which is obviously of benefit to the consumers  mainly the developed countries. The Programme is being criticized by certain developed countries for interfering with so-called market forces. Yet those very countries which talk about free trade and market forces are the same countries which  first  determine the terms of trade and  secondly  continuously interfere with the so-called market forces by imposing a multiplicity of barriers  tariff and non-tariff  to the importation of both primary commodities and processed goods from the developing countries.39.	This same resistance to structural changes in the world economy also dominated the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation  which went on for more than 18 months. The developed countries were interested mainly in discussing how aid could be given to the underprivileged  while the developing countries were interested in fundamental structural changes that would in concrete terms eliminate the very root-causes which led to the condition of being underprivileged.40.	One of the timely opportunities for rectifying economic inequality in the world is presented by the on-going negotiations on the future international legal regime of the oceans. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is taking place to enable the world community to make a critical choice between  on the one hand  perpetuating a legal regime of privilege for a few  with all the social and political consequences we know will surely follow  and  on the other  establishing a just and more progressive legal order.41.	It is a matter for profound regret that those who already have on land more than they deserve are waging the most desperate fight to get everything possible out of the oceans in complete disregard of the rights and interests of the ""have-nots"". If the developed countries were sincere in their sympathy and their desire to improve the lot of the masses in the developing countries  they would seize this opportunity  for example  to place the international resources of the sea-bed at the disposal of a world authority that would manage and distribute the benefits  primarily to assist the developing countries. That act would not really involve any sacrifice. Unfortunately  the developed countries are prepared neither to do without that wealth nor even to share it equitably. So eager  in fact  are they to add it to their possessions that they are even threatening to seize it and frustrate all the efforts of the Conference in general  In the negotiations Tanzania will continue to stand for justice and equality  for the success of that Conference will be measured not merely by the conclusion of a convention  but by what that convention stands for.42.	It is the desire of the developing countries that changes in the economic relationships between the rich and poor be brought about smoothly and through dialogue. This desire has been amply demonstrated in recent negotiations. But it can be fulfilled only if it is met with similar political will on the part of the developed countries. Unfortunately  most developed countries have not demonstrated such will in concrete terms. The developing countries have displayed a great deal of patience in their negotiations with the developed countries  but that patience is not limitless. The time may come when the very concept of seeking international collaboration on world economic reforms will be questioned. The consequences of such a situation may be too great  but unless positive action is taken now the world may have to face such consequences.43.	As my President stated in an address during his recent state visit to the United States:""Confrontation is not a desired strategy of the weak; but if reason  justice and dialogue all fail to bring the international changes needed to win the war against world poverty  then economic conflict is bound to follow....""The roots of OPEC""  he pointed out  ""were nourished by decades of gross price-fixing by major oil companies.""44.	The choice between dialogue and confrontation lies with those developed countries which continue to disregard the demands of the majority of the members of the international community for structural changes in economic relations between the developed and the developing countries. As my President stated on another occasion:""Dialogue or confrontation will depend upon whether the rich will recognize that the poor have a right to economic independence and will then seriously embark on the process of establishing a new relationship between the rich and the poor.""45.	On the question of disarmament we concur completely with the Secretary-General when he states that what we claim to have managed to realize as steps towards disarmament so far are  in truth  not disarmament steps at all. If we are serious about disarming  we must stop vacillating and instead proceed straight to the destruction and prohibition or further production of the most destructive weapons-the nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Any excuse today only breeds in a vicious circle another excuse tomorrow.46.	Efforts designed to move the Middle East conflict from the present stage of a precarious ""no war  no peace"" situation to a just and lasting peace in the area continue to be frustrated by Israel's continued intransigence. This is clearly manifested in Israel's consolidation of illegal settlements in occupied Arab territories  its addition of new settlements in flagrant violation of international law and in defiance of world opinion  and its persistent refusal to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people.47.	My Government's position on this question is unequivocal. Israel must withdraw from all the territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war. The national rights of the Palestinian people must be respected. These are basic prerequisites to a just and lasting peace which will guarantee the independence and security of all the States in the area. And may I add that there can be no meaningful solution if the authentic representative of the Palestinian people—the Palestine Liberation Organization-is not allowed to take part in the negotiating process aimed at resolving the conflict.48.	The unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Comoros continue to be violated through French occupation of Mayotte. It is a matter of profound concern to my Government that this situation continues despite United Nations resolutions and the efforts of the Organization of African Unity. We reiterate our call on the Government of France to respect the Comoros' unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty.49.	The non-aligned island of Cyprus continues to struggle for its territorial integrity and sovereignty against both internal and external odds. We continue to hope that the implications of the threats to that island will soon be realized and the necessary solution found. The United Nations resolutions on the question cry out for immediate implementation.50.	The legitimate goal of the Korean people for national reunification continues to be frustrated by foreign interference as evidenced by the continued presence of foreign troops in South Korea. Such interference  besides serving as a stumbling block to the reunification of the Korean nation  exacerbates tension in the area. An immediate end must be put to such interference.51.	Allow me  before turning to the issue of southern Africa  to allude briefly to a recent event of important significance. I am referring to the signing of the United States-Panama treaties on the Panama Canal. My country  which  in concert with other non-aligned countries  has consistently supported the legitimate struggle of the Panamanian people for the recovery of sovereignty over the Canal  could not but welcome this development. It is a victory for the Panamanian people. But above all it is a victory for reason and justice.52.	The question of peace  freedom and independence for Zimbabwe and Namibia  and the enjoyment of equal human and political rights in the Republic of South Africa is not  for Tanzania and for Africa as a whole  a subject detached for academic debate. It is a subject which affects us directly as free and independent States. It affects our very existence as it does affect our developmental efforts.53.	Since this Assembly met last year  there have been significant developments in the area. The armed struggle has been intensified both in Zimbabwe and in Namibia  while the resistance of the African people in South Africa has been more sharply pronounced. There has also been an intensification of the international support for and solidarity with the struggling people of southern Africa as evidenced by the Maputo International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  and the Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid.54.	But parallel to these developments  there have been some initiatives taken by some Western Powers aimed at finding a negotiated solution to the burning issues of both Zimbabwe and Namibia. We assume that these initiatives have been taken in the knowledge that the present situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security  and that the authors of the initiative are now willing and prepared to contribute effectively to the resolution of the conflict by bringing to an end the tyranny and injustice that prevails in southern Africa.55.	If our premise is correct  then we in Tanzania cannot but welcome such moves. For we have always contended and stated quite categorically that the situation prevailing in southern Africa is the direct result of the actions  and is the creation  of the Western Powers. We have used every forum to state this fact. For is it any longer arguable that both the rebel regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia and the apartheid and racist regime of John Vorster in South Africa have maintained their intransigence and defied international public opinion and pressures because of the direct and indirect support which they have been receiving from some of the Western Powers? Is it any longer debatable that denied this Western support both regimes would long since have collapsed? The white minority regimes in southern Africa have survived pressures  not because of some internal magic  but because some Western Powers have been giving them direct or indirect political  economic and military support all these years.56.	It is  therefore  logical to assume that those Western countries which are involved in taking initiatives  be it inZimbabwe or Namibia  are now prepared to follow their moves to their logical conclusion—namely  first and foremost  to deny the racist regimes the crucial support on which these regimes have relied in the past and continue to do so now.57.	And above all  these countries must also be prepared to take  in concert with the rest of the international community  both within the United Nations and outside  such measures as would effectively bring further pressure to bear on the racist and colonialist regimes. These include effective measures in the Security Council to ensure compliance with United Nations decisions. If this willingness is still not forthcoming-that is to say  if the Western Powers concerned continue to shield these regimes from the effective measures demanded by the international community—then these Powers would certainly have seriously further eroded their own credibility. It is with this background that Tanzania views the recent Anglo-American proposals on Zimbabwe and the initiative of the five Western members of the Security Council in respect to Namibia.58.	In Zimbabwe  the African people have been waging an armed struggle against the rebel regime of Ian Smith ever since 1965 when Smith illegally and unilaterally declared Rhodesia independent and instituted a reign of terror and repression with regard to the African people. The United Nations  for its part  has imposed and maintained sanctions against that regime ever since 1966. These sanctions have been openly violated by South Africa and indirectly violated by many Western Powers. Petrol and petroleum products  as well as other goods and commodities  have continued to reach Rhodesia.59.	In spite of all these odds  the African freedom fighters have continued to intensify the armed struggle and to gain great victories on the battlefield. The stage has now been reached where the initiative is in the hands of the freedom fighters and total victory is certain.60.	On our part  we have given  and we continue to give  whatever assistance we can to the nationalists and to the freedom fighters so that they can effectively wage that struggle.61.	But we have always maintained  and we continue to maintain  that an armed struggle is necessary only if it is the last resort for achieving the objective of freedom and independence in any colonial territory. For we are only too painfully aware of the costs of an armed struggle. The nationalists who fight and die  and those countries which support them  would not opt for armed struggle if the objective could be realized by means other than war. Very regrettably  all other means to achieve that objective in Zimbabwe  as the whole international community is aware  have so far failed.62.	Recently  the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States of America have put forward the Anglo-American proposals with the declared objective of attaining a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule. In the view of the Tanzania delegation  the Anglo-American proposals do not offer a solution to the Rhodesian problem. They do  however  form a sufficient basis for further negotiations  and it is with this understanding that we have welcomed Security Council resolution 415 (1977) concerning the appointment of the Secretary-General's representative.63.	Clearly  however  until negotiations have been conducted and agreement on the genuine independence of Zimbabwe has been reached  the armed struggle in Zimbabwe and the pressures against Rhodesia by the international community must not only continue  but should be intensified and be more effectively executed and implemented. In this connexion  it is essential that the United Nations should now devise means of compelling the South African regime to implement fully the sanctions against Rhodesia. A heavy responsibility lies with those Western countries which maintain economic and other relations with the South African regime.64.	There is one disturbing tendency in respect of the attitude of some Western countries  in particular those involved in the current initiatives. This element is especially manifested with regard to the question of Zimbabwe. This is their excessive- indeed almost obsessive—preoccupation with the rights of the white minority. Need we stress that what is really at issue is not the rights of minorities but the flagrant denial of the rights of the African majority.65.	A genuine solution to the problem of Zimbabwe does not lie in attempts to safeguard the privileges of the white minority. It clearly rests on the achievement of a genuine freedom and independence where all citizens  irrespective of race  colour or creed  will be treated as equals and would equally contribute to the development of their country. To overemphasize the rights of the white minority is to ignore the reality in Zimbabwe. It is to evade the fundamental challenge. For the issue is not the rights of the white minority but the rights of all Zimbabweans. We must stop making a cause celebre of those who through all these years have arrogantly defied the United Nations and ruthlessly oppressed the African people.66.	With regard to the situation in Namibia  Tanzania has noted with close interest the initiative of the five Western members of the Security Council to help bring about majority rule to Namibia. I believe  however  it is too early at this stage  to render- substantive judgement on this initiative.67.	But there are certain basic and known facts which should not be overshadowed or ignored in whatever initiatives are undertaken by the five Western countries with regard to Namibia.68.	Namibia is a United Nations Territory. In addition to its illegal occupation of the Territory  the South African regime has implanted in Namibia its abhorrent policy of apartheid.69.	The General Assembly  the Security Council and the United Nations Council for Namibia have adopted various resolutions calling on the South African regime to terminate its illegal occupation of the Territory  but to no avail. On the contrary  the regime has brought in more troops to consolidate its occupation of the Territory. It has intensified its oppression and repression of the Namibian people  and the situation has gone from bad to worse.70.	Several members of the South West Africa Peoples Organization have been arrested on framed-up charges. Others have been detained or imprisoned in South African jails. Many continue to flee from Namibia to safety in neighbouring countries.71.	What we have said for Rhodesia is also true for Namibia. South Africa has been able to defy all United Nations actions and international pressures because of the support it receives from Western Powers  principally from the five Western Powers which are now engaged in the current initiatives. These five  together with several other countries in the Western camp  have been responsible through their support to South Africa  for South Africa's refusal to comply with the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations as regards Namibia. It is thus imperative to stress that these Powers have; a particular responsibility for ensuring that South Africa complies with the decisions of the United Nations  in particular  Security Council resolution 385(1976) on Namibia. It is equally relevant to 'emphasize that they should in the future refrain from shielding South Africa in the Security Council.72.	As regards the Republic of South Africa itself  we see the situation changing for the worse rather than improving. Since June 1976  when the international community was once again brutally reminded of the meaning of apartheid by the wanton massacres of Soweto  the South African regime has intensified its reign of terror. Schoolchildren and innocent people are being arrested  detained and killed. Steve Biko is but the latest well-known victim of apartheid. Yet Biko's death does not tell the full story about apartheid and its victims. For hundreds have died and their names and their numbers will never be known by the international community.73.	When apartheid has been condemned by the whole international community as a crime against humanity  why does it continue to exist? Once again the answer must be found in the actions of those nations whose attitude and  in particular  their economic relations with South Africa  have placed priority on profits from investments over the lives of the victims of apartheid74.	Let me also stress that the perpetrators of apartheid will not be induced to change their attitudes or their system by the application of half measures. They will not change because of the verbal condemnations of their system by the Western countries. They will change only when the major Western countries cease completely all economic and military relations with the South African regime. Any collaboration with that regime means only one thing. It means the strengthening of the regime and the intensification of terror against the non-white populations. The most appropriate course of action that the Western countries can take  even at this late hour  is to impose a total arms embargo and an economic boycott of the South African regime. A mandatory arms embargo under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter is long overdue. The partners toSouth African economic prosperity should not be enraged by accusations of hypocrisy if on the one hand they condemn apartheid and on the other they refuse to support the adoption and enforcement of political  economic and military pressures against apartheid by the international community.75.	Each session of this Assembly marks lost time in arresting various dangerous trends in the world. But it also offers a new opportunity to strengthen our resolution. Our people want peace  prosperity and security. These aspirations are the linchpins of the Charter of our Organization  and our people look to the United Nations to promote them.76.	We have both the means and the capacity to solve the problems of peace  prosperity and security. All that is asked of us is that we summon the will to address them  sustain the courage to persevere on the course  and stretch the flexibility to adjust to changing perspectives. Before us  as individual leaders and individual countries  lies the challenge of problems  the honour of participation in the solution of these problems  the excitement of struggle  the promise of co-operation and the safety of success.77.	I pledge our delegation's firm commitment to the cases of forging a stronger United Nations family  on this  our one earth. "
"131",7089,"UGA",32,1977,"﻿1 Mr. President  I am delighted to have the opportunity to convey to you  and through you to all the delegations represented here  the warm greetings of His Excellency Alhaji Field Marshal Idi Amin Dada  President-for-Life of the Republic of Uganda  the Government and the entire people of Uganda and to wish you fruitful deliberations during this session.2.	It is now 15 years since Uganda was admitted as a full Member of this Organization and it is my pleasure to reaffirm my country's belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.3.	Allow me  on behalf of my delegation  to convey to you  Mr. President  our heartiest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. It is  indeed  a fitting tribute to your eminent qualities as a diplomat and statesman. Your election is also a well-deserved honour for your gallant country  with which my country  Uganda  enjoys excellent relations and which has played a leading role in the non-aligned movement. There is no doubt that with your renowned abilities you will carry out your very heavy responsibilities to the satisfaction of this Assembly  which I am certain will record great successes under your wise guidance.4.	Our congratulations go also to the officers of the General Assembly  who will be assisting you in the fulfilment of your noble duty.5.	By the same token I should like to register my sincere appreciation of the creative efforts and considerable results achieved at the last session under the guidance of the outgoing President  Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka.6.	I wish also to pay a special tribute to our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who since he began his second term of office has brought great dedication and a sense of personal commitment to his heavy task. My country has noted with appreciation the dynamism with which he has been performing his duties since the last session of the General Assembly. The role that Mr. Waldheim is playing in maintaining international peace and security and in bringing about justice and human equality among all peoples of the world has been hailed and commended by all peace-loving nations of the world.7.	1 have no doubt that you will agree with me  Mr. President  that of all the changes which have occurred in the international community since the inception of this Organization none has more profoundly changed the face of the world than the achievement of independence by those countries and peoples formerly under colonial rule. Equally you will agree with me that the process of decolonization is not yet complete  especially on the African continent. However  we can look to a day in the near future when no people or country will be under the control of any imperialist Power.8.	It is with great pleasure  therefore  that my delegation congratulates the people of Djibouti on their accession to independence. My country welcomes that new sister State from Africa to the ranks of this Assembly. Africa's determination to stamp out all vestiges of colonialism and imperialist manoeuvres has been demonstrated once again and it is now the duty of all States Members of the United Nations to give all possible assistance to this new sister State in order to preserve its political and economic independence.9.	My delegation is also very happy to see the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam take its rightful place in this universal Organization. We all recall the heroic struggle which the people of Viet Nam waged to liberate itself from the fetters of imperialist forces in order to establish a free and peaceful society. The presence of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam among us today clearly demonstrates yet another crushing political defeat inflicted upon the forces of the imperialists and reactionaries who are resentful of the political and economic independence of countries of the third world  particularly members of the non-aligned movement. It also signifies that the people will always win  irrespective of whether the enemy is a super-Power.10.	There have been many international changes since the Charter of the United Nations was drawn up in 1945. The number of Member States has increased and so have the activities of the Organization. Since the last session also there have been some changes on the international scene and new developments within this Organization which for millions of people throughout the world provides an indispensable forum in which to bring to the attention of the international community some of the problems that plague the world and for which all too often there is no apparent forum or solution. These factual changes in the life of this Organization necessitate changes in its structure. My delegation suggested during the last session that the negative vote system-more precisely  the veto—had become more distasteful to most members of this Assembly because it is incompatible with the principle of the sovereign equality of all States and gives to a few a-privileged status eclipsing the will of the majority. It is thus imperative that a more democratic and representative system be adopted so that the majority of the membership of the United Nations can play a more effective role in the Organization. I hope that at this session the General Assembly will give this question more serious consideration.11.	Since the end of the Second World War this Assembly has been preoccupied with the task of finding ways and means of freezing the proliferation of armaments  particularly nuclear armaments. Last year my delegation expressed its concern at the lack of progress in disarmament and the increased tendency towards the production  stockpiling and proliferation of armaments  particularly nuclear armaments. The arms race undertaken by rival super-Powers is a threat to world peace and security  which are of cardinal concern to our Organization.12.	It would be contrary to the aspirations of the people of the world if this Organization did not make positive moves in the field of disarmament for the maintenance of peace and security among the nations of the world. My delegation is of the strong view that the vast resources which some Members of this Organization are devoting to the production of arms should be utilized to meet the very serious problems of social and economic development of all countries  particularly the developing countries.13.	It is in the light of this that my delegation welcomes the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of disarmament. It is our hope that the special session will adopt concrete proposals for the solution of the problems regarding disarmament.14.	On the question of southern Africa we are happy that there has been increasing world concern  especially on the part of some of the big Powers which have made attempts to ensure that a negotiated settlement is found for the issues of the independence of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa. But while Uganda appreciates the current moves for finding a negotiated solution to the problems of southern Africa on the part of some countries  we have time and again made it clear that nothing short of armed struggle will save the situation in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa. This remains our view. We have taken and maintained this stand  mindful of several provocative events by the racist regime in southern Africa and their collaborators.15.	'We have taken note of the Anglo-American proposals on Zimbabwe  but we still urge caution in the handling of the issue so that the victories caused by the liberation movement are not reversed through the sweet words of the imperialists. Likewise  we maintain that the primary responsibility for the independence of Zimbabwe rests with the colonial Power  namely the United Kingdom. And nothing will convince us that the United Kingdom cannot discipline the rebel Smith if they so desire  as it has indeed done in many other countries which were former colonies of Britain and which had a more complicated situation.16.	On the other hand  the world community should not lose sight of the fact that the imperialists  after having been routed in other parts of the world  such as South-East Asia  have now turned their eyes to the African continent  especially its southern part  as the centre for their exploitation. So when we see the forces of the racist Vorster and the rebel Smith committing naked aggression against southern African States  such as Angola  Zimbabwe  Botswana and Mozambique  and when at that very time we see the imperialists uttering sweet words about a peaceful solution or a negotiated settlement for the problems of southern Africa  we become more convinced that the imperialists are just trying to buy time while they are arming the racists to the teeth with conventional as well as atomic weapons  so that they can crush the liberation movements and keep Africa safe for imperialism  or what they call Western civilization. Our appeal to Africa is this: ""Africa  keep your eyes open and be more vigilant now than ever before."" As for the liberation movements  we say: ""Do not listen to the sweet words of the imperialists and do not lay down your arms until the last enemy soldier has surrendered."" In other words  the armed struggle must continue and be intensified so that the fire Africa has started does not go out.17.	Similarly with Namibia  the atrocities that are being committed by the racist regime of Vorster must be met with increased fire  and any proposals such as those which were presented by the five Powers for a constitutional settlement must be rejected in toto. We have once before been duped by the so-called talks of the Windhoek school  talks which were meant to hoodwink the gallant Namibian people under the able leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization into accepting the obnoxious policy of bantustanization. We in Uganda are none the less happy with the new victories scored by SWAPO on the war front and hope that they redouble these efforts for the total dislodgement of the racists and the eventual establishment of a government led by the Namibian people.18.	Turning to the question of South Africa itself  my delegation would like to reaffirm our stand that Vorster has no right to deny over 18 million Africans their fundamental human rights. At the same time we appeal to the Western Powers  particularly the member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  to desist from the nuclear conspiracy that has for a long time characterized their relations with South Africa. In this spirit  we once again call upon the United Nations to consider yet again  and with greater seriousness  the question of isolating the racist regime in South Africa from the world body and its affiliated organs. Further  the United Nations must urgently impose a mandatory arms embargo on South Africa  together with economic sanctions  against the racist regime in that part of Africa. In this connexion  Uganda calls for the full implementation of the Lagos Declaration and the Programme of Action on South Africa adopted at the last session of the General Assembly.19.	As we have said before  Africa is not fighting to annihilate the white man. What Africa is fighting is oppression  injustice and the degrading and dehumanizing apartheid system imposed forcibly on our black brothers and sisters by the racist regime in South Africa.20.	Whether the racists and their collaborators like it or not the struggle for self-determination and human dignity in southern Africa will triumph in the long run. At this stage we would  however  wish to pay a tribute to all the gallant sons and daughters of Africa who have fallen in this struggle and to single out for mention the late Steven Biko  a very distinguished leader of the Azanian people  who was murdered in cold blood by the racists of South Africa. We appreciate the material and moral support that Africa has received from several friendly countries in this struggle send express the hope for increased assistance until the final victory is won.21.	The Middle East crisis remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. It is a crisis whose core has too often been overlooked. And this central issue is the rights of the Palestinian people. For this reason  the United Nations  as the custodian of peace  cannot afford to remain indifferent when the fate of a people is at stake.22.	For over two decades now  the Middle East problem has been the subject of heated and increasingly intensive debates in this Assembly  to say nothing of other international forums  such as the Organization of African Unity 10AVI and the League of Arab States. But each time  the reality and indeed the crux of the problem have been obscured  as have the essential facts of the crisis  which have been falsified by .Western and Zionist propaganda. Needless to say  the problem is essentially neither one of border arguments between Israel and the Arab States  nor one of humanitarian care for the Palestinian refugees.23.	The essence of the problem  as we see it  is that the Palestinian people have been deprived of their homeland by the Zionists and denied their right to self-determination by the expansionist regime in Israel. Against this background  the belief of my delegation is that no lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East until the rights of the Palestinians are fully restored. Furthermore  the Zionist regime must withdraw from all Arab territories occupied since the 1967 war  and adhere to all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on this matter. Time and again the United Nations has passed resolutions- calling upon Israel to withdraw unconditionally from all the Arab lands which it has occupied illegally since the 1967 war  but to no avail  because of Israel's obstinate and arrogant attitude. Indeed  Zionist Israel  supported by certain Western Powers  has virtually become a huge military arsenal threatening to wipe out the Arab peoples and threatening international peace and security. That is why the Arab peoples have taken up arms against Israel; they have no other choice. It is a choice that we in Uganda support unequivocally and we shall continue to give all our support to the struggling people of Palestine.24.	It is in the light of this that my delegation hopes and believes that this current session of the General Assembly will attach the greatest importance and urgency to this issue and adopt firm proposals  especially with regard to the continued Zionist aggression and colonial expansionism.25.	We support the declaration of the non-aligned countries  adopted at the extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries  held in New York on 30 September 1977  pledging their help and support to the struggle to recover all Arab occupied territories since 1967 and to restore the natural rights of the people of Palestine  including their right to self-determination and the right to establish their own ate on Palestinian soil  as well as the right to compensation for their property  stolen by the Zionists. We believe that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East should be held within the ambit of this declaration and that the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should participate in these negotiations  aimed at settling the Palestinian issue and the whole question of the Middle East.26.	When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in 1945  it created a world with a background of two devastating world wars in half a century. Naturally  the Charter highlighted the United Nations' quest for peace and security. The authors of the Charter were not  however  oblivious of the important role to be played by economic stability and orderly development in the world. A world divided between those who live in lavish affluence on the one hand  and those who live in abject poverty and deprivation on the other  is hardly conducive to continued peace and security. In such conditions  a time might come when those who feel condemned to perpetual poverty and suffering might think that they have nothing to lose but their misery. Then those who enjoy the luxuries of affluence might have no guarantee of their continued prosperity in peace and security.27.	The Charter of the United Nations turned the world community to the solution of economic  social and humanitarian problems  so that a better world could be evolved for the happiness of man  enabling him to live in peace  security and prosperity. However  the inclination of some Members of this Organization to maintain the world economic status quo has perpetuated the gap between the poor and the rich nations.28.	Since the United Nations was founded  its impact has been exhibited in the increased number of developing countries that have achieved political independence and joined the world community. Those countries have rightly realized that political independence without economic independence and without a fair and just share of the fruits of the world's economic development is fragile. Their solidarity  moulded out of common aspirations  has had an impact on economic relations among nations. Their just claim to share in world economic development culminated in the Declaration and Programme of Action on theEstablishment of a New International Economic Order  which emanated from the sixth special session of the General Assembly. That document  together with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the decisions of the seventh special session of the General Assembly and other relevant General Assembly resolutions  constitute an important corner-stone for the establishment among nations of new economic relations based on equality and justice.29.	The new international economic order should be the basis for the eradication of poverty  hunger  malnutrition  disease and ignorance. This new order of relationships has been strongly advocated and supported by the developing countries  having in mind the way the old economic set-up in the world has functioned; but even if the developing countries had not advocated this approach  other groups of countries would probably have advocated a change and realignment of world economic relations. Since the world community set itself on the path of establishing a new international economic order  meetings and negotiations have taken place in order to give practical effect to our aspirations. However  due to a lack of political will  mainly on the part of developed industrialized countries  little progress has been achieved towards the establishment of a fair and just economic relationship among the nations of the world. Some developed countries still want to maintain the old status quo in world economic relations.30.	The meagre results achieved so far in the establishment of the new international economic order underline the inflexibility of some developed countries in the face of fast changing world economic relations. The recent Conference on International Economic Co-operation  or North-South dialogue  in Paris points to the fact that  unless there is a reasonable accommodation to the aspirations of the majority of mankind in the world  we face a rough road ahead in our endeavours to establish fair and just economic relationships among rations.31.	The United Nations  as a universal and fully representative body  is the most appropriate forum in which global issues concerning economic development should be negotiated. We said this at the inception of the Paris negotiations and in our later statements on this issue  and the meagre results of the Paris dialogue only serve to underline our scepticism. We hope that full negotiations of this nature will be carried out within the United Nations system  where all countries are represented.32.	In this regard  my delegation would like to underline the declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the developing countries issued in New York on 29 September 1977. Unfortunately  there was no agreed assessment of the Paris dialogue at the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly. We should now bring all negotiations of a global nature under the auspices of the United Nations.33.	We should also like to reaffirm emphatically the inalienable right of the developing countries to full and permanent sovereignty over their natural resources and all their economic activities  including the right of nationalization according to their national laws. This position is in line with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Uganda's declaration of its economic war was a national expression of this right  and we have already made compensation settlements with some of the people affected. Uganda has now embarked on a three-year action programme to rehabilitate its economy.34.	As a land-locked developing country  we welcome investments in our country as long as they are in line with our laws. We also welcome assistance from the United Nations  its agencies and the world community. In this regard  we should like to underline the declaration of the Foreign Ministers previously referred to in which  among other things  that declaration urges the developed countries to pay special and urgent attention to the particular and pressing needs and requirements of the least-developed  land-locked  most seriously affected and island developing countries  and calls for the implementation within specific time-frames of the special measures and decisions adopted in their favour by the organs  organizations and other bodies of the United Nations system. To this special pronouncement by the foreign ministers of the developing countries  I should like to add the question of transit for land-locked developing countries. We hope that the Third United Nations conference on the Law of the Sea will work out a satisfactory convention safeguarding the right of access of land-locked developing countries to and from the sea.35.	As regards coercion in international trade  we welcome the declaration of the Foreign Ministers of developing countries and the iteration of their commitment to condemn  reject and resist all forms of threats or coercive and discriminatory economic policies and practices  including the imposition of restrictions on the direct or indirect transfer of advanced technology to individual or groups of developing countries by the developed countries. Any country contemplating the use of such measures  including sabotage  against my country would not only be violating the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States but would also be acting contrary to the spirit of co-operation of the developing countries as contained in the declaration of their Foreign Ministers which was adopted by acclamation in New-York on 29 September 1977.36.	Uganda attaches great importance to human settlements in the totality of development. We have closely followed the evolution of the concept of human settlements within the United Nations system and have participated actively in discussions at different levels  both nationally and within the United Nations  and in preparatory committees  culminating in the Vancouver Conference at which my country was represented at a very high level.37.	Since the Habitat Conference at Vancouver  encouraging developments on the follow-up to Habitat and the issues of institutional arrangements in the field of human settlements  have taken place. It will  however  be recalled that at its thirty-first session the General Assembly was unable to resolve sensitive issues of institutional arrangements in the field of human settlements. At that session  the General Assembly referred these issues to the sixty-third session of the Economic and Social Council  requesting the Council to take definitive decisions.38.	Despite the time  patience and talent deployed  by all members of the delegations which participated in the consultations  the Economic and Social Council was not able to reach a consensus on some issues contained in Conference Room Paper No. 8  and therefore decided  without prejudging the final position that Member States may take on the matter  to transmit the draft resolution on institutional arrangements for international co-operation in the field of human settlement to the General Assembly at the current session as a text for further negotiations. My delegation hopes that the further negotiations envisaged by the Council will be completed on the issues outstanding at the present session of the General Assembly so that the central and regional secretariats can operate and play their important role in the development of towns and villages  especially in developing countries like Uganda.39.	Before concluding  let me touch briefly on the question of refugees. Uganda has for a long time been playing host to refugees from many neighbouring countries  and we have been doing this in accordance with our traditional African hospitality. We have given the refugees land on which to settle and grow food. We have made available to them not only health care but also educational facilities for their children from the level of primary school up to that of university. In doing this  Uganda has never allowed those refugees to engage in any subversive activities against their countries of origin. Uganda has never supplied a single gun to any of them to go and attack his country of origin. In fact  their continued stay in our country is conditional on their undertaking that they will never engage in any subversive activities against their former countries. Now  while doing this  we have seen in contrast how certain countries have been shamelessly violating those elementary rules governing the stay and conduct of refugees in any country. These imperialist countries have gone even to the extent of signing agreements with the refugees according to which they would support an invasion of Uganda in return for recolonizing Uganda for at least 25 years. Knowing how hypocritical and malicious these imperialist countries are  it is not surprising to see that they are the same countries which  while engaging in subversive activities and joining hands with exiles in such criminal acts  have had the audacity of coming to this rostrum to talk about human rights. Their tears from this rostrum were nothing but crocodile tears. They were nothing but a deliberate cover- up for their diabolical plans against Uganda.40.	The real reason behind this wild campaign against Uganda is not so much the concern for human rights; it is the resentment those hypocrites have against' Uganda and in particular against the conqueror of the British Empire  President-for-Life Idi Amin Dada  who put an end to their criminal exploitation of Uganda's economy when he declared the economic war in 1972. They were so furious that they even cut off their so-called technical assistance  with immediate effect. That meant that technicians such as engineers  teachers and lecturers had to leave Uganda immediately. What is more  even doctors and nurses were ordered to leave Uganda immediately. Their calculation at that time was that Uganda's economy would collapse within three months  after which they would come back and continue their exploitation.41.	But  of course  that was nothing but day-dreaming. It is now over five years since Ugandans took full control of their economy  and today we have even more industries than we had before the declaration of economic war. Our economy is in a stronger position than ever before  our plan of action is in progress  and experts from over 50 friendly countries are working with us on various developments projects. These experts do not  of course  include the imperialist exploiters  who are preoccupied with subversive activities against Uganda.42.	Uganda has no time to waste. It is fully engaged in implementing its action programme. But if the imperialists and Zionists and their puppets attempt to interfere with this process of nation-building  Uganda will not hesitate to hit back very hard at them.43.	This leads me also to make a comment on certain unfortunate remarks voiced in this hall this morning by the representatives of certain puppet regimes. My delegation reserves the right to reply to these remarks at an appropriate time. But while reserving that right  let me say this: we in Uganda  a country which won its independence through hard struggle and which has paid  and is still paying  the price of having dared to kick out foreign exploiters through the declaration of economic war  will never allow any country or any puppet regime  for that matter  to interfere in our internal affairs in any guise.44.	If those allegations had been made by the imperialists themselves  I would have given them the fire they deserve. But since they came from a puppet  then let me say this: in Uganda we have an African proverb that  if a girl comes to you weeping and then starts accusing the boy  you should not condemn that boy before you listen to his story because you may hurt the wrong person. The imperialists and Zionists  through their press media and through their puppets  have been making wild and malicious allegations against Uganda for the reasons I outlined earlier in my statement. Now -they want to drag others into their war against Uganda in order to divert this Organization from the real issues facing it  such as the problem of southern Africa where  even now when they come and hypocritically condemn apartheid  their governments continue to invest millions of dollars with the racist regime practising apartheid and which is oppressing millions of black people. As far as I know  Uganda and Papua New Guinea are two sister countries  and I think representatives of that country should have enough courage to listen to the boy's story before they give credit to the girl's story  especially when they know that that girl is an imperialist prostitute sent to confuse this world Organization.

General debates at the sessions of the General Assembly always reflect both the positive processes in the world which are the result of concerted actions by States and contradictions and contrasts resulting from the international situation.65.	The current session of the General Assembly is no exception. What is characteristic  however  is that despite contradictions in current developments  their comprehensive analysis indicates-and this is confirmed by the content of the ongoing debate—that elements of international detente do prevail in major areas of world politics.66.	Of course  there are still several problems in the world  big and small  whose solution requires the joint efforts of States and peoples. There are also hotbeds of war which must be eliminated. But at the same time international co-operation conducive to the strengthening of the process of detente continues to develop in some major sectors.67.	The arms race continues  threatening to take on a new dimension  even though the explosive power of the lethal nuclear weapons in the world is already equivalent to many millions of bombs of the type dropped on Hiroshima. Yet at the same time the treaties and agreements that have been concluded and are now in force prove that it is possible not only to limit the arms race and bring it under control  thereby insuring international security  but also to play a certain restraining role  in many cases preventing the escalation of conflict situations.68.	The contradictions and contrasts of current developments result from the impact of various forces on world politics. The Soviet Union  the socialist community and the non-aligned movement advocate the reduction and subsequent complete removal of the danger of another war. Their objective is to eliminate existing hotbeds of war  to put an end to the arms race and to do away with the vestiges of colonialism and discrimination. It is important  too  that some influential quarters in the West  including those vested with government authority  also advocate elimination of the threat of war as a means of settling disputes between States. Differences in world outlook do not impede their joint actions with socialist countries  and that must certainly be welcomed.69.	The strengthening of the foundations of peace could proceed even more confidently but for the opposition of imperialist and reactionary forces in the West which do not wish to reconcile themselves to the failure of their attempts to dictate their will to the peoples or to intimidate those who desire social changes. The Peking leaders have actually long since joined hands with these arch-reactionary forces of imperialism and are running in the same harness. They are opposed to the policy of peace  detente and disarmament  and they have assumed the shameful role of preaching the inevitability of another war. These gentlemen are not loath to use even the United Nations rostrum for their purposes  as was illustrated by the recent statement made at the 13th meeting by the head of the Chinese delegation. We strongly reject the filthy insinuations and slander of the speaker from Peking.70.	No one will be able to shake our commitment to the peace-loving policy. The Land of Soviets  which this year celebrates the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution  has for 60 years been loyal to a policy of peace. That policy  which expresses the political will of all Soviet peoples and is in the interests of the peoples of the entire world  has been steadily developed and enriched from the issuing of the Decree of Peace to the adoption of the Programme of Peace by the twenty-fourth and twenty- fifth Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its current implementation. Socialism needs peace and creates and defends it  and therein lies its greatest humaneness. That is its greatest benefit. ""The strengthening of peace is one of the most important guarantees of man's greatest right—the right to life""  said the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Mr. L. I. Brezhnev  whose name is justly Jinked with successes achieved in the field of detente. A great deal has indeed been done in this field  and is duly appreciated by many statesmen and politicians and by world public opinion. As we all know  this has also been noted on more than one occasion in the United Nations.71.	Of great importance to the cause of peace and international security is the joint declaration by the Soviet Union and France on international detente signed on 22 June last  a document specifically and fully dedicated to this most important international process. The viability of the policy of detente has also been confirmed by the successful preparations for the Belgrade meeting of representatives of the States which participated in the Helsinki Conference  which has just begun in the capital of Yugoslavia. However  the current situation in the world as a whole and in certain parts of it does not give grounds for belief that international detente is growing spontaneously without running into obstacles.72.	Here we should like to draw attention to the fact that the opponents of detente in the West have recently engaged in everything from misinformation to slander and intimidation to ""prove"" that there allegedly exists a Soviet ""military threat"" and that the socialist countries ""violate human rights"" and the like  while under cover of this campaign new steps are being taken in the arms race  the solution of pressing international problems is being foiled and the policy of international detente is being undermined.73.	All this confirms that it is necessary for States to make further joint efforts  backed by the authority of the UnitedNations  to overcome the resistance to detente  to consolidate its principles and persistently to weave them into the fabric of international life. This need is fully and completely met by the proposal of the Soviet Union on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and the prevention of the danger of nuclear war  submitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Mr. A. A. Gromyko  for consideration by the current session of the General Assembly 74.	The adoption of the Draft Declaration on the Deepening and Consolidation of International Detente and the draft resolution on the prevention of the danger of nuclear war  we are confident  be conducive to overcoming the barriers that have been put up or are being put up by those who oppose detente. Without a doubt that would strengthen the favourable climate in international relations  help to build an atmosphere of trust and develop all-round co-operation between countries and peoples  and have a positive effect on the activities of the United Nations. The adoption of the draft declaration would reaffirm the will and determination of States Members of the United Nations to promote further international detente and would politically isolate those forces which seek to revive the spirit-of the ""cold war"" and animosity in international affairs. The immediate implementation of steps leading to prevention of the danger of nuclear war-and this is highlighted in the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet Union-is becoming particularly important for the strengthening of peace.75.	The adoption of the Soviet proposals could help achieve a break-through in limiting the arms race and in disarmament. As we all know  the problems of curbing the arms race and achieving disarmament have always been a central concern of the peoples and Governments of most countries  many international agencies and organizations  and  above all  the United Nations. And that is no accident  for the strengthening of peace and international security depends in many ways on the solution of these problems.76.	At the current stage of international relations we can no longer speak of disarmament in general terms. The language in which we discuss this subject must be the language of constructive and business like proposals leading to practical action.77.	The specific proposals of the Soviet Union intended to put a speedy end to the arms race and achieve disarmament are well known. They were announced to the whole world as the most important task of Soviet foreign policy from the rostrum of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the report of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Comrade L. I. Brezhnev. Those proposals were set forth in great detail and substantiated in the memorandum of the Soviet Union on questions of the cessation of the arms race and on disarmament submitted to the General Assembly at its last session.5 The latest Soviet proposal submitted at this session demonstrates once again the desire of the Soviet State to break the deadlock in the solution of acute disarmament problems and to provide fresh momentum to this process.78.	In conditions where nuclear weapons pose the greatest danger to mankind it is absolutely justified that the United Nations should concentrate its attention primarily on the problem of the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and their destruction. A preliminary and essential step in this direction should be the prohibition of all nuclear weapons tests; this would impede the further improvement of weapons of mass destruction  make the atmosphere on earth healthier both literally and. figuratively and substantially facilitate the achievement of an agreement banning nuclear weapons. The Soviet draft treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests could become a basis for working out an appropriate international agreement. The search for agreement on the question of control has now been made much easier. At the current session of the General Assembly an important statement was made regarding the Soviet Union's readiness for the treaty on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests to be signed initially by the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics  the United States and the United Kingdom. Thus  one more step has been taken towards completing the preparation of the treaty and towards its entry into force. Members of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and participants in the sessions of the General Assembly have  on more than one occasion  expressed themselves in favour of such a step. It is proposed that  having signed the treaty  the three nuclear Powers should refrain from carrying out underground tests of nuclear weapons during a certain period of time. Meanwhile  the remaining nuclear Powers should  in actual deeds and not just in words  prove the sincerity of their intention to start moving towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons. It is evident that nuclear weapons tests will be completely prohibited only when all the nuclear Powers become parties to the treaty. It goes without saying that the implementation of the Soviet Union's proposals will constitute one more barrier to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and push back somewhat the threat of nuclear catastrophe hanging over mankind. We call on all States Members of the United Nations  and above all  all the nuclear Powers  to begin to implement the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapons tests.79.	Further  while noting with satisfaction that a certain degree of progress has been achieved in the Soviet-American talks and in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament on banning chemical weapons  we express the hope that the elaboration of the draft of the relevant document will be accelerated.80.	In the light of recent events the proposal of the Soviet Union  endorsed by the General Assembly  to ban the development and production of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons has become even more urgent than ever before. The reports on the development of new types of weapons of mass destruction  including the neutron bomb  make that Soviet initiative extremely important. They confirm that the danger of the emergence of new types of weapons of mass destruction  far from being hypothetical  as some try toargue  is  on the contrary  a real danger  whereas contrived objections to this proposal create in fact an atmosphere propitious for research into new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and for their development. The United Nations and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should speed up the preparation of the relevant agreement on this question so as to block this new channel of the arms race at its very source.81.	As is well known  a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament will be convened in May and June of next year. We believe it should make a significant contribution to the search for approaches to solving the problem of containing the arms race and of disarmament  and determine the main areas of activity of States in this matter. It is our belief that that session can and must become an important milestone on the road leading to the convening of a World Disarmament Conference.82.	We believe that despite the sheer complexity of disarmament problems man's intelligence will find a way to solve them.83.	There are several items on the agenda of the General Assembly whose solution would help to strengthen international security in accordance with the Declaration adopted by the United Nations in 1970. We express the conviction that the current session will proceed with the preparation of a treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. This will be of invaluable importance for the strengthening of international security.84.	A settlement of the protracted conflict in the Middle East  where the situation remains explosive as a result of the expansionist acts of Israel  has long been overdue. What is needed here is a speedy convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  which cannot be replaced by any ""working groups"" or by any similar separate steps. Of course  the Palestine Liberation Organization-the recognized representative of the Arab people of Palestine- must naturally take part in all phases of the negotiations at the Geneva Conference.85.	We strongly support the just stand taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the matter of the independent  peaceful reunification of Korea and demand that the resolution of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea be implemented. Fresh efforts are also needed to resolve the problem of Cyprus where tensions still persist.86.	And  clearly enough  the interests of the further strengthening of international security call for the elimination of the vestiges of colonialism in all their manifestations.87.	Colonialism is putting up stiff resistance  trying to weaken the ranks of those who are fighting against colonialist oppression and to sow discord and enmity among them. What is urgently required here is unity of action of all anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist forces for the speedy and complete elimination of the vestiges of colonialism.88.	And here the statement made by the Soviet Union at this session to the effect that the complete elimination of the vestiges of colonialism  racism and apartheid is urgent is particularly important. That is the logical continuation of the initiative of the Soviet Union which led to the adoption in 1960 of the Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.89.	Now that colonialism has been crushed  though not totally eliminated  its vestiges  while poisoning the international atmosphere  constitute a dangerous source of tensions and conflicts. This is evidenced by the situation in southern Africa. The moves by the racist and colonialist regimes of the Republic of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  which have elevated to the status of national policy flagrant mass violations of human rights and liberties  such as terror  violence and repression  against the indigenous African population of the Republic of South Africa  Zimbabwe and Namibia  and which systematically carry out acts of aggression against independent African States  have brought about a situation in that part of the world which poses a direct threat to peace and international security. All these developments have become possible thanks to the support and actual encouragement of the colonialist and racist regimes in southern Africa by certain Western Powers which camouflage their policy by ""initiatives"" allegedly aimed at a peaceful solution of the problems existing in that area. In doing so  they are acting according to a very strange logic indeed. They started by arming the South African racists and continue to do so at present; yet now they are calling on the liberation movements to lay down their arms. Their aim is clear: to gain time in order to make the racist regimes look more benign  to preserve the domination of monopolies and to extinguish the flame of the liberation struggle of the peoples  which are laying siege to the criminal bastions of racism and colonialism on the African continent. Notwithstanding all this  objective conditions now exist for a real solution to the problem of southern Africa.90.	Problems of economic development occupy an important place in the agenda of the current session.91.	Despite some positive changes in a number of areas  the economies of most developing countries remain in dire straits. Within the world capitalist economic system  their exploitation is being intensified while existing trade barriers remain and new ones are being created within that system. Transnational corporations continue to export an increasingly greater share of their profits while trampling upon the right of developing countries to be masters of their natural resources; the latter are made to carry on their shoulders the burden of recessionary trends in the so-called market economies. What is more  illusions are being spread among the developing countries to the effect that they can strike a bargain with those who exploit them and that of order to overcome their backwardness  they have to follow the laws of a society based on exploitation.92.	The system of international economic relations dating back to the colonial period has come into direct conflict with the vital interests of the overwhelming majority of countries and with the over-all international situation. The restructuring of those relations on a democratic basis and the elimination of discrimination  diktat and inequality are among the major demands of the modern day.93.	There is no doubt that the process of resolving the most pressing social and economic problems of the developing countries and the less developed areas as a whole and meeting their social and cultural needs will gain in momentum as peaceful coexistence and international detente become the rule of international communication and acquire a general and irreversible character.94.	The question of respect for human rights occupies an important place in our debate. The problem of ensuring human rights is the problem of creating conditions required for the free development of all peoples in an atmosphere of peace and the comprehensive  harmonious development of every individual. The achievement of this momentous task  inspired by the noble ideas of humanism  had of course nothing to do with political intrigues and sterile propagandists rhetoric.95.	The anti-Soviet campaign unleashed in certain Western countries under the pretext of ""protecting human rights"" is in fact aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of our State and is aimed against the rights won by the Soviet peoples in their revolutionary struggle and consolidated in a society of advanced socialism. Paradoxically though  it would appear that this campaign is being waged by the apologists of a society where human rights are constantly being trampled upon—every day  every hour.96.	Sixty years ago unemployment  social and national oppression  inequality  poverty  want and illiteracy were the lot of all peoples of tsarist Russia  including the Ukrainian people.97.	The Great October Socialist Revolution for the first time in history did away with exploitation  national inequality and enmity and placed all spheres of social activity at the service of man  establishing in practice the great principle that the free development of every individual is a pre-condition for the free development of all. This principle has been expressed in the new Soviet Constitution. The new Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is now in preparation and will reflect the achievements of the Ukrainian people which will mark the sixtieth anniversary of Soviet power in the Ukraine in December of this year.98.	The enormous historical advantages of the socialist way of life  its outstanding features such as collectivism and comradeship  friendship among all nations and nationalities  sound morals and social optimism  stand out most vividly against the crisis in which the society advertised by Western ideologists finds itself. As stressed by a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR  Mr. Shcherbitsky:""Our way of life is a model for new types of relations among people  nations and nationalities  based on lofty and noble principles. It is an example of everlasting international significance.""99.	The people's quest for peace is irresistible and this is one of the sure factors that guarantee further deepening of international detente. The United Nations can play an important role in this endeavour. And we hope that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly will make a worthy contribution to the solution of problems which  are of paramount importance for the future of all mankind. This is what the peoples of the world expect from it. First and foremost  they demand that the arms race be ended and all its concomitant evils done away with. Let the resources of the world be channelled not to death but to the attainment of happiness  well-being and social progress for all peoples. "
"133",7181,"URY",32,1977,"﻿156.	 Mr. President  I should like to take this opportunity to offer you my congratulations on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. Your election not only represents a tribute to you personally but also does honour to your country  Yugoslavia  with which Uruguay has maintained cordial relations for many years.157.	On behalf of my delegation  I should also like to hail the accomplishments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and in that connexion to lay particular emphasis on his enduring concern for the political and economic problems of the developing countries.158.	Thirty-two years ago  we  the peoples of the United Nations  resolved ... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small  to establish conditions under which justice and respect for ... treaties ... can be maintained  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom  and... to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours ... .Since that time  those high aspirations have represented the focal-point of our endeavours and the hope of our peoples. The balance-sheet of achievements to date would show important gains on the credit side  but on the debit side it would draw attention to much that remains to be done.159.	Notwithstanding the lapse of time and the work accomplished  the world is at present living in the midst of crisis which is both moral and material; it is sick not only in spirit but also in the state of its economy. As was the case 32 years ago  the anxious eyes of the whole world are once again focused on those same high goals and objectives for national and international well-being and on the practical results flowing from our deliberations and our work-because there is no other reality or dream of which they can take hold.160.	As on other occasions  the present session will permit us to measure the throb of the political realities faced by countries  as set forth by their heads of delegation. This shows clearly that this United Nations forum continues to be universally recognized as representing the best hope for the resolution of conflicts and antagonisms  for encouraging closer and more productive relations among nations  and for promoting mutually beneficial international co-operation in the economic and social fields. That was the hope of our predecessors when they signed the historic Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco.161.	Therefore let us not be diverted from that hope or that struggle because we will vitiate what has been achieved to date and compromise everything that remains to be done. Let us rather dedicate ourselves anew to all that yet remains to be done. That is surely our first and heaviest present responsibility  and it can be neither diluted nor dodged. We are starting this new session in the belief that acute problems are looming which place in jeopardy the long and arduous work of our Organization for the achievement of peace and justice in the international community and that solutions to those problems must be found if the Organization's goals and objectives are to be attained.162.	I should like to refer briefly to the most important of those problems which can be solved only through the participation of all in collective and concerted action.163.	Until a more healthy and just economy can be guaranteed  it will not be possible for the world to achieve lasting stability and peace. It was therefore encouraging to learn from the declaration of the Heads of State of the principal developed countries at the Downing StreetSummit Conference in London last May that the world economy could only achieve sustained and even growth provided the less industrialized countries participated therein  in so far as the well-being of the developing and the developed is interlinked as world prosperity is a single and indivisible whole. Even a superficial analysis shows  however  that the practical progress achieved during the past year is not consistent with the proposals for reform implicit in those declarations.164.	In reality  North-South relations continue to be of marginal interest to the advanced countries  except as regards the supply of certain important raw materials  such as petroleum. As Uruguay has pointed out in the past  substantial differences of approach remain  sad they prevent effective progress towards satisfactory solutions.165.	In the opinion of Uruguay  the North-South dialogue cannot neglect the grave problems of the middle-income developing countries  whose efforts to achieve more satisfactory growth rates and living standards for their populations have been thwarted by recent changes in the world economy  by the reality of international trade bristling with useless barriers  and by the inexcusable lack of financial assistance.166.	The developing countries—as much as or  indeed  more than any others—stand in need of a properly functioning international system organized on just foundations which will not prejudice their sustained economic growth but will assist them to exploit their own material and human resources.167.	Uruguay has launched a vigorous effort to open up its economy with a view to overcoming the rigid limitations within the domestic market. It- has accordingly lowered substantially the protective barriers against imports and is at the same time trying to promote exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured products in which it enjoys a competitive advantage; it has achieved conspicuous success with a number of those product lines.168.	Unfortunately  it is becoming increasingly evident that that effort is running into the strongest opposition  in the form of proliferating and constantly increasing protectionist measures in the principal world markets.169.	There is much talk about the advantages of free trade. Such proclamations become a mockery when the structure of 'production and trade in a sector of such importance to humanity as agriculture-in which the natural advantages of the developing countries offer the possibility of optimum efficiency levels—is constantly distorted and shackled by the developed countries through a multiplicity of practices  which in effect negates free trade.170.	Today more than ever the world food problem cannot be solved by stimulating expensive agricultural production in certain developed countries behind tariff and non-tariff barriers  subsidies and support prices  as the need will arise at a later stage to dispose of the agricultural surpluses thus encouraged  through the use of  dumping  prices and even  on occasion  by unilaterally labelling them as development assistance. Instead of alleviating the world food problem  such actions aggravate it by disorganizing markets and by interfering with the growth of the productive capacity of the developing countries in an area in which they have a clear comparative advantage.171.	While the developing countries are faced with the daily threat of protectionist barriers  the dialectics unleashed within the framework of the North-South dialogue are of little relevance.172.	The developing countries are seriously handicapped by the present lack of rules which would take proper account of their situation and which would be respected by the industrialized nations. The developed countries are protected by their economic weight against the protectionist designs of their trading partners. Their capacity for retaliation represents an effective deterrent. But this factor is of no help to the great majority of the developing countries which can do little or nothing to defend themselves but nevertheless risk becoming proving-grounds for the protectionist experiments of the developed countries.173.	Uruguay supports the international organization of production and trade in raw materials in accordance with an integrated programme which would take account of development targets  and also the establishment of a common fund which would serve as a fundamental instrument for achieving those goals.174.	The restructuring of the world financial system should also be designed to assist development and in particular should make it free from all political considerations  bearing in mind that by their very nature the latter should be kept separate from financial programmes.175.	The events of recent years have had a serious impact on the developing countries  which have been damaged by the loss of stability in exchange rates and by the abandonment in practice of the prohibition on competitive devaluations  without gaining offsetting advantages from the creation of international liquidity.176.	The creation of international reserves should correspond to the needs of real  potential and non-inflationary growth of production and world trade; but above all it should serve the overriding objective of stimulating development.177.	At this point it is relevant to mention that one of the major defects of the North-South dialogue is rooted in the apparently intentional lack of co-operation shown by a substantial group of countries in this particular area.178.	The problem of development concerns not only the Western world  and attempts to make it appear so must be firmly rejected. The economic structure of the socialist countries does not represent a real obstacle to their participation in efforts to assist development  in the same way as a state monopoly of trade cannot reasonably hinder support to such efforts.179.	The international community should not accept with passive indifference that one group of nations should adhere to commercial practices in their dealings with the developing countries while  at the same time  justifying severe condemnation of the same practices when applied by market-economy countries.180.	To the extent that their present commercial practices force the developing countries to remain suppliers of natural raw materials from whom no products containing any added value are purchased  the developed socialist countries are placing obstacles in the way of the development of the industrially less advanced countries and are hurting the living standards of their inhabitants.181.	There is no question but that drastic action must be taken on such questions as the burden of debt of the developing countries  the maintenance of the purchasing power of their export earnings  as well as in matters of trade  industrialization  agriculture  food  the transfer of technology  the restructuring of raw material markets  the negotiation of the Integrated Programme and the common fund  development assistance and the fight against inflation.182.	The list of economic questions to which I have just referred makes it imperative that efforts should be continued which will test the efficacy of the present economic system of the United Nations as the principal forum for negotiations in the North-South dialogue.183.	International terrorism continues to present a grave threat. A few months ago Uruguay took part in the most recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism  and it is a matter of regret that no common political will could be found to face up to this modern scourge of humanity.184.	As the representative of a country which endured more than its share of terrorist violence and which saw the traditional values of an open  united and democratic society threatened by it  I believe that our Organization should express its collective and most energetic repudiation of such hate-inspired forms of aggression and should encourage universal respect for law and order.185.	If all nations do not co-operate in the observance of those principles  then disintegration and chaos will rule society with all their terrible consequences  and the United Nations will suffer a severe blow to its prestige  already weakened by the vacillations of many Members  and even by the covert or open support given by others to those who commit terrorist acts.186.	Even the most noble cause of the liberation of peoples is tainted when recourse is had to certain repugnant forms of violence which  in the main  strike down innocent people  and represent a flagrant violation of human rights and of those other goals and objectives of our Organization which I mentioned earlier.187.	Uruguay has always been a strong supporter of human rights and  from the early days of the United Nations  has striven to find the most effective means of implementing the provisions of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Uruguay accordingly proposed the establishment of a truly international legal body which would advise on all cases of violations of human rights and would set up a consultative mechanism to prevent unlawful interference or intervention. That proposal  submitted more than 20 years ago  was later taken up by Costa Rica which  using the same principles as a basis  gave it the new form of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Uruguay  together with Costa Rica-known for its clear humanist principles-has continued work on this idea which  although it could not be implemented  nevertheless remains alive  and we give it our renewed support.188.	Notwithstanding this background  we have in recent years been the object of an international campaign of slander which sought to pervert the meaning of the crisis which beset our country in such a way as to give the impression that the framework of one of the exemplary societies in matters of social justice and respect for human rights had been fundamentally changed.189.	On that point  I would like to state that Uruguay was forced to carry out a hard struggle against subversion and foreign intervention without the slightest support from even the traditional allies of the free world.190.	Today the skies are clearing and our Republic is on the road back to full institutional normality following a period when overriding reasons of necessity and emergency forced us to take certain temporary measures as an unavoidable duty of national survival.191.	We were  and continue to be  the only actors in a drama involving the defence of our national character in which we are not prepared to admit either foreign admonitions or ideas. In the field of human rights we have  with a great effort  maintained a normal dialogue in which we have always played the role of inspirer and active participant.192.	In maintaining and increasing the degree of protection for human rights-which never lost their force in Uruguay—and in correcting unavoidable short-comings  the members of my Government have the moral support of their own consciences and their incorruptible sense of responsibility.193.	At the same time Uruguay takes a firm stand of principle against the politicization of the issue of human rights and is opposed to any attempt-no matter from what quarter-to employ it as an excuse for interference in the internal affairs of States and  in particular  in their political process or as a form of aggression against their sovereignty  independence or integrity.194.	Full respect for fundamental human rights and liberties must be completely independent of the internal procedures of States and of systems they may have found it necessary to adopt within the limits of their respective sovereignty.195.	Protection for those rights and liberties represents an international obligation of binding character and therefore  under international law  it is the responsibility of every State  within the area of its exclusive authority  to adopt such measures as it may find appropriate to implement its international obligations in this as in any other matter.196.	Uruguay also categorically confirms its traditional principles in so far as it does not accept discrimination- whether racial or otherwise—no matter what reasons are used in justification or in what regions they may be practised.197.	The difficult situation in the Middle East is a matter of special concern to my Government as its excessive prolongation threatens peace and international security.198.	My delegation has taken the opportunity of expressing Uruguay's views on this problem during other sessions of the General Assembly  and I would like to repeat these today.199.	From a purely legal point of view  it is clear that military victory confers no rights and  still less  territorial rights. Accordingly  the community of nations accepts the principle that each has the right to live in peace  within secure and recognized borders  enjoying respect for its existence  sovereignty  integrity and independence.200.	In any examination of the over-all problem of the Middle East  account must be taken  both on political and human grounds  of the fate of the Palestinian people  and formulas must be found within the framework of the peace negotiations which will secure their legitimate aspirations.201.	We believe that those directly interested should  as soon as possible  negotiate appropriate and just understandings based on the principles of international law with a view to finding a comprehensive solution to this question  so that finally a fully adequate peace agreement can be achieved in this area.202.	The agenda of the present session contains more than 20 items on disarmament  on which the General Assembly has in the past expressed its views.203.	It seems to us that the peoples of the world are under the impression that disarmament is exclusively a subject for rhetoric which they support as a matter of course as a. worthy cause  whereas the reality is that  with the passage of time and contrary to what might be hoped  armaments of an increasingly sophisticated and deadly nature are escalating in all regions of the globe.204.	For a variety of reasons  vast amounts of the incomes of States and -the resources of mankind are poured into the stockpiling of means of destruction  while millions of human beings are dying in the streets for lack of food and while others exist in subhuman conditions for lack of proper integral development.205.	It is urgently necessary in this field as in others to achieve solid results which will not only serve to maintain international peace and security but will permit us to continue to speak with moral authority and to rely upon the confidence of our peoples on an item so perverted by reality.206.	If within the framework of known strategic concepts the maintenance of international peace and security has hitherto depended on an equilibrium of force or power of an assumed permanence dictated by the technical and scientific advances of our era  it is surely time to buttress this equilibrium with more solid support  while renouncing—in a sincere and tangible form—all designs aimed at domination  conquest and political expansion. Such a course of action would not only have favourable repercussions on the different items which together represent the field of disarmament but it would also free vast potential resources in every country of the world  for the creation of entire societies-more just and happier in character-to the benefit of peoples and the whole of humanity.207.	Our Organization is at present making preparations for the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  to which we  as a small nation  give special importance.208.	In this regard I wish to reaffirm the function of law as a fundamental factor in the agreements which are to be studied and adopted next year. I speak not only of law as an abstract; technical formula but also of its essential corollary: the implementation of international justice through its highest tribunal  the International Court of Justice.209.	Uruguay has repeatedly confirmed its international role  which has always been based on those principles and  more than 50 years ago  it was the first country to accept without reservations the jurisdiction of the then Permanent Court of International Justice. Faithful to those principles   my country will strive to ensure that the Court is given the primary function of resolving the problems which will flow from future agreements in the field of disarmament.210.	I have already referred to many important matters which  in our opinion  still require to be faced or resolved if we are to achieve a just and peaceful international community  but I would be ignoring the realities of the international situation if I failed to mention the positive steps which have been taken by Member States in the pursuit of the known and well-defined purposes of our Organization in the field of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the revision of treaties sanctifying unjust situations. I am referring in particular to the Treaties on the Panama Canal  recently agreed upon between a brother country of Latin America and the United States of America.211.	My Government takes particular pleasure in the agreement reached between the parties in so far as—with the blessing of the whole international community—it has brought to an end one of the historical disputes of this hemisphere  as was also the case with the Treaty on the River Plate between my country and the Argentine Republic. Faith in dialogue between States  in peaceful solutions and in justice has thus been reconfirmed.212.	We hope that other pending questions will soon be resolved  such as the granting of access to the sea to Bolivia  the situation in the Malvinas and the question of Belize.213.	My Government attaches special importance to the forthcoming seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and believes that it represents a decisive step in the process of building the new juridical order which will regulate the activities of States.214.	My Government also attaches particular importance to the establishment of the exclusive economic zone and the new institution to be established under the law of the sea. This will not follow the classic pattern  as the area in question is neither territorial sea nor high sea and is therefore to be placed under a special legal system.215.	I should like to emphasize that any text which hopes to be successful must be based on the sui generis nature of the exclusive economic zone. This special juridical character represents the fair balance between all the legitimate rights and interests involved.216.	The coexistence of sovereign rights and exclusive jurisdiction  on the one hand  and of liberties and related rights  on the other  calls for a special system in which both groups of interest must be given clear guarantees  with a precise distribution of the related residuary rights; this system must completely clarify this new formulation of the sovereignty-liberty equation  always within the framework of basic institutions of the law of the sea.217.	The integrated text for purposes of negotiation which was put together during the sixth session of the Conference  without prejudice to the reservations called for by certain of its provisions  represents an acceptable basis for continuing negotiations towards the conclusion of a draft convention.218.	Having said that  I would like to repeat that it is the decision of my Government to encourage the building of peaceful order on the oceans.219.	I hope that the concrete examples I have cited will serve as a stimulus and as a source of inspiration in the future as we face the serious problems menacing the international community. Some of them call for speedy clarification. I am referring in particular to such problems as international subversion and terrorism  racial discrimination  the international economic order and the situations which have developed in the Middle East and in southern Africa.220.	If  as I believe  we continue to have sufficient will to maintain international peace and security  we must confront those problems immediately  in all sincerity and understanding  remembering that mankind  notwithstanding differences  is  in our era  increasingly reluctant to tolerate injustice in any form.221.	Before leaving this rostrum  allow me to express the sentiments of the Uruguayan people by paraphrasing the words of our illustrious Rodo: I leave here my ardent prayer that the symbol of the United Nations will rise in ever more serene skies; that its splendour will illuminate ever purer glories  ever wiser laws  ever more abundant crops  more freedom and greater happiness; and that  shedding its light on the permanent harmony which flows from love and justice  it will maintain for current and future generations of humanity a better  more beautiful and a greater order than any that the world has hitherto seen form and dissolve as the centuries roll on.

"134",7228,"USA",32,1977,"﻿1.	 Mr. President  I wish to offer you my congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. It gives my own Government particular satisfaction to work under the leadership of a representative of Yugoslavia  a nation with which the United States enjoys close and valued relations. We pledge our co-operation and we will depend heavily on your experience and skill in guiding these discussions which we are beginning.2.	I should like also to express again the high esteem in which we hold Secretary-General Waldheim. We continue to benefit greatly from our close consultations with him and we place great trust in his leadership of this Organization.3.	Thirty-two years ago  in the cold dawn of the atomic age  this Organization came into being. Its first and most urgent purpose has been to tenure peace for an exhausted and ravaged world.4.	Present conditions in some respects appear quite hopeful  yet the assurance of peace continues to elude us. Before the end of this century a score of nations could possess nuclear weapons. If this should happen the world we leave our children will mock our own hopes for peace.5.	The level of nuclear armaments could grow by tens of thousands and the same situation could well occur with advanced conventional weapons  The temptation to use those weapons  or fear that someone else might do it first  would be almost irresistible. The ever-growing trade in conventional arms subverts international commerce from a force for peace to a caterer for war.6.	Violence  terrorism  assassination and undeclared wars all threaten to destroy the restraint and the moderation that must become the dominant characteristic of our age. Unless we establish a code of international behaviour in which the resort to violence becomes increasingly irrelevant to the pursuit of national interests we will crush the world's dreams for human development and the full flowering of human freedom.7.	We have already become a global community  but only in the sense that we face common problems and share  for good or evil  a common future. In this community  the power to solve the world's problems  particularly economic and political power  no longer lies solely in the hands of a few nations. Power is now widely shared among many nations with different cultures  different histories and different aspirations. The question is whether we will allow our differences to defeat us or whether we will work together to realize our common hopes for peace.8.	Today I want to address the major dimensions of peace and the role the United States intends to play in limiting and reducing all armaments  controlling nuclear technology  restricting the arms trade and settling disputes by peaceful means.9.	When atomic weapons were used for the first time Winston Churchill described the power of the atom as  a revelation long mercifully withheld from man . Since then we have learned  in Durrenmatt’s chilling words  that  what has once been thought can never be unthought .10.	If we are to have any assurance that our children will live out their lives in a world which satisfies our hope—or that they will have a chance to live at all-we must finally come to terms with this enormous nuclear force and turn it to exclusively beneficial ends. Peace will not be assured until the weapons of war are finally put away. While we work towards that goal nations will want sufficient arms to preserve their security. The United States purpose is to ensure peace. It is for that reason that our military posture and our alliances will remain as strong as necessary to deter attack.11.	However  the security of the global community cannot for ever rest on a balance of terror. In the past  war has been accepted as the ultimate arbiter of disputes among nations  but in the nuclear era we can no longer think of war as merely a continuation of diplomacy by other means. Nuclear war cannot be  measured by the archaic standards of  victory  or  defeat . This stark reality imposes on the United States and the Soviet Union an awesome and special responsibility.12.	The United States is engaged along with other nations in a broad range of negotiations. In Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  we and the Soviets are within sight of a significant agreement in limiting the total numbers of weapons and in restricting certain categories of weapons of special concern to each of us. We can also start the crucial process of curbing the relentless march of technological development which makes nuclear weapons ever more difficult to control.13.	We must look beyond the present  and work to prevent the critical threats and instabilities of the future. If the principles of self-restraint  reciprocity and mutual accommodation of interests are observed  then the United States and the Soviet Union not only will succeed in limiting weapons but also will create r foundation for better relations in other spheres of interest.14.	The United States is willing to go as far as possible  consistent with our security interests  in limiting and reducing our nuclear weapons. On a reciprocal basis we are willing now to reduce them by 10 per cent  20 percent or even 50 per cent  Then we will work for further reductions with a view to a world truly free of nuclear weapons.15.	The United States also recognize the threat of continued testing of nuclear explosives.16.	Negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions are now being conducted by the United States  the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. As in other areas where vital nation J security interests are engaged  agreements must be verifiable and fair. They must be seen by all the parties as serving a longer-term interest that justifies the restraints of the moment. The longer-term interest in this instance is to close one more avenue of nuclear competition and thereby demonstrate to all the world that the major nuclear Powers take seriously our obligations to reduce the threat of nuclear catastrophe.17.	My country believes that the time has come to end all explosions of nuclear devices  no matter what their claimed justification—peaceful or military-and we appreciate the efforts of other nations to reach this same goal.18.	During the past nine months  I have expressed the special importance we attach to controlling nuclear proliferation; but I fear that many do not understand why the United States feels as it does. Why is it so important to avoid the chance that one or two or 10 other nations might acquire one or two or 10 nuclear weapons of their own? Let me try to explain  for I deeply believe that this is one of the greatest challenges that we face in the next quarter of a century.19.	It is a truism that nuclear weapons are a powerful deterrent. They are a deterrent because they threaten. They could be used for terrorism or blackmail as well as for war. But they threaten not just the intended enemy; they threaten every nation—combatant and non-combatant alike. That is why all of us must be concerned.20.	Let me be frank. The existence of nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union  and in the United Kingdom  France and China  is something we cannot undo except by the painstaking process of negotiation. But the existence of these weapons does not mean that other nations need to develop their own weapons  any more than it provides a reason for those of us who have them to share them with others. Rather it imposes two solemn obligations on the nations which have the capacity to export nuclear fuels and nuclear technologies-the obligation to meet legitimate energy needs and  in doing so  the obligation to ensure that nothing we export contributes  directly or indirectly  to the production of nuclear explosives. That is why the supplier nations arc seeking a common policy  and that is why the United States and the Soviet Unions even as we struggle to find common ground in the SALT talks  have already moved closer towards agreement and co-operation in our efforts to limit nuclear proliferation.22. I believe that the London suppliers group must conclude its work as it is presently constituted  so that world security will be safeguarded from the pressures of commercial competition. We have learned that it is not enough to safeguard just some facilities or some materials. Full-scope  comprehensive safeguard ire necessary.23 . Two weeks from now  in our own country  more than SO supplier and consuming nations will convene in Washington for the Conference on International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation which we proposed last spring. For the next several years experts will work together on every facet of the nuclear fuel cycle. The scientists and the policy-makers of these nations will face a tremendous challenge.  We know that  by the year 2000  nuclear power reactors could be producing enough plutonium to make tens of thousands of bombs every year. I believe  from my own personal knowledge of this issue  that there are ways to solve the problems we face. I believe that there are alternative fuel cycles that can be managed safely on global basis. I hope  therefore  that the Conference on the international Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation will have the support and encouragement of every nation.24.	I have heard it said that efforts to control nuclear proliferation are facile  that thing is already out of the bottle. I do not believe this to be true. It should not be forgotten that for 25 years the nuclear club did not expand its membership.  By genuine co-operation we can make certain that this terrible club expands no further.25.	I have talked about the special problems of nuclear arms control' and nuclear proliferation at length. Let me turn to the problem of conventional arms control  which affects potentially or directly every nation represented in this great hall. This is not a matter for the future-even the near future-but one for the immediate present. World-wide military expenditures are. now in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year. Last year the nations of the world spent more than 60 times as much equipping each soldier as we spent educating each child. The industrialized nations spend the most money  but the rate of growth in military spending is faster in the developing world. While only a handful of states produce sophisticated weapons  the number of nations which seek to purchase these weapons is increasing rapidly.26.	The conventional arms race both causes and feeds on the threat of larger and more deadly wars. It levies an enormous burden on an already troubled world economy.27.	.For its part  the United States has now begun to reduce its arms exports. Our aim is to reduce both the quantity and the deadliness of the weapons we sell. We have already taken the first few steps  but we cannot go very far alone. Nations whose neighbours are purchasing large quantities of arms feel constrained to do the same. Supplier nations that practise restraint in arms sales sometimes find that they simply lose valuable commercial markets to other suppliers.28.	We hope to work with other supplier nations to cut back on the flow of arms and to reduce the rate at which the most advanced and sophisticated weapon technologies spread around the world. We do not expect this task to be easy or to produce instant results. But we are committed to stop the spiral of the increasing sale of weapons.29.	Equally important  we hope that purchaser nations  individually and through regional organizations  will limit their arms imports. We are ready to provide to some nations the necessary means for legitimate self-defence  but we are also eager to work with any nation or region in order to decrease the need for more numerous  more deadly and ever more expensive weapons.30.	Fourteen years ago  one of my predecessors spoke in this hall under circumstances that in certain ways resembled these. It was a time  he said  of comparative calm and there was art atmosphere of rising hope about the prospect of controlling nuclear energy. The first specific step had been taken to limit the nuclear arms race-a test-ban treaty signed by nearly a hundred nations.31.	But the succeeding years did not live up to the optimistic prospect John F. Kennedy placed before this Assembly because  as a community of nations  we failed to address the deepest sources of potential conflict among us.32.	As we seek to establish the principles of detente among the major nuclear Powers  we believe that these principles must also apply in regional conflicts. The United States is committed to the peaceful settlement of differences. We are committed to the strengthening of the peace-making capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations  such as the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of American States.33.	The United States supports the United Kingdom's efforts to bring about a peaceful  rapid transition to majority rule and independence in Zimbabwe. We joined .other members of the Security Council last week and also the Secretary-General in efforts to bring about independence and democratic rule in Namibia. We are pleased with the level of co-operation we have achieved with the leaders of the nations in the area  as well as with those peoples who are struggling for independence. We urge South Africa and other nations to support the proposed solution to the problems in Zimbabwe  and to co-operate still more closely in providing for a smooth and prompt transition in Namibia.34.	But it is essential that all outside nations exercise restraint in their actions in Zimbabwe and Namibia  so that we can bring about that majority rule and avoid a widening war that could engulf the southern half of the African continent.35.	Of all the regional conflicts in the world  none holds more menace than the Middle East. War there has already carried the world to the edge of nuclear confrontation. It has already disrupted the world economy and imposed severe hardships on the people in the developed and the developing nations alike. So true peace-peace embodied in binding treaties—is essential. It will be in the interest of the Israelis and the Arabs. It is in the interest of the American people. It is in the interest of the entire world.36.	The United Nations Security Council has provided the basis for peace in resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  but negotiations in good faith by all parties is needed to give substance to peace.37.	Such negotiations in good faith must be inspired by a recognition that all nations in the area-Israel and the Arab countries-have a right to exist in peace  with the early establishment of economic and cultural exchanges and of normal diplomatic relations. Peace must include a process in which the bitter divisions o: generations  even centuries- hatreds and suspicions—can be overcome. Negotiations cannot be successful if any of the parties harbours the deceitful view that peace is simply an interlude in which to prepare for war.38.	Negotiations in good faith will also require acceptance by all sides of the fundamental rights and interest of everyone involved.39.	For Israel  this means borders that are recognized and secure. Security arrangements are crucial to a nation that has fought for its survival in each of the last four decades. The commitment of the United States to Israel's security is unquestionable.40.	For the Arabs  the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized. One of the things that binds the American people to Israel is our shared respect for human rights and the courage with which Israel has defended such rights. It is clear that a true and lasting peace in the Middle East must also respect the rights of all the peoples of the area. How these rights are to be defined and implemented is  of course; for the interested parties to decide in detailed negotiations  and not for us to dictate.41.	We do not intend to impose from the outside a settlement on the nations of the Middle East.42.	The United States has been meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Israel and the Arab nations involved in the search for peace. We are staying in close contact with the Soviet Union  with which we share responsibility for reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. As a result of these consultations  the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed to call for the resumption of the Geneva Conference before the end of this year. While a number of procedural questions remain  if the parties continue to act in good faith  I believe that these questions can be answered.31043.	The major Powers have a special responsibility to act with restraint in areas of the world where they have competing interests because the association of these interests with local rivalries and conflicts can lead to serious confrontation. In the Indian Ocean area neither we nor the Soviet Union has a large military presence  nor is there a rapidly mounting competition between us. Restraint in the area may well begin with a mutual effort to stabilize our presence and to avoid an escalation in military competition. Then both sides can consider how our military activities in the Indian Ocean area might be even further-reduced.44.	The peaceful settlement of differences is  of course  essential. The United States is willing to abide by that principle  as in the case of the recently signed Panama Canal treaties. Once ratified  these treaties can transform the United States-Panama relationship into one that permanently protects the interests and respects the sovereignty of both our countries.45.	We have all survived and surmounted major challenges since the United Nations was founded  but we can accelerate progress even in a world of ever-increasing diversity. A commitment to strengthen international institutions is vital  but progress lies also in our own national policies. We can work together to form a community of peace if we accept the kind of obligations that I have suggested today.46.	To summarize: first  there is an obligation to remove the threat of nuclear weaponry  to reverse the build-up of armaments and the trade in them  and to conclude bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements that can bring security to all of us.47.	In order to reduce the reliance of nations on nuclear weaponry  1 hereby solemnly declare  on behalf of the United States  that we will not use nuclear weapons except in self-defence; that is  in circumstances of an actual nuclear or conventional attack on the United States  our territories or armed forces  or such an attack on our allies.48.	In addition  we hope that initiatives by the Western nations to secure mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe will be met by equal response from the Warsaw Pact countries.49.	Secondly  an obligation to show restraint in areas of tension  to negotiate disputes and settle them peacefully  and to strengthen the peace-making capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations.50.	And  finally  an effort by all nations  East as well as West  North as well as South  to fulfil mankind's aspirations for human development and human freedom. It is to meet these basic demands that we build Governments and seek peace.51.	We must share these obligations for our own mutual survival and our own mutual prosperity.52.	We can see a world at peace. We can work for a world without want. We can build a global community dedicated to these purposes and to human dignity.53.	The view that I have sketched for you today is that of only one leader in only one nation. However wealthy and powerful the United States may be  however capable of leadership  this power is increasingly only relative. The leadership increasingly is in need of being shared. No nation has a monopoly of vision  of creativity or of ideas. Bringing these together from many nations is our common responsibility and our common challenge. For only in these ways can the idea of a peaceful global community grow and prosper. 	"
"135",7345,"VEN",32,1977,"﻿97.	 Mr. President  it is particularly pleasant for me  on behalf of the delegation of Venezuela  to extend to you our most cordial congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. As the first Ambassador of Venezuela to Yugoslavia  1 know well and have the utmost admiration for the role your country has played in world politics. Hence  my words go beyond mere formality when I state that we are convinced that under your stewardship and guidance the tasks and negotiations of this General Assembly will be particularly fruitful  not only for the vast group of countries10 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.we belong to  but for all Member States of the United Nations; in fact  for all the peoples of the world who have placed their faith in it.98.	At the same time  I should like to express  on behalf of my delegation  our appreciation to Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe for his dedication and commitment to the international cause. Having been the Permanent Representative of Venezuela to the United Nations for the last three years  I should also like to extend our greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose loyalty to the exacting and complex duties of his high post has earned our respect.99.	I should like to welcome most cordially the countries which have now joined our Organization: the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti  the former an ancient people  the latter a new country. Viet Nam gave us lessons of heroism and reaffirmed what history had already taught us: that no force in the world  however mighty  can vanquish those who live or die for the independence and sovereignty of their country. Venezuela had the privilege of participating in the United Nations Mission which observed the process of independence of Djibouti  at the time of the referendum. We are pleased to express our solidarity to that country.100.	This General Assembly is gathering at a moment of expectations and shadows. To the old conflicts for which the Organization has been trying to find balanced formulas for solutions and settlements  others have been added which are no less serious and grave  presenting a picture of risks and dangers  to which the Secretary-General referred clearly  although soberly  when he pointed out that  without doubt  1977 had been a year of growing anxiety for the international community.101.	In the face of political tensions  whether ancient or not  the economic and social problems of the third world become more serious from day to day. Yet  we come to this session of the General Assembly convinced that dialogue and tenacity in negotiations are the only means to attain the solutions we seek.102.	This Session of the General Assembly will have among the most important items on its agenda the continuation of the North-South dialogue. The United Nations is the most appropriate framework for these negotiations since the problems raised are of direct concern to all our peoples. The results of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation have already been reviewed here and will continue to be the subject of our debates. We are certain that the negotiators in Paris did not spend their time in vain. Today  the conviction is gaining ground that the challenge mankind faces must be met in accordance with the terms and objectives stated by the third world.103.	We  the developing countries  may have a variety of interests  but we do have essentially common objectives. In this fundamental unity lies the negotiating power of the third world; co-operative actions among developing countries strengthen and consolidate it. Such militant solidarity among the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America— which in turn is an important element in enabling us to face the North-South dialogue with greater chances of success- permits our commitment to the principle of collective self-reliance to assume an ever-increasing importance. The efforts of each and every one supplement the efforts of the whole to attain our common objectives.104.	Despite the gravity of our problems  we have not adopted intransigent positions nor have we. made impossible claims. As the Venezuelan Minister  Mr. Manuel Perez Guerrero said here only a few days ago:  For our part  we are equally determined to pursue international co-operation and to defend our interests.105.	At the Paris stage of the North-South dialogue  the results obtained were limited in scope  as some far-reaching problems such as the protection of the purchasing power of the export earnings of developing countries and the problem of growing indebtedness  were practically overlooked. The former is basic; the latter is urgent. Our countries cannot forgo the goals of the new international economic order  and we are certain that no one seriously doubts that this is the only course and the only choice open both to the developing countries which demand it and to those societies whose progress and affluence were nourished on injustice and contempt for the rights of others.106.	There is a definite contrast between the economic and social restrictions imposed on our countries and the uncontrollable  suicidal explosion of military expenditure and the arms race. Upon my appointment by the Secretary-General  I had the honour to participate in the group of consultant experts which brought up to date the report entitled Economic and Social Consequences of the Arms Race and Military Expenditures. The report rightly points out that it is necessary to disclose openly the dangers inherent in a continued arms race  and to dispel the illusion that peace and security can coexist with immense stockpiles of the means of destruction.107.	This is an objective report. Its conclusions are alarming beyond doubt. The arms race and military expenditures increase or remain at disquieting levels. Over $350 billion are invested every year in the manufacture of and trade in weapons. Scientists by the thousands are devoting their creative talents as well as the prodigious and boundless resources of science to the sole  exclusive purpose of making better weapons  increasing their destructive capability and laying the groundwork for the annihilation of mankind to happen in the shortest possible time. It is no longer enough to stockpile hundreds of thousands of kilos of plutonium in the arsenals of the super-Powers. On the one hand  nuclear physicists intensify the destructive power of weapons; while  on the other hand  certain schools of strategists and political scientists are busy designing the setting for presumed nuclear wars which they call  limited . Would it not be actually absurd to speculate on the possibility of one nuclear Power's agreeing with another on an exercise of limited destruction. And  in any case  if they did agree on this  it is doubtful that it would be within their own borders.108.	The Secretary-General points out in his annual report on the work of the Organization that every day $900 million are spent for military purposes and he goes on to say: In a world where scientific and technological capability is one of the keys to the future  25 per cent of the world's scientific manpower and 40 per cent of all research and development spending is engaged for military purposes.Let us reflect on these awesome facts described by the Secretary-General in his report.109.	As a consequence of this crisis—which reveals very grave symptoms among mankind and in the present-day world-nuclear proliferation has become a definite threat. Without a doubt  it is a threat which can and does arouse the utmost anxiety because it brings into the open the fact that power is contagious for many countries  as is the idea of the false prestige of belonging to the nuclear club.110.	Venezuela will continue to support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace so as to give effect to the aspirations of the countries of certain regions of the world and because it is one of the most reliable means to strengthen international peace and security.111.	It was especially significant for Latin America that the United States signed the Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). We trust that this will serve as an example for those Powers which have not yet adhered to Additional Protocols I and II of the Tlatelolco Treaty  with a view to enhancing the image of our continent as the first denuclearized zone in the world.112.	The problems of the arms race cannot be detached from the economic and social problems which are the basis of the North-South dialogue. This is also a moral issue to which we cannot be indifferent. Military expenditures and their soaring costs affect and prevent rational agreements in the domain of just solutions. The army of scientists whose talents are used entirely in the service of destruction should have a destiny in accord with the human condition. Hunger and the world food crisis can be adequately surmounted only by means of science and technology. The energy problem  which is rendered more acute by voracious consumption of traditional resources  such as gas and oil  could now have had different options had not research on alternate sources  like solar energy  been held back by the large transnational corporations which for more than a century maintained a monopoly over the traditional sources. As a result of this lack of foresight  all of mankind now faces an uncertain future.113.	It is only the political decision of states which can halt the uncontrolled race towards world destruction and  especially  the will of the great Powers which  because they possess nuclear weapons  profess to manage the political balance of the world.114.	Because of the awareness of this danger  and in the hope of achieving tangible results  it was decided to convene a special session of the General Assembly in 1978 devoted to disarmament the success of which will depend on the unanimous effort and the active participation of all States Members of the United Nations.115.	Since the beginning of the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas in 1974  the position of Venezuela regarding the exploitation of the sea-bed has been clear and firm in defence of the basic principles which the countries of the third world have upheld.116.	We must emphasize two fundamental aspects of this problem which we deem to be of paramount importance in establishing the new international economic order for future generations. In the first place  the regime for exploitation to be adopted  which will regulate the use and benefits of an area corresponding to two thirds of our planet; and  secondly  the institution of a resource policy which would provide the mineral-producing developing countries with effective protection from any adverse economic effects that might follow from an unrestrained exploitation of the sea-bed.117.	In the Conference on the Law of the Sea we have always supported the establishment of a unitary system for exploiting the resources in the international area of the sea-bed. Our position is based on our acceptance without reservation of the principles of the indivisibility of the area and of the discretionary power of the Authority over its activities  which could be regulated.118.	Establishing a strong Authority will guarantee that the exploitation of the resources of the area will be for the benefit of the international community.119.	The indivisibility of the area is a concept which is not subject to negotiation since this represents the effective application of the principle of the common heritage of mankind  the validity of which has been recognized by all countries represented here. The indivisibility of the area in turn conditions the existence of an Authority with broad discretionary powers which  within the framework of the Convention  will enable it to decide on the manner of exploitation and the use and distribution of the resources thus obtained.120.	Nevertheless  in the spirit of co-operation which has always guided us  we are prepared to take a position which will clear the way for an agreement for the benefit of all mankind.121.	To this end we have proposed at the Conference on the Law of the Sea that a compromise be adopted between the unitary system of exploitation and what has been called the parallel system  on the understanding that the system to be adopted by way of negotiation be of a temporary character and that all the areas granted under this system automatically revert to the Authority at the end of the period stipulated in the Convention.122.	The second aspect which disturbs us in connection with the problem of exploiting the sea-bed is that of the countries dependent on the export of minerals. They should not be harmed by this new economic activity.123.	An irrational and unrestrained exploitation of those immense resources by a restricted number of transnational corporations represents an obvious danger to the export earnings and  therefore  to the development plans  of a considerable number of developing countries. At the Conference of the Law of the Sea a formula has been proposed whereby production in the sea-bed would be regulated so as to be complementary to land-based production. It is not that the third world is opposed to the exploitation of the resources of the sea as the spokesmen of certain industrialized countries repeatedly maintain. The fundamental issue is that the sea-bed should be exploited in an orderly way  without damage to countries whose economies depend to a large degree on minerals or raw materials from the sea-bed  avoiding at all costs the establishment of a monopoly for the exploitation of resources which  ultimately  are the common heritage of mankind  for present and future generations.124.	Human rights constitute one of the subjects to which our Organization devotes time; much effort and perseverance have been concentrated on them.125.	Human rights being one of the basic pillars of our international policy  as we reiterated in the joint declaration of the President of Venezuela and the President of the United States  we should like to state now our intention of supporting those initiatives in the field of human rights which tend to strengthen and promote strict surveillance of and compliance with human rights  wherever attempts are made to violate or disregard them. This is why we have sponsored initiatives in this field through our regional forum  by ratifying the American Convention on Human Rights  designed to promote the dignity of the individual throughout the hemisphere.126.	The human rights issue is gaining momentum  and the participation of the international community in preserving them has become more urgent and indispensable. We believe that human rights extend into the universal ambit. The United Nations Charter is  in this respect  a clear commitment.127.	One of the contemporary features which most affect essential human rights is the expression of violence in the world  in different ways  such as the kidnapping of persons and hijacking of means of transport  the seizure of hostages and the assault and killing of innocent human beings. These acts are a clear violation of the individual security and the integrity of human beings  as well as of peace among nations.128.	In this very forum we have warned that  rather than devote ourselves to an exhaustive task of interpreting violence  what is required is to take action. Venezuela has also indicated its criteria in regard to activities to which the term  terrorism  should not be applied. They are those that are part of the liberation struggles now being waged. ... violence which takes the form of criminal action can never be a political act. No cause whatsoever  however noble or justified  can mingle with deeds associating or identifying it with manifestations of delinquency or lese humanite.129.	Venezuela will continue to participate actively in all efforts made here to bring about the prompt drafting and adoption of a set of rules to make the will of the international community effective in eliminating the scourge of violence and  as stated by the President of Venezuela in this same forum last year  to fulfil the wish for a coherent international response capable or Facing the scourge in rational terms.130.	When mention is made of the human rights question  we must all  as a matter of course  think of Africa and  in particular  of the peoples subjected to the apartheid regime. There have been few doctrines in history  without excepting nazism  as -shameful as the one practised by the regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia  which the former extends to and imposes on the Territory of Namibia. This year Venezuela attended the Maputo International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and the Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid. In the Security Council we have supported and will always resolutely support the sanctions upon the illegal Rhodesian regime that are necessary to clear the way for majority rule  and we shall contribute as necessary to ensure that Namibia obtains its independence  in accordance with United Nations decisions. Acting on our deeply-rooted conviction  Venezuela will continue to. condemn the policy of the Pretoria regime. It is this Pretoria regime  which has relied on such ample and exceptional technological co-operation that is now preparing to carry out nuclear tests and explosions and is undoubtedly the central point of the crisis which threatens all of southern Africa.131.	The immense economic investments of the transnational corporations in that region  which are the subject of an impressive report by the United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations  '' have without any doubt generated the danger to world peace represented today by the conflict in southern Africa.132.	As a Latin American and as a Venezuelan  I should like to refer with satisfaction to the recent achievements of the five countries which are members of the Andean Pact: Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela. With the agreement on automotive programming signed in the capital of Ecuador  our countries have taken an extraordinarily significant step towards integration  opening the way to a firm and powerful economic future  capable of generating the balanced development of our peoples and their economies.133.	The process of economic integration is a political fact which is taking place in Latin America as the only valid option for our peoples. We are convinced that Latin American unity is indispensable  and that is why we are determined to strengthen it. To be sure  the political decision was not a simple matter  as it was not easy to implement Decision 24 of the Cartagena Agreement which drew up rules for foreign capital in the subregion. The agreement on automotive programming was reached after a number of difficulties. These were encouraged from outside  as will be logically understood: the pervasive influence of transnational corporations conspiring against any economic effort which does not comply with their conditions. This proves  once again  how urgent it is to have a code of conduct to regulate the activities of those corporations.134.	We Venezuelans will make every possible effort to strengthen the Andean Pact and to tighten the links binding our peoples together. This is one of the basic ideas of our international policy. The new economic order will of necessity be tied to experiments such as this  or will build on them.135.	In other words  we  the countries of the third world  must open up our own ways  and among the possible ones  integration will give us strength in addition to other advantages  because there is strength in being united  and five together carry more weight than five separately  as in the case of the Andean group.136.	Lastly  on behalf of the President of Venezuela and of our people  I must refer to the new treaties on the Panama Canal signed on 7 September by the Latin American Republic of Panama and the United States of America. During the entire twentieth century the Canal has been a source of differences between our countries and the powerful nation that kept a colonial enclave there  dividing the small isthmus country in two. The new treaties returning to the Republic of Panama its sovereignty over the entire territory of the nation were signed in Washington in the presence and with the support of the peoples of Latin America. President Carlos Andres Perez  in his first message to Venezuelans in March 1974  stated that the problem of the Panama Canal was not only a problem for Panama nor exclusively a Latin American problem  but a problem for all free peoples in the world. And here  before the General Assembly in 1976  he reiterated similar views. Before the Organization of American States  during his visit to the United States the President of Venezuela said: Our relations with the United States cannot be good relations unless this problem is satisfactorily solved with full recognition of Panamanian sovereignty .This long-standing Latin American claim has now been satisfied in the new Treaties. Panama has recovered its sovereignty. There are no Latin Americans nor Latin American countries which did not feel that the Panamanian cause was theirs.137.	Now the treaties and the fate of relations between the United States and Latin America  as well as harmony and understanding in this part of the world  are in the hands of the Congress of the United States  whose ratification will make the treaties legally valid. We have no doubt that the18 Agreement on Andean Subregional Integration  signed at Bogota on 26 May 1969.United States Congress  the source of legal power in this great nation  will ratify these treaties. The nearly 150 countries that constitute the world community will be waiting for the major decision to be taken in Washington.138.	The deceptive campaign mounted by those who represent the past and those who represent obscure and powerful economic interests to the effect that there is no Panama Canal but a  United States canal in Panama  not only constitutes an attempt to mislead a great people  such as that of the United States  but is also an attempt to offend the entire world community meeting here under the auspices of this General Assembly. Despite this neo-colonial campaign  we Venezuelans are confident that the United States Congress will understand the rights of a small and noble people and will exercise the intelligence and understanding that President Carter exercised when he signed the Treaties.139.	I conclude by reiterating that the delegation of Venezuela is certain that our debates will be fruitful and that the spirit of co-operation will guide our negotiations. Ever since the founding of the United Nations  my country has been a faithful believer in its principles and has loyally complied with our commitments. Today more than ever  we place our faith in the role of this world Organization. "
"136",7455,"WSM",32,1977,"﻿1.	First I must extend to you  Sir  the warm wishes and congratulations of Samoa  my delegation and myself on your Installation as President of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. You will bring to this Assembly the wisdom and experience that Yugoslavia has developed over the years in the fields of international relations and diplomacy.2.	Yugoslavia has long been a leader in the search for world peace and in the evolution of the non-aligned movement through which the bulk of the developing countries can make themselves heard as a force both for peace and for the betterment of life for the majority of the peoples of the world.3.	Samoa doubly congratulates you on the honour that this world body has bestowed upon you and  through you. upon Yugoslavia.4.	Samoa has close links with Yugoslavia  and only recently we were honoured by the visit to Samoa of the Vice-President of the Council of Deputies of Yugoslavia. Samoan leaders will likewise visit Yugoslavia next year  and both our countries are in detailed negotiations on economic co-operation matters. Samoa welcomes your presidency of this Assembly.5.	I also express my country's gratitude to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  both for his inspired leadership of the United Nations and for his personal assistance to us during Samoa's first year of membership. I value this very much  and we are most grateful for his assistance and the assistance of the various staff members of the UnitedNations who have helped us during this year and in the establishment of our Permanent Mission in New York.6.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express to the Government and people of Viet Nam the congratulations of Samoa on the achievement by Viet Nam of membership status in the United Nations. Likewise  we also congratulate the new State of Djibouti on its accession to membership in the United Nations.7.	Samoa was the first nation of Polynesia to achieve independence and the first Polynesian State to become a Member of the United Nations. Polynesia stretches from the islands of Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south  from Samoa and Tongo in the west to French Polynesia and Easter Island in the east. The Polynesians are a homogeneous group with close cultural and linguistic affinities. The word ""love"" in the Maori language is ""Aroha""  in the Samoan language is ""Alofa""  and in the Hawaiian language is ""Aloha"".8.	The major issue confronting the world today is the search by man for a harmonious relationship with his fellow man and with his environment. The Polynesians by necessity achieved a relationship with the environment over a thousand years ago. The quarters of the moon tell us about the tides and the seasons of fish. The flowers bloom and they also have a message. The Polynesians are a seafaring people and produced mariners who navigated by the stars over countless thousands of miles. They struck a balance with nature. They were one with the environment.9.	it is this same oneness with the environment that we are seeking today. We are all seeking a balance between man and nature. It would be unrealistic to retreat to earlier eras: there are new pressures on the world that make retreat impossible. World populations have grown; there are increased pressures on natural resources; there are new demands for a higher quality of life. These pressures and demands cannot be ignored. We must find a new ecological balance with the environment. In a positive sense  it is what the law of the sea is about. In a negative sense  it is what nuclear-weapons testing is about.10.	We need to approach these problems with the correct perspective. But what is the correct perspective? The English language recognizes two perspectives: the ""bird's- eye view"" and the ""worm's-eye view"". The Polynesians recognize three perspectives: that of a man on top of the mountain  that of a man on top of a tree and that of a man in a canoe. Who is to say which man has the right perspective? The man on top of the mountain certainly has the best panoramic view and can see the whole picture. But the man in the canoe is better placed to see the school of fish. 11.	All have a role to play. The art lies in allowing each to make his contribution  in the pooling of complementary resources. The man on top of the mountain makes his contribution  the man on top of the tree his  and the man in the canoe his. But neither can ignore the other. Likewise  each Member country  no matter how large or small  must be able to contribute to the common good. That is why Samoa feels that a small nation  like the man in the canoe  can make an essential contribution to the United Nations. The United Nations needs the three perspectives  or as many perspectives as are available to it.12.	An important factor in the formulation of Samoa's perceptions is the colonial experience  which has exacted a high price from our people. Samoa was partitioned in the late nineteenth century by decree in Europe. We are still separated from our fellow Samoans. We have experienced the demeaning nature of colonialism. We have always struggled against our colonial masters. Lives have been lost. Samoans have been exiled simply because they held dear the principles of the dignity of man. Our struggles were spread over 100 years and coincided with the great freedom movements in Asia and Africa. Samoa was an integral part of the independence struggle. We know what it is all about.13.	Samoa achieved independence in 1962. Samoa welcomes the fact that in our region three countries—the Solomon Islands  the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu-will achieve independence in the very near future. But problems remain  and elements of colonialism linger in the South Pacific and elsewhere.14.	Samoa is watching with interest the political developments that are occurring in the New Hebrides. Our sympathies are with the people of the New Hebrides in their struggle for freedom  and we look forward to the day—which  we hope  will be in the near future-when that country achieves full and independent nationhood.15.	Samoa is sad  however  that the political process towards independence in other parts of the South Pacific is not moving at the same pace. We hope that the people of these remaining Territories will grasp the opportunities that present themselves to reassess their political future and will choose paths that will lead towards the full realization of the destinies of their various countries.16.	Samoa did not achieve independence because it was fashionable  nor does Samoa now oppose colonialism because it is likewise fashionable. On the contrary  Samoa achieved independence because the Samoan people fought for it. We continue to oppose colonialism because we cannot accept the dominance of one group of people over another. We cannot compromise on this basic issue. The rule of a minority against the wishes of a majority cannot be tolerated. We deplore racism and repression in whatever form they might take. We regard apartheid to be abhorrent. Our sympathy and support for the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe is based on these clear principles. So when Samoa talks about colonialism and repression  whether in Africa  in the South Pacific  in Asia or elsewhere  it is not just rhetoric. Rather  Samoa's opposition to colonialism is fundamental because of its own experience.17.	By the same token. Samoa is not engaging in rhetoric when it expresses its opposition to nuclear testing. We in the South Pacific are experiencing  against our wishes  the continued testing of nuclear weapons. We are firmly opposed to nuclear-weapons testing in all environments  anywhere in the world. The concept behind the acquisition  testing and proliferation of nuclear weapons is wrong and cannot be justified if we all have as our basic objective the attainment of world peace.18.	The whole idea of the United Nations Charter is to gather the nations together to seek a consensus  to solve by discussion rather than by conflict. We are all part of the human family. Issues are discussed here which affect us all. We should all have a voice. Not only the super-Powers  which have enough in their arsenals to destroy themselves and the whole world  but the other nations  should be allowed to put forward their perspectives  unshackled by old and discredited formulas.19.	Samoa is a non-committed nation. It has no defence treaties with anyone. Samoa has a close affinity with the non-aligned movement. We are of the third world. The problems and aspirations of the third world are our problems and aspirations. We will approach from that basic point of view the problems that come before the United Nations.20.	We will determine our position on the various issues that come before the United Nations on the basis of our own assessment. Our approach to the important political issues such as Africa  the Middle East question and the Korean question will be constructive. We will not intervene for the sake of scoring debating points  but when we do speak it will be to state a point of view that might contribute in a small way to a solution. We are encouraged that  as time progresses  attitudes change  new priorities are established  the meaning of words differs  an evolutionary process develops—all of which tends to make it easier for a consensus or an accommodation to be reached on contentious issues. We are mindful also that usually in such issues it is the major players who must reach an accommodation. This might be by quiet diplomacy in this building or elsewhere. It might also be by bilateral talks. We support this concept and shall respect such activities whenever we are speaking.21.	Our concern will be that one party does not dominate to the detriment of the other. The rights of all must be protected. The right to exist  the right to prosper and the right to have one's point of view respected are valuable rights to which Samoa strongly subscribes. Dominance by one country or one group is evil and contains within it the danger of a reaction from other groups. Similarly  great- Power rivalry and great-Power dominance  often for the sake of dominance rather than for any other reason  is to be deplored. The South Pacific has in the recent past been free from such rivalries—but the indications are that this is changing. Samoa is firmly opposed to attempts from any direction to create such rivalry. Samoa views this as senseless activity which serves no good purpose and which might even aggravate world tensions. Samoa will do all in its power to prevent this from happening.22.	Samoa has no quarrel with any nation. We have old friends and we are gaining new friends. We have a basic policy of universalism and we pledge to work closely with all countries that extend to us the hand of genuine friendship.23.	My address would not be complete without a brief reference to two economic matters  the new international economic order and the law of the sea. I do not have to remind you that the major economic problem facing the world today is the wide gap between the standard of living of the advanced industrial countries and that of the developing countries. It is also the major political problem  because the disparity between developed and developing transcends political ideologies.24.	As a third-world country  Samoa joins in the urgent demand of the developing countries for a new international economic order. The demand is for fundamental changes in the structures of economic dominance and inequality. We believe it must proceed and apply universally and not sectorally. The changes must be structural rather than marginal. Above all  they are changes that must relate to human needs and the human condition. We believe that any new international economic order must be founded on moral and social justice no less than on economic and political realities. There is too much at stake for it to be otherwise.25.	Likewise  we regard particular aspects of the law of the sea as forming an integral part of the new international economic order. These provide a means of ensuring a sharing of a major resource among the people of the world on a just and equitable basis.26.	For all nations of the South Pacific  the law of the sea has special meaning. The sea does more than provide sustenance to us. It has shaped and influenced our respective characters and our livelihoods for centuries. For some South Pacific nations  the sea and all it contains is their only exploitable resource. Samoa regards it as essential that a satisfactory conclusion be reached on the law of the sea. We urge that the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea act positively in the creation of a new law of the sea which will be both sensible and fair.27.	The South Pacific nations are willing to share this resource with the other nations of the world. It is important for all nations  developed and developing  that a comprehensive and workable law of the sea regime  which includes an effective system for the settlement of disputes  be achieved. If not  the South Pacific nations should not be blamed if they group together to protect their major resource from outside encroachments.28.	Finally  I thank the Assembly for its attention. This is the first time that Samoa has taken a full role in the general debate of the United Nations. This for Samoa is a historic occasion. For me it has added poignancy. Samoa's delegation  which included the present Head of State and my father  travelled to the United Nations in 1958 to put Samoa's case for independence to the world body. It was the United Nations that accepted what they had to say-and it was the United Nations that agreed to Samoa's independence. Now it is the United Nations that has welcomed back the new generation of Samoa as a full Member. 			"
"137",7493,"YEM",32,1977,"﻿119.	 Mr. President  it gives me pleasure  on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic  to congratulate you on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its thirty-second session. We hold high hopes that you will meet with success in steering these deliberations towards the positive results to which we aspire and which we hope will constitute a step taken by the peoples of the world on the road towards a world where security and prosperity will prevail.120.	While congratulating you on your assumption of this lofty post  may I also congratulate  through you  the Government and people of friendly Yugoslavia  a country to which we are bound by cordial and firm ties in the framework of the principles of the non-aligned movement  the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the norms which govern the family of nations to which we belong.121.	Your election to this high office is but an expression of our need to benefit from your personal ability and experience as you guide the proceedings of this important session  as well as a mark of the appreciation of the Members of this Organization for the role played by your country and your great leader  President Josip Broz Tito  in consolidating international security and understanding through your pioneer action in the non-aligned movement.122.	Your predecessor  our dear friend  Mr. Amerasinghe  the head of the Sri Lanka delegation and the President of the thirty-first session  left a remarkable impression as he presided over its deliberations. For this he deserve.  praise and appreciation.123.	I also express my Government's appreciation for the fruitful efforts deployed by the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  in order to find a just and lasting solution for the problems of Palestine and the Middle East and of the domination of the white minority in Africa. The efforts exerted by the Secretary-General  his dedication and his devotion to achieving peace and security in our troubled world will undoubtedly contribute to promoting the work of this Organization and increasing its effectiveness. The important role assumed by the Secretary-General merits co-operation from all Member States so that peace and stability may prevail all over the world.124.	It has become an obvious fact in our day and age that co-operation has become a necessity for solving increasingly complex and interrelated problems. The technological revolution and the population explosion witnessed by contemporary generations have created great problems which transcend geographical as well as political boundaries and impose collective action for their solution. These variables in turn reaffirm the importance of the role played by this Organization as an effective instrument for directing the efforts of the international community towards appropriate solutions to the sum of problems  in all their aspects. The need for such a collective instrument increases day by day in a world parts of which are afflicted by conditions which contravene the principles of international law and the ethics of contemporary man. The United Nations is called upon today more than ever before to assume its responsibility for tackling the problems ensuing from aggression and usurpation  to put an immediate  end once and for all to the occupation of land belonging to others and to racial oppression and to halt the exploitation of poor States by rich States. These conditions constitute a challenge to our collective will and at the same time represent a derogation of the principles and goals of this Organization. In practice we have to reaffirm our compliance with the principles of justice  equality and self- determination in our bilateral and multilateral relations.125.	The Yemen Arab Republic is fully convinced that the best method of dealing with contemporary international relations is by means of collective co-operation within the framework of this Organization and  given such a premise  we are extremely happy to witness the admission of two new Members to this Organization—the fraternal Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. These admissions confer greater universality on this Organization and secure the participation of almost all the peoples of the world in forging our common destiny.126.	As we welcome the admission of the Republic of Djibouti to membership in this Organization  we are confident that that young Republic  through its strategic location and the vitality of its people  will play a constructive role in achieving understanding and cooperation between the countries of the region.127.	The Yemen Arab Republic has associated itself  at an early stage  with those who have called for the avoidance of any obstacles which impede the exercise of the right of every country to membership in this Organization. We called upon the permanent members of the Security Council not to abuse their right of veto so as to prevent the exercise of such a right.128.	The responsibility entrusted to the Organization is weighty and mankind is looking for peace to prevail all over She world. If the powerful States do not contribute to the implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council arid of the General Assembly they will thereby fail the Organization and thwart the aspirations of mankind and its desire to achieve peace  security and prosperity.129.	There are many issues under consideration by the General Assembly  issues which have been discussed at length in the past and on which numerous resolutions have been adopted. Had those resolutions been implemented  such issues would not figure on the agenda now  nor would they cause and give rise to complications and aggravation. There is no doubt that the lack of solutions to such vital questions constitutes a great threat to peace and stability in many parts of the world. The fact that certain Members of the Organization disregard some United Nations resolutions and that those resolutions remain unimplemented harms the effectiveness of this Organization  causes great anxiety and shows up the responsibility of all Member States and especially the great Powers  which are permanent members of the Security Council.130.	Among the most important issues which concern the international community is the question of Palestine  which is still under consideration by the General Assembly after 30 years. The core of this problem is the usurpation by Israel of Palestine and its continued denial of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people  its insistence on following an aggressive  expansionist and racist policy  and its repressive practices vis-à-vis the Palestinian people. This situation constitutes a challenge to the international community at large and clearly flouts the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.131.	We maintain that the realization of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East region cannot take place unless there is a solution to the Palestine problem  which is the crux of the conflict in the area. And prominent among the elements of a settlement is the recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people  including that of self-determination and the full exercise of their national rights  together with the establishment of their independent State on the soil of Palestine.132.	In spite of the efforts made to solve the Palestine and Middle East questions with a view to achieving peace and security  the intransigence and stubbornness of Israel  its disregard of United Nations resolutions and its persistence in challenging the will of the international community are an obstacle to attainment of a just and lasting peace. Furthermore  Israel's constant efforts to distort the facts  to dilute the substance of the question and to preoccupy the international community with procedural and formalists questions undermine all the efforts made in this respect. Israel has utilized the procedure of holding the Geneva Conference as a dilatory tactic to water down the basic issues  and continues to seek to distort and deceive world public opinion  belittling the efforts of the superpowers to solve this problem and to hold that Conference.133.	Israel continues undeterred in its policy of expansion  annexation  mass expulsion and repressive actions taken agar innocent inhabitants  and of setting up settlements in occupied lands  especially on the West Bank. Israel continues to take measures and to issue decrees aimed at changing the religious character of the City of Jerusalem and the political  demographic and cultural situation in the occupied Arab territories. Proof of this is the latest Tel Aviv decree whereby Israeli laws and regulations are applied in the occupied Arab territories.134.	The new Israeli leadership continues its arrogance and recalcitrance in full view of the whole world  and continues to establish new settlements and to deny the rights of the Palestinian people. The international community is convinced that no just and lasting peace in the region can be established without a comprehensive settlement based upon the subsequent Israeli withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab territories  including the city of Jerusalem  the recognition of the full rights of the Palestinian people and the establishment of a Palestinian State on the soil of Palestine. In order to ensure the success of any efforts aimed at settling the Palestine and Middle East questions  the Palestinian people—as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization-must take part in the deliberations of any such conference  because the Palestine issue is the crux of the problem and the core of the conflict. Israel has excelled in devising new methods of deceit  treachery  mass murder and political extortion  to an even greater extent than all of the repressive Fascist and racist regimes recorded by history.135.	On the African continent  peoples are still suffering in the same way as the Palestinian people: from the usurpation of their rights and the most atrocious sort of human repression. The peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and Azania continue to struggle under the yoke of the white minority. Hence  the United Nations must put an end to injustice and the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination by co-ordinating its efforts with those of the OAU. The African majority must be enabled to exercise its right to self-determination on its own land  according to its own will and aspirations.136.	The Yemen Arab Republic would like to reaffirm the importance it attaches to the Korean question and to the reunification of the Korean people by peaceful means  as well as to the fostering of propitious circumstances for a continued dialogue between the Korean parties with a view to satisfying the aspirations of the Korean people.137.	As for the situation in Cyprus  we wish to affirm that the United Nations must take effective steps to guarantee the implementation of its resolutions on Cyprus. We believe that continued serious negotiations between the representatives of the two communities  in an atmosphere of freedom and full equality  will eventually lead to a satisfactory agreement acceptable to both sides and thereby protect the interest of both communities in the practice of their respective faiths and in the conduct of their personal affairs  in such as a way as to consolidate the stability  independence and territorial integrity of the island.138.	The Yemen Arab Republic  like all peace-loving Arab States  views with great concern the terrifying arms race and the production of lethal weapons which threaten human civilization and mankind itself with extinction. We that the special session on disarmament scheduled for the middle of next year will lead to an international convention to halt the anus race and to foster disarmament. We should like to reaffirm here our earlier position in support of making the Middle East  Africa and South Asia nuclear-free zones and of declaring the Indian Ocean  the Mediterranean and the Red Sea as peace zones far removed from the conflict and from competition between the great Powers so that the peoples of those regions may devote their efforts and resources to the development of their countries and to the exploitation of their resources  without having to face exploitation  repression or the fear of foreign interference. 139.	Consistent with that position  Yemen Arab Republic views with great concern the events unfolding in the Horn of Africa  that is to say  the foreign interference aimed at dragging that area into a conflict between the Powers.140.	The Yemen Arab Republic has  on many occasions  taken the initiative in offering its good offices in an effort to solve the differences between the countries of the area  and has stressed the need for dialogue among the parties concerned and for adherence to peaceful means in the solution of their differences. From this rostrum we appeal to all interested parties to step up their efforts to solve their problems through dialogue and by peaceful means  in the light of the true facts  equity and fairness. Our country makes every effort to play a positive and effective role in the attempt to put a satisfactory end to the existing situation and to achieve better co-operation among the peoples and countries of the area.141.	The determination of the Yemen Arab Republic to strengthen co-operation among the countries bordering the Red Sea has been demonstrated by our hosting the Quadripartite Summit Conference in Taiz on 22 March  at which President Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiri of Sudan; President Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia; the Chairman of the Presidential Council of Democratic Yemen  Salim Robav'a Ali; and the President of the Supreme Command Council of the Yemen Arab Republic  Colonel Ibrahim Mohamed Al-Hamtli. confirmed in their  Declaration the need to keep the Red Sea as one of peace and co-operation for exploitation of its latent potential by the people of the region.142.	The Yemen Arab Republic believe that the conclusion of a convention regulating the law of the sea is among the paramount issues before us. The sixth session of the Third United Nations Conference oil the Law of the Sea  held in May this year  has made its mark in terms of providing an exchange of views and fostering an understanding of the issues tinder consideration.143.	We wish to reaffirm our position that provisions of any law of the sea should con form to the principle of the equal rights of States and should take Into full account the total sovereignty of the coastal States over straits located within their territorial waters. Ali efforts should be devoted to serving the Interests of all the peoples of the world  without prejudice to the sovereignty of the countries concerned.144.	As a small developing country  we find in this august gathering an excellent forum for the exchange of views and ideas on matters of mutual interest  in the light of our firm conviction that  together with other peoples  large and small  we share the responsibility for creating a more prosperous and secure tomorrow.145.	The new international economic order is but an expression of the sincere and intensive efforts that translate the will of the overwhelming majority of the countries of the world. We are gravely concerned at the obstacles being placed in the path of the implementation of United Nations resolutions and recommendations in that respect. Those resolutions and recommendations are really an expression of basic approach towards building the new international economic order  an approach that may break the grip of backwardness and economic crises and create new prospects for justice and equity for all States  with freedom from hegemony and encroachment on the rights and interests of developing countries in respect of their trade  economy  industry  science and technology.146.	The Yemen Arab Republic regards the dialogue between the developing and developed countries that is known as the North-South dialogue as a positive beginning  as something which must continue. We regret  however  that this dialogue has not yet produced an over-all settlement of the main problems impeding the efforts towards the development of the developing countries. Solutions are within reach. What is lacking is the political will and determination on the part of the Governments of developed countries that is necessary to ensure success for this dialogue.147.	The developing countries did mil voluntarily accept conditions of backwardness  rather  these conditions were imposed upon the peoples of those countries  thereby placing them at the tail end of the march towards economic progress and development.148.	The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic is deeply involved in the march towards the prosperity and development of its people.  Every year new gains are being scored in many projects  in co-operation with the United Nations  other international organizations and friendly brother States. These gains have been made possible by the implementation of the three-year development plan  with an annual increase in the gross national product  at 12.6 per cent. That was followed by the drawing up of a draft of first live-year development plan  to be implemented between 1976 and 1980. The aim of that plan is the development of all sectors of the national economy; it is primarily on establishing an infrastructure. A conference to discuss this draft plan will be held next month in our capital.149.	The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic  as it strives to shake of economic backwardness raise the standard of living of its people  is working at the same time to reunite the two parts of Yemen  through constant dialogue and co-ordination with the Government of the southern part of the homeland. We are cognizant of the lack that this continuing division is inconsistent with the historical social and cultural facts and cannot lead to the fulfilment of the aspiration of the Yemeni people in both parts of the country to achieve reunification.150.	Finally  the Yemen Arab Republic  as it deals with the issues on which the attention of the world is focused  is making diligent efforts to rise above its own limited means and thereby to put into effect the exemplary goals of co-operation and understanding. This is reflected in the cordial and sincere ties binding us to the other countries of the Arab peninsula  which foster a climate propitious to redoubling co-operation and understanding between the peoples of the region.151.	The Yemen Arab Republic  under the leadership of its President  Ibrahim Al-Hamdi  seeks to help in the solution of many regional differences through quiet diplomacy and responsible action  in connexion with any friction or provocation that it may face  including even intentional or unintentional violations of its territorial waters  land and air space. We thereby reaffirm our adherence to the United Nations Charter and our keen desire to seek appropriate solutions through dialogue aid bilateral contacts.152.	We hope that the world Organization will remain strong  united and effective in order to be able to discharge its great responsibilities and meet all challenges  thereby ensuring that peace will prevail throughout the world and that tensions and the spectre of war and conflict will disappear from the international scene once and for all. We hope that this thirty-second session of the General Assembly will fulfil the hopes placed in the Organization by the peoples of the world. Hence  we shoulder our responsibility for ensuring that these deliberations produce positive results  in the interests of mankind. "
"138",7540,"YUG",32,1977,"﻿75. Comrade President  it is with particular satisfaction that 1 wish to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. This election has been hailed in Yugoslavia for reasons that it would be superfluous to explain. The election to the presidency of the General Assembly of a representative of socialist and non-aligned Yugoslavia  at a significant moment in the development of international relations  is a mark of appreciation that we highly esteem. However  it is also an obligation to exert a maximum effort to contribute to the realization of the purposes and decisions of the United Nations.76.	At the same time  1 avail myself of this opportunity to pay full credit to the representative of friendly and non-aligned Sri Lanka  Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe who  by his rich experience and fruitful activity  greatly contributed to the successful work of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly.77.	May I welcome stress the extraordinary importance of the admission to membership in the United Nations of the friendly Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose people  by its heroic struggle and enormous sacrifices  has won the admiration of the whole world  and its own freedom and independence  and has proved its readiness to participate on equal terms  and to make its valuable contribution  in the solving of major problems of the present-day world. We are also pleased to welcome the admission of the Republic of Djibouti  whose independence means a contribution to the liquidation of colonialism and the stabilization of relations in Africa.78.	The international community is faced with new challenges that we must look straight in the eye if we are to stimulate positive developments and arrest the dangerous slide toward new conflicts.79.	It is a fact that equitable bilateral  and in some areas also multilateral  co-operation among States has been expanding in many spheres of international life. Accelerated national and social emancipation  the diversity of approaches to the democratic transformation of relations in the world and the spreading of the struggle for universe'  application of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence have had the effect of uniting ever more the forces fighting for the democratization of international relations and of constantly shifting the relation of forces in the world in favour of peace and progress. The peoples of the world are resisting ever more energetically all forms of dependence  aggression  interference in internal affairs  domination and exploitation. The affirmation of one's own approach to social development and of the authentic values of social and national communities are becoming increasingly one of the essential characteristics of our epoch.80.	All this has also been reflected during the recent visits of President Tito to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. These visits have undoubtedly contributed considerably to the promotion of relations and the strengthening of co-operation and friendship between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the three aforementioned friendly countries  on the basis of respect for the well-known principles of independence  sovereignty  equal rights  territorial integrity  non-interference in internal affairs and independent choice of ways of internal social  economic and political development. One of the very important results of the visits has been yet another strong affirmation of these principles  which form the basis of active and peaceful coexistence. Strict respect for these principles by all the States Members of the United Nations is the most important element of the foundation of peace and security in the world and of the promotion of peaceful  all-round and equitable cooperation among countries and peoples whether with different or with the same or similar socio-economic and political systems. These principles constitute the foundation of the policy of non-alignment that Yugoslavia  which is successfully building its system of social self- management  has been pursuing consistently for many years.80. The positive trends I have referred to are  however  uneven  and are meeting with growing resistance and  ever more  frequently  with the exertion of brutal pressure and the open use of force by the forces of imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and foreign domination in general. Major international political and economic questions are not being solved at a rate and in a manner called for by their acute character; or recourse is made to partial solutions  often outside the United Nations  and regardless of the interests and without the participation of the parties directly concerned. What causes particular concern is the absence of substantive results in solving world economic problems  which results in a constant deterioration of the economic development of developing countries  especially of the least developed ones among them  and still further complicates international economic relations as a whole.81.	The evident stagnation in the development of detente  and the ever more manifest tendencies to limit its scope  pose the question as to whether the world is on the threshold of the revival of certain aspects of cold-war policy. This question is raised by the intensified efforts to deepen the bloc division of the world  to step up the struggle for the extension of spheres of interest  particularly in the areas of non-aligned and other developing countries  and to intensify the arms race.82.	The question arises whether this development has not reached the dangerous limit that should not be overstepped  as this could irreparably threaten peace and security in the world. And is it not high time to exert our utmost efforts so that we can begin to overcome negative tendencies and resistance to the process of relaxation of tensions  as well as to thwart attempts at making use of detente for achieving narrow objectives? We rejoice at every sign which shows that even the most powerful great Powers  whose policies essentially affect the development of the process of detente  are beginning to realize  like the other States Members of the United Nations  where this negative trend in the development of the process of relaxation of international tensions is leading. It remains to be seen whether they are prepared to make the necessary effort  in the same manner as all the other countries  to act decisively in opening prospects for a positive development of detente  which also means a positive development of international relations as a whole. On this occasion also  we wish to express our profound belief that the process of easing international tensions cannot prove to be a lasting one  even in its present limited form  without the participation of all countries in solving crucial international issues and the extension of' detente to all geographical regions and to all spheres of international relations.83.	I wish to draw attention  at this session of the General Assembly also  to the exceptionally important decisions of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held in Colombo last year. The present international situation has confirmed the correctness of the clear and resolute stands adopted by that Conference and the significance of the all-round active involvement of the non-aligned movement as an independent and ever more influential world factor in solving key international problems. The constant efforts exerted by the non-aligned countries since the Fifth Conference in Colombo to implement its decisions gradually  particularly by promoting mutual co-operation and launching initiatives for strengthening broader international co-operation and solidarity  have produced palpable results and constitute a contribution to a positive development of international relations.84.	The non-aligned countries are encountering major problems and obstacles along this road. The problems with which non-aligned countries are faced today are  to a great extent  a legacy of colonial times or a consequence of profound national and social transformations  and are the concern of the broader international community. Differences of views and interests which periodically assume the character of conflicts between some non-aligned countries—which are currently most pronounced in Africa—are not a characteristic feature of the movement as a whole. The non-aligned countries have always surmounted differences and conflicts successfully when their common interests and their activities aimed at solving crucial international issues were involved. We are convinced that the current disputes between some non-aligned countries can be solved peacefully  in accordance with the principles of non-alignment  the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Any attempt by other countries to make use of these disputes or to exacerbate them not only renders their solution more difficult but also creates crises of wider proportions. For that reason my country has consistently advocated the peaceful solution of the disputes which have arisen  or may arise in the future  and is most resolutely opposed to any outside interference by any other State.85.	We resolutely insist on the need to strengthen the solidarity and unity of non-aligned countries. We also believe that the strengthening of the solidarity of all developing countries belonging to the Group of 77 is of vital importance to all developing countries and also of decisive significance for the establishment of the new international economic order.86.	The unity and the influential role of non-aligned countries in international developments is an essential element of stability in the world and one of the most important factors for eliminating the threat of war and strengthening world peace and security. This should be remembered by all those who hope to undermine and disrupt the unity of non-aligned countries  and are actively engaged in efforts to achieve that end.87.	The struggle of non-aligned countries is today the most important factor for overcoming the division of the world into antagonistic military-political blocs  opposing the policy of division of the world into spheres of interest and influence  and strengthening the process of relaxation of international tensions as well as the transformation of this process into universal active and peaceful coexistence.88.	In this respect we are convinced that the importance and the role of the non-aligned movement will constantly grow in the forthcoming period and that its contribution to solving international problems will be ever greater. All influential international entities should realize that their co-operation and dialogue with the non-aligned is the only acceptable relationship with this great international movement  whose historical significance is increasingly recognized in the world.89.	My country actively is participating in the efforts of the non-aligned countries to implement a number of important tasks arising out of the decisions and the action programme adopted by the Fifth Conference  and in the preparations for the ministerial conference of the non- aligned countries which will be held in Belgrade in 1978. As host to that Conference  Yugoslavia will make a maximum effort to contribute to the success of that important gathering in the spirit of continuity of the policy of non-alignment and in the interests of peace and security .in the world and of the struggle to build new and more equitable international political relations and to establish the new international economic order.90.	In this context  the United Nations has already played an important role. It has achieved tangible results in identifying international issues and in determining priorities  principles and ways for solving these problems. However  the greatest weakness of the United Nations resides in the fact that it has not succeeded in ensuring respect for and implementation of its decisions by all the States Members of the world Organization. it is indispensable to start an open dialogue about this problem here within the framework of the United Nations and to arrive at adequate decisions.91.	The agenda of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly contains a large number of items. The number of outstanding international problems is constantly growing  but unfortunately very few questions have been solved successfully and removed from the agenda of the United Nations. I take great pleasure in reminding the Assembly that Yugoslavia  in conjunction with Italy and as a result of the Osimo agreements  has removed two questions from the agenda of the Security Council. This may serve as an example of how it is possible  with mutual efforts and goodwill  to solve a very complex question which had burdened relations between two neighbouring countries and had threatened stability  security and peace in Europe and  more broadly  in the world.92.	Acute focal-points of crisis in several regions of the globe are at the centre of attention during the current session of the General Assembly.93.	The situation in the Middle East is further complicated by the ever more aggressive policy of Israel. The most recent measures aimed at extending the scope of Israeli legislation to the territory of the West Bank of the River Jordan and the Gaza Strip and the establishment of new Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories are part of a continued action by Israel aimed at annexing occupied territories and this poses a direct threat to peace and security in the region and beyond. Besides  Israel continues to deny the national rights of the Palestinian people  whose generally recognized legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization  in spite of the ever more widely accepted fact that the key to the solution of the Middle East crisis lies precisely in the realization of these legitimate rights  including the right of the Palestinian people to establish its own independent State.94.	By its most recent acts of colonization Israel endeavours to perpetuate the occupation of the territories of Arab countries  thereby violating the generally endorsed principles embodied in the United Nations resolutions on withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967. The United Nations should do everything to have Israel comply with its decisions; this means Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian and other Arab territories it occupied in 1967 and the realization of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. This alone can render possible a peaceful  lasting and just solution and guarantee the independence and security of all countries and peoples of the region  including those of Israel. For any such initiative  including the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  to be successful  it is essential that the Palestine Liberation Organization participate  without any conditions  as an equal partner of all the other participants at that Conference. All attempts designed to prevent the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization at the Geneva Conference are fraught with danger. This illusion should be finally discarded by all those responsible for speedily finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Middle East.95.	From' various quarters demands are being addressed to the Palestinians to recognize Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973). Yugoslavia voted in favour of those resolutions and gave them its support  because it felt that they embodied some essential elements for the solution of the crisis in the Middle East  the withdrawal of Israel from Arab territories occupied in 1967 being the most important among them. However  I believe that the vast majority of countries represented in this hall will agree that those two resolutions are not sufficient  since the national entity of the Palestinian people and its right to establish an independent State are not recognized by them. Therefore we believe that the Security Council should adopt a new resolution embodying these two key elements. Then the Council would have defined all the elements relevant to a lasting solution of the Middle East crisis and the appropriate action to be taken by it.96.	All those now involved in the search for a comprehensive solution of the Middle East crisis should take this into consideration and act accordingly if they really wish to speed up progress towards a peaceful and just solution of that crisis.97.	The Cyprus crisis is in the same geographical region. We are very concerned over the absence of any progress in solving the crisis in Cyprus  where ever more frequent attempts are being made to legalize the division by force of the sovereign State of Cyprus. Yugoslavia continues to believe that negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities provide the only way conducive to a lasting solution-negotiations founded on full national equality and based on the generally adopted principles contained in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  which require the preservation of the territorial integrity  independence and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. Our session should give a new impulse towards an accelerated search for a solution of this acute problem under the auspices of the United Nations.98.	For many years we have been absorbed in the problem of apartheid and racism in southern Africa  which directly threatens the independence of neighbouring countries and constitutes an acute international issue affecting peace and security in general. South Africa is engaged in permanent aggression against the Namibian people. Condemning such a practice  the United Nations should take resolute action to implement the decision on the accession of Namibia to independence in 1978 under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ in its capacity as the only legitimate representative of the people ofNamibia.	The situation is also very disturbing owing to the unsolved problem of Southern Rhodesia. Ian Smith's racist regime continues to defy the demand of the international community that it hand over power to the majority of the people of Zimbabwe. It is intensifying its war effort in Southern Rhodesia find simultaneously  with the continuous help of South Africa  it is carrying out constant aggressive actions against Mozambique and other neighbouring countries.99.	The United Nations should offer effective support and assistance to the liberation movements-to SWAPO in Namibia  and to the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe-in their struggle for independence  as well as to the front-line countries in their fight against racism and apartheid. Any lasting solution must be based on full respect for the essential and legitimate interests of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe. Only within this framework is Yugoslavia ready to support anyone's efforts to bring about a peaceful solution of these questions.100.	The United Nations should also fully support the people of South Africa who are fighting against racist terror and for the liquidation of apartheid. The present situation in South Africa could be the source of a crisis of wider international dimensions.101.	According priority to southern Africa  the United Nations should on this occasion again renew its categorical demand for the liquidation of colonialism in the still remaining colonial enclaves wherever they may be. There are no so-called small unresolved colonial questions. What is involved is the equal right of all peoples under colonial rule to self-determination and independence.102.	A new crisis has recently flared up upon the Horn of Africa. The settlement of conflicts and outstanding problems in that region can in our opinion be achieved only by peaceful means on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity and independence of all the countries of the area and by ensuring their free social and economic development. Otherwise this latest conflict in Africa will benefit only those forces that are interested not in strengthening the independence of the African countries but in advancing their own interests and influence in Africa. My country believes that it is the duty of all the States Members of the United Nations to adhere most strictly to these principles. All those countries which act contrary to this are playing with fire which could set ablaze an armed conflict of wider proportions.103.	Although the Korean question is not on the agenda of this session it merits our full attention  because the failure to solve it has broad negative consequences. Yugoslavia supports the politics of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea directed towards the peaceful and independent unification of the Korean people. Yugoslavia urges the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea  the elimination of foreign military bases and the conclusion of a peace treaty which would establish conditions for the Korean people to achieve its national aim of peaceful unification. We believe that the United Nations should more resolutely support these efforts and prevent the legalization of the division of Korea.104.	The signing of the new Panama Canal treaties-which is the result of a persistent and long struggle by the people of Panama and of broad international solidarity  primarily of the Latin American and other non-aligned countries  as well as a result of the readiness of the Government of the United States of America to reach agreement—is an encouraging step towards achieving the effective sovereignty of Panama over the Canal Zone  which will also contribute to the struggle of the peoples of this continent for full political and economic emancipation. We have already congratulated the Governments of Panama and the United States of America on the successful conclusion of the negotiations and the agreement reached  whereby an important step has been made towards solving a long-lasting neuralgic issue.105.	A particular problem for the peace and security of the world is posed by the practice of interference in the internal affairs of other countries and pressure by increasingly varied and subtle methods and forms with the aim of undermining the economic development  the social and political stability and the national unity of independent countries. This so-called indirect aggression  which belongs to the category of so-called special warfare  is directed mainly towards the destabilization of certain non-aligned and other developing countries for the purpose of imposing new aspects of neo-colonialism and hegemony or to overthrow some legal Governments. The non-aligned countries have always accorded exceptional importance to the question of non-interference  having in mind that some of them are in fact the most frequent victims of the form of the use of force. At the Fifth Conference of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo this matter was given special attention and  on the initiative of the non-aligned countries  the thirty-first session of the General Assembly adopted a special resolution dealing comprehensively with this acute cause of international instability. For this reason we fully support the initiative of Guyana on the adoption of a declaration on non-interference  which would be an important contribution to the codification of the principles on which equitable co-operation and democratic and stable relations among States should be built.106.	We have always believed disarmament to be one of the most important problems for which it is most urgent to find a solution. The decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is an essential and timely action that expresses not only the readiness of the international community for the broadest involvement but also the need for concrete measures to halt the arms race and to begin a process conducive to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. At the same time  it is an expression of an awareness that international peace and security in the present-day world cannot be permanently maintained on the balance of forces  military might and division into blocs. The special session will be the broadest and most representative international gathering  and will not only consider this question in principle  but will also adopt an appropriate programme of measures and ensure a greater role and fuller involvement of the United Nations in the process of disarmament-rightly so  as the negotiations on disarmament held so far have not  despite certain results  made possible substantive progress in the field of disarmament itself. We expect all countries  especially the permanent members of the Security Council  to make the necessary effort to enable the special session to achieve tangible results. So far the preparations reflect the determination of many countries to approach the negotiations in a new and more specific manner  as regards both the definition of"" principles and the adoption of specific disarmament measures.107.	Yugoslavia is consistent in its support of the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons  although it has already had an opportunity to criticize strongly  in various international forums  the failure to abide by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  especially by the most powerful nuclear Powers. Yugoslavia  however  rejects attempts by nuclear Powers to establish  under the pretext of halting the proliferation of nuclear armaments  a total monopoly on the transfer and use of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes  which monopoly is a new threat to the sovereignty of all non-nuclear countries for which nuclear technology is indispensable for their economic and social development.108.	I therefore wish especially to emphasize the particular importance of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology and their introduction into the energy systems of the non-nuclear countries  primarily the developing countries. Instead of the fulfilment of existing obligations on the transfer of nuclear technology  a monopoly over the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes is being further strengthened  new obstacles are being created and attempts are being made to impose new obligations on the developing countries. There is therefore an urgent need to find international solutions for ensuring the free transfer of nuclear technology and its use in the interest of the accelerated development of the non-nuclear and  primarily  of the developing countries.109.	Since the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations  when the foundations of the new international economic order were laid  intensive negotiations have taken place between the developing and the developed countries which  despite some progress in identifying the whole complexity of existing economic relations and the unequal position of the developing countries  have not produced the expected results.110.	The existing situation causes us serious concern  and the developing countries cannot accept it. The unsatisfactory result - of the Paris Conference  which did not achieve the indispensable break-through in the sense of establishing the new international economic order  and the well-known outcome of the resumed thirty-first session of the General Assembly  make it imperative to adopt at the current session such decisions as will lead within the shortest possible time to the concrete solution of a certain number of priority international economic problems. This applies  first and foremost  to the forthcoming negotiations both at this session of the General Assembly and within the framework of the UNCTAD on an integral programme for raw materials and for the establishment of the common fund  as well as on the problem of the foreign debts of developing countries  especially the least developed and hardest hit among them  and on the remaining most important international economic problems.111.	In this respect all the States Members of the United Nations should devote full attention to the declaration adopted by the Group of 77 developing countries at yesterday's meeting held at the level of ministers for foreign affairs. That declaration expresses the unanimous views and appraisals of developing countries concerning the present state of international economic relations.112.	The General Assembly at its current session should direct and stimulate negotiations and  in that sense  give priority to the consideration of these problems.113.	In a situation in which we are faced with uncertainty concerning the state of the world economy and the constant worsening of the position of the developing countries  it is high time that all the developed countries  regardless of their socio-economic systems or size  should show the necessary political will to become specifically involved and to contribute to the solution of the acute world economic problems  and thus to contribute by deeds to the establishment of the new international economic order. Yugoslavia believes that without such readiness on the part of all the developed countries it is impossible to achieve true co-operation between the developing and the developed countries  and all of us here in the United Nations consider that the only way to reach a speedy solution of crucial international economic problems.114.	It is clear to all of us that the establishment of the new international economic order is a long-term process  but it is certain that it can and must be built by common efforts and through co-operation. In this regard a special responsibility rests on the developed countries. The developing countries see in the new international economic order a way to solve the most important problems of the world economy as a whole  for which the basic prerequisite is the more rapid development of developing countries and an equitable position for them in international economic relations. An orientation toward co-operation would include a determination to act resolutely with a view to implementing the programmes and decisions adopted so far.115.	Of no less importance is the start of the negotiations to work out a new international strategy for development. For this action the political framework is already embodied in the resolutions on the establishment of the new international economic order. However  it is essential that  having learned from the negative experience of the First and Second United Nations Development Decades  we keep in mind the fact that a new strategy should reflect to the fullest extent the relations of interdependence of allMembers of the international community and define precisely their role  obligations and contribution.116.	All these actions should be directed also towards the strengthening and development of the role of the United Nations  and especially of the General Assembly  as the most appropriate forum for the equitable participation of all countries in the solving of world economic problems. Unfortunately  the activity of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System has not produced the expected results. We urge that this very important work be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible  so that the system of the United Nations may be able to conduct effective negotiations to solve the most acute and long-term international economic problems.117.	In the social and humanitarian field  we attach particular importance to the successful outcome of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  which would be one of the greatest contributions to respect for  and the advancement of  human rights and freedoms as a component part of the struggle for peace  emancipation and social progress. The continuing mass and brutal violations of those rights by colonial and racist regimes and other reactionary forces are a subject of legitimate interest on the part of the international community.118.	Human rights constitute a totality which  in addition to civil and political rights  include economic  social  national  cultural and other rights  and only their integral application ensures their full enjoyment. The realization of these rights is a long and complex historical process conditioned by many historical  social and developmental circumstances. Therefore  it goes without saying that today  too  we must conduct an open and constructive dialogue on the problem of human rights. It is clear that we must all exert great efforts over a long period in order to achieve the exercise of human rights in all their aspects  bearing in mind that this problem is an important element of peace and security in the world.119.	However  singling out some aspects of human rights and attaching absolute significance to them  using them for purposes of political pressure and to infringe the sovereignty of independent States  of bloc rivalries  and imposing one's own social model on others are not activities that will conduce to the actual promotion of those rights. Effective action for the advancement of human rights must be conducted primarily from the position of generally adopted international treaties and the necessity of the accession of the greatest possible number of States to numerous international documents and also their full implementation.120.	The question of ensuring the protection and advancement of the rights of minorities is one the international regulation of which would significantly contribute to the further promotion of human rights. Existing international instruments cover only partially the question of the position of minorities within the framework of the general regulation of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination.121.	Therefore  at the last session of the General Assembly my delegation called upon the United Nations to pay appropriate attention to this problem for the purpose of working out in more detail the obligations of States and adopting an international document devoted to the protection of the rights and the improvement of the position of minorities. In the meanwhile  the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities has recommended to the Commission on Human Rights the elaboration of a draft declaration on minorities  which is a positive first step. A broad approach to this problem  which would ensure the protection both of minority groups and minority individuals  is all the more necessary in view of the constant confirmation of the fact that the regulation of this important question is of great importance to the promotion of co-operation and rapprochement among peoples and States  or  rather  that failure to respect those rights threatens peace and security in many regions of the world.122.	As host to the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which was provided for in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference of 1975  Yugoslavia will act in favour of having the meeting adopt measures for the integral implementation of the Final Act  with the aim of strengthening co-operation and security in Europe and the Mediterranean.123.	I should like to call your attention to the global international importance of the problems of European security and co-operation. The majority of the countries of Europe  as well as the United States of America and Canada  belong to military-political blocs; by far the greatest quantity of armaments and armed forces is in that part of the world; the greatest economic  financial and technological power is concentrated in the hands of those countries. Merely these few obvious facts confirm the broad international importance of European security and cooperation  and thus also the importance of the follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.124.	The Final Act of Helsinki provides a platform not only for detente but also for overcoming division into military-political blocs  and for the expanded implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence  the strengthening of security  the consolidation of peace and the promotion of equitable international co-operation in Europe and in all the world.125.	The countries participating in the follow-up meeting at Belgrade face the task of reaching a constructive agreement on the further strengthening of security and co-operation in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time  Yugoslavia has been exerting efforts towards making the European processes a component part of trends in the world that lead towards the strengthening of peace and security  bearing in mind the fact that Europe could make a much greater contribution to the solution of global questions  especially in the economic field. It is obvious that Europe cannot be an oasis of peace and prosperity  independent from developments in other parts of the world.126.	I believe it is essential  at this session also  to draw attention to the problem of the Mediterranean and the increasingly imperative need to undertake the consideration of the situation in the Mediterranean  which is becoming more and more unfavourable  and to take steps—in the spirit of the decisions of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Colombo  and of the position expressed in the resolution of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly on international security [resolution 31/92J— towards adopting appropriate decisions in the United Nations on the transformation of the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and security. I should also like to inform the General Assembly that attention will be devoted to the problem of the situation in the Mediterranean at the Belgrade meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  with the participation  we hope  of non-European Mediterranean countries  with a view to adopting measures for applying the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act to the Mediterranean region as well.127.	There is no doubt that international relations have worsened in some important areas and that dangerous new situations of crisis have been created. We cannot reconcile ourselves to this state of affairs. The international community has the power to prevent negative developments; this is an expression not just of subjective desires but also of actual possibilities and needs. There has never been a greater number of countries engaged in the building of equitable international co-operation in the world  and  at the same time  there has never been greater awareness of the power of the international community. The priority questions of this session are concerned with the solution of crises and the elimination of focal-points of crisis  primarily in Africa and the Middle East  together with progress towards the adoption of genuine measures of disarmament and the solution of problems of prime importance to the establishment of the new international economic order. It is illusory to think that without progress along these main lines of international relations it is possible to ensure a relaxation of tensions and lasting peace and stability.128.	Therefore it is essential to strengthen the role of the United Nations  which is the most suitable framework for the international community's efforts to solve international problems  and essential to prevent attempts to circumvent the world Organization or to push it into the background. We are  therefore  faced with the constant task of making the world Organization  with the participation of all its Members  more effective and ensuring the implementation of its decisions. "
"139",7606,"ZMB",32,1977,"﻿	1.  Mr. President  on behalf of mydelegation  I wish to congratulate you on your election tothe high office of President of the thirty-second session ofthe United Nations General Assembly. The Zambian delegationwarmly welcomes your election for two importantreasons: First  you are a familiar and respected personalityaround the United Nations. During your successful tour ofduty as Permanent Representative of Yugoslavia to theUnited Nations  you distinguished yourself as a dedicatedand highly competent diplomat with an abiding faith in andcommitment to the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations. Secondly  you represent a great nation and peoplewho have made a tremendous contribution to world peaceand security under the visionary leadership of PresidentTito. We acknowledge  in particular  the contribution ofYugoslavia to the birth and growth of the non-alignedmovement  which today is a dominant force in internationalrelations. In addition  Mr. President  we recognizethe warm relations that exist between our two countriesand peoples. My delegation is certain that your eminentqualities  coupled with the prestige of your occupation ofthe high post of Deputy Foreign Minister  will be aninvaluable contribution to the success of the thirty-secondsession of the General Assembly.2. This is also a propitious moment for me. to pay atribute  Sir  to your predecessor  Mr. Hamilton ShirleyAmerasinghe of Sri Lanka  who presided over the thirty-firstsession of the General Assembly with distinction. Bothyour own presidency and his bear testimony to thecontribution of the non-aligned countries to the achievementof the objectives of justice  peace and development.3. The Zambian delegation warmly welcomes the admissioninto the United Nations of the Socialist Republic ofViet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. We have long heldthat Viet Nam was qualified for United Nations membershipand  together with other non-aligned countries  we have defended its right to belong to this world Organization.4.	The independence of Djibouti  a sister African country and a member of the Organization of African Unity  situated in a sensitive part of Africa  has particular significance. The victory of its people  which relentlessly strove for the independence of their country and for the preservation of its territorial integrity  cannot fail to inspire their brothers and sisters in southern Africa who still have to rid themselves of the shackles of white minority racist and Fascist domination and exploitation. It is imperative that we rededicate ourselves to the liberation of the territories still under colonial and white racist minority domination  so that with their independence we shall have moved still closer towards the goal of universality of membership of the United Nations.5.	Once again we are called upon to assess the contemporary international situation. One naturally wishes that the balance-sheet could indicate that we have moved closer to the objectives we have all undertaken to promote under the United Nations Charter. But  alas  the international situation has not become appreciably better in the last year. In many cases the situation has even worsened; in others a false sense of hope and expectation may have been created  with the concomitant potential of giving way to despair  bitterness and even generalized war. The international economic situation still remains a source of grave concern: the arms race continues unabated; the questions of southern Africa  the Middle East  Cyprus and Korea still await a solution; and new flash-points of conflict have appeared on the horizon.6.	I propose to deal first with the grave issues of development and international economic co-operation.7.	The growing uncertainty of the present economic situation is a source of great concern to my delegation. Despite a few encouraging signs of better economic performance during the past year  the total picture remains gloomy; and  unless vigorous action is taken  the forecast for the remainder of the Second United Nations Development Decade is equally discouraging. Meanwhile  inflation  unemployment  external trade deficits and the revival of certain protectionist tendencies dominate the present economic scene.8.	The people in developing countries continue to suffer from the ominous consequences of a system designed essentially to support and promote the economic and social progress of the industrialized world. They still remain virtually powerless to influence the existing international system and its effects  including the decisions affecting their well-being and destiny. 9.	The logical result of historical deprivation and neglect  including unfulfilled commitments during two Development Decades  is the ever-widening gap between the rich and poor countries. The reality of poverty and inequality deriving from the prevailing international system is familiar to us all. It is  in the view of my delegation  an affront to the moral conscience of humanity—especially when the world has the remedial means  technology and resources  an increasing portion of which is devoted to armaments and other weapons of mass destruction.10.	The decisions adopted by this Assembly at its historic sixth and seventh special sessions  as well as the Charter of Economic Rights. and Duties of States adopted at the twenty-ninth regular session have been instrumental in the emergence of a recognition that the removal of poverty and inequality calls for fundamental changes in the international economic status quo. There is now at least a growing awareness that a new international economic order in which a life of dignity and well-being should be the inalienable right of all will not emerge from marginal changes in the prevailing economic structure. Nor is there any longer faith in the traditional prescriptions of aid and assistance as a cure for the pervasive poverty and inequality.11.	Notwithstanding the growing awareness of interdependence  it is disheartening to note that the responses to the compelling need for a new economic order have  so far  been extremely slow and limited in scope. The outcome of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris  the painfully slow progress in the multilateral trade negotiations  and the assessment of negotiations in UNCTAD have all been disappointing.12.	It is indisputable that  in the prevailing atmosphere of economic uncertainty  the continued absence of concrete and significant results within specific time-frames will have grave repercussions for the ongoing efforts to achieve genuine international economic co-operation on the basis of the consensus obtained at the seventh special session. Within the framework of that consensus many pressing issues of intimate concern to the developing countries remain unsolved  including commodity trade  external debt  international monetary reform  balance of payments  transfer of real resources  and access to capital and trade markets of the developed countries. Accordingly  it is imperative that during the current session we focus our efforts on generating new political momentum to facilitate the ongoing and future negotiations on such issues in the appropriate bodies of the United Nations system. It is in our common interest jealously to protect the hard-won consensus from the real risk of dissipation.13.	Any consideration of priorities among the pressing needs cannot fail to highlight in particular commodity and debt problems. In this connexion  my delegation would urge the full and speedy implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities adopted in resolution 93 (IV) at the fourth session of UNCTAD. We would equally urge the developed countries to demonstrate political willingness in the course of the forthcoming negotiations so as to facilitate the early establishment of the common fund as the central element of the Integrated Programme for Commodities.14.	The critical debt problems facing the developing nations merit serious and sympathetic reconsideration by the developed countries so as to facilitate the early provision of effective and meaningful solutions during the forthcoming ministerial session of the Trade and Development Board. In the continued absence of fair  remunerative prices and the secular decline in the purchasing power of their primary exports  on which they depend  the developing countries are obliged to borrow what they are in fact entitled to earn. To that extent  international credit does not serve its developmental role. It is not inconceivable that in some cases developing countries have to incur debts in order to finance debts.15.	In the field of industrial co-operation  the effective method by which the developed countries can assist the developing countries to industrialize is to provide them with greater market access for the kind of goods in which they have an advantage. The role of industrialization  like that of agriculture  has become increasingly crucial in the satisfaction of basic needs and in the reduction of income disparities within the developing countries.16.	My delegation calls upon the industrialized countries to ensure that the multilateral trade negotiations acquire a sense of urgency and purpose.17.	The obligation to ensure the survival of a large segment of mankind is a global one and should be shared equitably by all  regardless of responsibility for the exploitation  poverty and deprivation of the developing countries.18.	I should  however  like to reaffirm Zambia's conviction that progress towards the new international economic order will be dependent largely on the political commitment and willingness of the developed countries.19.	Undoubtedly  the developing countries acknowledge primary responsibility for the sustained development of their own societies. They acknowledge that self-reliance  at both the national and other collective levels  is an essential feature of development.20.	Zambia attaches great significance to the vital subject of economic co-operation among developing countries. It is our strong belief that the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  to be held next year  assumes a special dimension within the over-all context of the new international economic order  and in the light of the action programmes adopted by both the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Colombo in August 1976  and the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Mexico City in September 1976.21.	The international community is at the cross-roads in the field of development and economic co-operation. The search for viable and effective solutions in all the pressing areas under deliberation and negotiation can be greatly assisted by an enlightened appreciation of the interdependence and community of interest which can readily be perceived in various areas  including commodities  manufactures  debts and industrialization.22.	It is Zambia's firm belief that there is a great need for the international community  particularly the developed countries  to educate their populations so that they can better appreciate the reality of interdependence and community of interest. A better-informed public opinion will equally be able to perceive the benefits  to the rich countries as well as to world peace and security  which would derive from the accelerated development of the third world.23.	There are  undoubtedly  other important areas  including that of the law of the sea  in which the principles of interdependence and community of interest can and should be recognized and respected as a viable basis for genuine international dialogue and negotiation. Accordingly  the international community must recognize the urgency of the imperative need to establish a just  equitable and lasting legal order governing the seas—an order which duly respects the legitimate rights and interests of all nations.24.	It is the firm belief of my Government that the introduction of the principles of justice and equity in this area  as in the economic and other fields  would constitute a major contribution to international peace and security.25.	The situation in the Middle East has for decades defied solution and remains a serious threat to international peace and security. The problem here is clearly that of Israeli intransigence. Israel continues to treat with contempt United Nations resolutions demanding its withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a homeland. Efforts at reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East are being frustrated by Israel  which persists in its refusal to allow the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.26.	My Government firmly believes that there simply cannot be a durable settlement of the problem of the Middle East if the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  as represented by the PLO  are naively denied. The Palestinian people  who have suffered for far too long  must have a homeland. Equally important is the need to have Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab territories. The acquisition of foreign territory by forceful means is totally inadmissible. And  to compound this problem  the Israelis have embarked on a deliberate programme of legitimizing Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. My Government strongly condemns this and urges Israel to desist from so illegal and dangerous a course.27.	The threat to the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus remains real. As we have done before  we demand the withdrawal of all foreign military forces which continue to occupy parts of Cyprus in utter defiance of United Nations resolutions. We also urge the immediate resumption of the talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General.28.	We remain concerned about the question of Belize. We strongly support the right of the people of Belize to self-determination  independence and territorial integrity. Similarly  we support the right of Panama to full sovereignty over the Panama Canal  and welcome in this regard the recently concluded treaties between Panama and the United States.29.	Zambia's position on the question of Korea remains clear and firm. We support the tireless efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to seek the peaceful reunification of that artificially divided peninsula  in accordance with the North-South joint communiqué of 4 July 1972. The presence of thousands of foreign forces in South Korea is certainly not conducive to efforts at peaceful reunification. We therefore reiterate our demand for the withdrawal of those forces and for the termination of the so-called United Nations Command.30.	There can be no genuine international peace and security in a world characterized by a massive and intensive arms build-up. Unless and until States abandon the notion that military might guarantees their security  however defined  the goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control will remain a pipe- dream. The arms race will continue and will grow even more intense  so long as States entertain the illusion that military superiority is a yardstick for power  prestige and influence. Indeed  as long as actual and potential causes of conflict in the world are not eradicated  the arms race can be neither abated nor reversed.31.	Thus  Zambia subscribes to the proposals for a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament and a World Disarmament Conference. We must make a real start in the field of disarmament on .the basis of premises and general principles that can truly guarantee durable peace and security in the world. It remains the conviction of my Government that priority in the field of disarmament should be accorded to the destruction and complete eradication of nuclear weapons. To this end  Zambia looks forward to the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament to be held next year  and hopes that States will seize that rare opportunity to reflect seriously on the consequences of this race to oblivion.32.	The Indian Ocean has become a focal-point of great-Power rivalry for supremacy. The security and interests of littoral and hinterland States are threatened by the ever-increasing militarization of the Indian Ocean.33.	We urge the full implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace The great Powers and the other major maritime users of the Indian Ocean should co-operate fully  with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. Further  it is the view of my Government that the proposed meeting of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean should be held without delay.34.	Zambia is also seriously concerned about the situation in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahara. It is in the interest of Africa that these problems be resolved amicably as a matter of urgency. In the meantime  we call upon the major Powers to refrain from direct or indirect involvement in these trouble spots  .as such involvement can aggravate the situation.35.	The grave situation in southern Africa is of particular concern to us in Zambia. Because of our geopolitical location and our firm belief in the principles of justice and equality  including the right of all peoples to self- determination and independence  we cannot but remain affected and involved in the events in. the region of southern Africa. Conflict has been all around us since we gained our independence 13 years ago  and we still remain intimately affected and deeply involved in the growing conflict in Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa— that bastion of all evil in southern Africa. We have a generation of Zambians who have lived through and know nothing but sustained conflict on our borders. They are convinced  as are the older generations of Zambia  that only the total liberation of southern Africa will guarantee the security  peace and tranquillity for which they yearn.36.	The people of Zambia are encouraged by the success of the armed struggle in the liberation of southern Africa. The oppressed peoples are determined  more than ever before  to liberate themselves. Political consciousness among them has spread like a bush fire. The gallant freedom fighters have intensified the struggle and are scoring impressive victories over the enemy  and final victory is certain.37.	The response of the panic-stricken racist minority regimes has been the intensification of their savage brutality against the black civilian populations. Their reign of terror is  more than ever before  characterized by intimidation  arrests  imprisonment  torture and the systematic mass murder of innocent civilians. The racist minority regimes have also escalated their acts of aggression against Angola  Botswana  Mozambique and my own country  Zambia  in the vain attempt to dissuade these neighbouring independent African countries from supporting the struggle of the oppressed people. The acts of aggression committed against these countries are also intended to tempt them into direct military involvement in the conflict between the racist minority regimes and the people they oppress. The situation in southern Africa is  therefore  dangerously worsening and posing an even greater threat to international peace and security.38.	It is the duty of the international community to respond positively to this grave situation because the attitude of the world community is an important factor in the struggle for liberation. The racist minority regimes have persisted so long because major Western countries have paid only lip service to the struggle of the oppressed people  while fraternizing with these regimes and acquiescing in their policies and practices. It is encouraging that there now appears to be emerging a general appreciation in the international community of the need to overthrow the forces of evil in Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and South- Africa.39.	The success of the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  held in Maputo in May  and the World Conference for Action against Apartheid  held in Lagos in August  is indicative of the growing solidarity of the international community with the oppressed people of southern Africa. We welcome  in particular  the encouraging attitude of the new United States administration. But we urge the United States and its allies in Western Europe  in keeping with the spirit of Maputo and Lagos  to take practical measures that will permanently reverse the policies of their Governments in southern Africa and bring pressure to bear on the minority regimes. Those countries must join with the rest of the international community in the implementation of the Programme of Action for The Liberation of Zimbabwe and Namibia  adopted at Maputo and the Programme of Action on South Africa adopted at the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly We call  in particular  for the termination of their economic and military relations with South Africa.40.	Let me now turn to the specific issue of Rhodesia. The intensification and victories of the armed struggle in Rhodesia have led to a flurry of initiatives for a negotiated settlement. After the failure of the Kissinger initiatives of 1976  we are now confronted with the new Anglo- American proposals. The significance of the current Anglo- American initiatives is that  at long last  the United Kingdom intends to assume the responsibility over Southern Rhodesia which we in Zambia have always argued it possessed. The United Kingdom came to the Security Council to seek help  and we hope that  having been given that help  it will leave no stone unturned in resolving the situation. Equally significant is the involvement of the United States  the Power to which the racist minority regimes have always looked for protection.41.	Zambia  together with the other front-line States  has lent its qualified support to the Anglo-American proposals contained in the white paper as providing a basis for further negotiations. The over-all position of the front-line States on these proposals was eloquently presented to this Assembly by President Samora Machel of Mozambique .42.	In so far as the proposals are concerned  I think  it ought to be said that the majority of them are not new to us. Except for the proposal relating to the Zimbabwe Development Fund  the foundation and substance for the rest are what we in Africa have been advocating ever since the rebellion in Southern Rhodesia. The principles contained therein are those for which we have  over the years  tried to solicit the support of the Western countries. Our most eloquent document embodying these principles is the Insaka Manifesto adopted in 1969 by the Heads of State of East and Central Africa and subsequently endorsed by the OAU and the United Nations.43.	Our question to the United Kingdom and the United States is  therefore  simply this  What decisive action are the two countries and their Western allies willing and ready to take if. Smith and his henchmen refuse to give up power as envisaged in the proposals? The white paper is silent on this vital question. Yes  indeed  there may be a change of heart in the Western world; but we know that moral force  as opposed to concrete and decisive action  will not move Smith. He will not reject the white paper outright; but one thing we are sure of: he will procrastinate and prevaricate. Indeed  Smith's trick in this  as always  will be to buy time  and thus to perpetuate his illegal regime.44.	In this respect His Excellency President Kaunda of Zambia has recently stated:""The British-American-backed White Paper stands on a glaringly false principle of the willingness of Smith to volunteer to surrender. On this premise  this move is a non-starter. It is a no-move. Twelve long years are enough for anyone even with the dimmest understanding of that madman to know that he will not volunteer.""45.	1 can assure you that from all indications Smith has not changed and has no intention of capitulating.46.	The success of the Anglo-American proposals will depend on the willingness of the United States and the United Kingdom to take decisive enforcement measures. We urge those two countries  together with their Western allies  to seal off the oil lines in order to immobilize both the military and the civil machines which have sustained the Smith regime for this long. The Western multinational oil companies must be prevented from continuing their oil supplies to South Africa  directly or indirectly.47.	The international community has time and again expressed the desire to see a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia  but we are convinced that the illegal Smith regime will only relinquish power and accept majority rule when sufficient pressure is brought to bear on it. Zambia believes that a determined effort to tighten sanctions  particularly oil sanctions  could increase the chances of a timely and peaceful transfer of power in Rhodesia. As President Kaunda has stressed: .. there could be no greater contribution to the liberation struggle today in southern Africa than to end the sale of oil to rebel Rhodesia."" This fact  fortunately  was underscored by the Commonwealth Heads of Government  at their London meeting from 8 to 15 June 1977 when they recognized that:""... the breach of sanctions  particularly in respect of petroleum and petroleum products  is a crucial factor in the survival of the illegal regime in Rhodesia.""48.	It is against this background that Zambia has decided to take legal proceedings against five Western oil companies which have subsidiaries in Rhodesia for their role in an oil conspiracy breaching sanctions and causing great financial loss to Zambia.49.	We believe that the stage has now been set for the removal of Smith and his illegal regime. The international community represented here should use all methods at its disposal  but while negotiations are under way the armed struggle should continue until total victory has been achieved. Nothing should be done to interfere with or sabotage it.50.	On Namibia  my Government firmly believes that the independence of Namibia and its territorial integrity are not subject to compromise. Further  Zambia's position is that any proposal for a negotiated settlement must take fully into account all relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. In this regard Security Council resolution 385 (1976) is particularly vital  as it incorporates all the basic positions of the United Nations on the question of Namibia. Member States should therefore desist from giving a selective interpretation of that resolution  which must be seen and taken as a whole.51.	We commend the United Nations for the positive role it has continued to take in seeking a just solution to the Namibian problem. The United Nations Council for Namibia is a vital organ in the implementation of the decisions of the United Nations and should be given greater support than has been forthcoming hitherto.52.	Zambia fully supports the position of the South West Africa People's Organization with regard to the current initiatives of the five Western countries to seek the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia. It is imperative  in our view  that any general election in Namibia be preceded by the complete withdrawal of all South African military forces. Such withdrawal  coupled with the immediate release of political prisoners  detainees and restricted persons as well as the return of all Namibian exiles  would create the right atmosphere for a genuine national election in Namibia. South African political machinations designed to revive the spirit of the Turnhalle are totally unacceptable. We condemn them.53.	I wish to stress here the importance of preserving the territorial integrity of Namibia. We in Zambia categorically condemn the South African annexation of Walvis Bay  which we shall continue to regard as an integral part of Namibian territory. This action by South Africa  coupled with the unilateral appointment of a so-called Administrator-General for Namibia  is an act of bad faith in the current efforts to reach a negotiated settlement. Such deceptive manoeuvres and desperate acts will lead to an escalation of the armed struggle  to which Zambia is resolutely committed.54.	Apartheid South Africa is at the core of the constellation of the forces of evil in southern Africa. The Pretoria regime has arrogantly pursued its insidious brutality and terror against the freedom-loving people in South Africa. The untimely death of that gallant South African Steven Biko is but the latest in a calculated programme of annihilating all opponents of apartheid.55.	The revolt in South Africa is spreading like a bush fire. The bloody events of Soweto  Alexandra and Langa have continued to inspire the enslaved people of South Africa  who are more determined than ever before to overthrow the apartheid system  which has oppressed them for far too long.56.	A new and critical dimension added to the southern African conflict is South Africa's programme of developing nuclear weapons for aggressive purposes. This development undoubtedly poses an increased threat to international peace and security. However  nuclear weapons will not deter the oppressed people struggling for their rights  nor will it deter the independent African countries which support their cause.57.	We call for a mandatory arms embargo and the imposition of economic sanctions  including oil sanctions  against South Africa. We note with satisfaction that the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which recently held its fourteenth regular session in Libreville  Gabon  decided to appoint a committee consisting of seven members which will visit the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with a view to implementing oil sanctions against South Africa. In all these efforts we shall need the fullest co-operation of all Member States represented in this Assembly.58.	The role of the United Nations in finding lasting solutions in all the areas I have discussed is increasingly crucial. Both the viability and the effectiveness of our world body in fulfilling the mission it has assigned itself under the Charter ultimately depend on the political will which all of us should be prepared to demonstrate.59.	The United Nations has at times not lived up to expectations. Nevertheless  because of its universality it still remains the only world body to which we can pin our hopes for lasting peace. "
